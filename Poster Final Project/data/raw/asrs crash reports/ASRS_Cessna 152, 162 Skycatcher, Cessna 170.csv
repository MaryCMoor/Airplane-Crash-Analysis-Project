I WAS ALMOST FLIPPED ONTO MY BACK (INVERTED). I COULDN'T TELL IF THE ENG CEASED DUE TO THE MIXTURE BEING LEANED OR DUE TO THE PROP STRIKING THE GND. I SHUT DOWN ALL FUEL AND ELECTRICAL EQUIP AND LOOKED FOR ANY SIGN OF FUEL LEAKAGE. NONE WAS DETECTED SO I TURNED THE MASTER ON AND CONTACTED GND AND TOLD THEM WHAT HAD HAPPENED. THEY CONTACTED THE DIAMOND JET AND TOLD THEM 'THEY ALMOST CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT AND THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO CONTACT THEM IF THEY WERE GOING TO DO A FULL PWR RUN-UP.'

I CALLED THE TWR AND THEY BLAMED THE MECHS FOR NOT TELLING THE TWR. THE MECHS BLAMED THE TWR FOR TAXIING ME BEHIND THEM.

WHY WOULD A TWR TAXI AN ACFT ON THE ONLY PARALLEL TXWY PERPENDICULAR TO A POSSIBLE JET WHICH WOULD BE DOING A FULL RUN-UP?

HOWEVER; THE RPTR DID LISTEN TO THE TWR TAPES AND COULD UNDERSTAND WHY THERE WAS CONFUSION WITH REGARD TO THE MECHS UNDERSTANDING OF HOLDING THEIR RUN-UP UNTIL THE SMA ACFT PASSED BEHIND THEIRS. HE FURTHER STATED THAT THE TWR AT NO TIME ASKED HIM TO HOLD BEFORE HE CROSSED IN BACK OF THE JET.

HE APPEARED TO BE FOLLOWING THE RAILROAD TRACKS APPROX 3 MI NE OF JVL ARPT; AND HDG ABOUT 120 DEGS SE. OUR ALT WAS 1600-1700 FT MSL; AND CLBING; AND I WAS WONDERING WHERE HE WAS GOING WHEN I HEARD THEM ON THE JVL TWR FREQ 118.8 SAYING 'THEY WERE ALMOST HIT BY A C-152.' UPON RETURN TO THE ARPT; I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM THE PLT OF THE AZTEC WAS ASKED IF I WAS THE PIC OF THE C-152; MY HDG; AND ALT; AND IF I HAD SEEN HIM CLOSING ON ME. I REPLIED; 'NO; NOT UNTIL PASSING BELOW; AND BEHIND ME ON THE R.' HE THEN STATED; 'HE WAS DSNDING THROUGH 2000 FT MSL; AND THAT WE WERE ONLY 4-5 SECONDS FROM IMPACT; AND THAT HIS SPD WAS 100 KTS;' AND ASKED MY AIRSPD. I REPLIED '65 KT.' THAT WAS THE BULK OF THE SHORT AND ANGRY CONVERSATION. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: ON A GOOD VFR DAY; ESPECIALLY A WKEND; AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF ACFT DSND UPON JVL TO GO TO THE RESTAURANT AT THE TERMINAL. AT PEAK TIMES; AS WAS THIS; THERE ARE SO MANY ACFT INBOUND THE CTLRS CAN'T KEEP UP WITH ALL THE TFC; AND RADIO CALLS BECOME VERY HURRIED TO SAY THE LEAST. AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME; FREQ CONGESTION WAS SO BAD FROM ARRIVING/DEPARTING ACFT; THE STUDENT AND I SHUT DOWN THE ENG TO SAVE FUEL ON THE RAMP WHILE TRYING TO GET A TAXI CLRNC. WHEN FINALLY GETTING A WORD IN AND RECEIVING ONE; WE TAXIED AS INSTRUCTED. WE WERE ADVISED TO THEN BACK TAXI RWY 36 AND RPT WHEN READY. WE WERE READY QUITE SOME TIME AND TRYING TO CALL FOR TKOF CLRNC WHEN THE TWR FINALLY CALLED US TO ASK IF WE WERE READY FOR TKOF. WE SAID 'AFFIRMATIVE' AND WERE CLRED FOR A R TURN OUT. THE STUDENT I WAS WITH WAS ONLY ABOUT 3 HRS INTO TRAINING; AND FLIES ONCE A MONTH IF SHE CAN. TKOF WAS STRENUOUS AS I HAD TO ASSIST AND WATCH AIRSPD VERY CLOSELY. CLBOUT WAS A STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN VY IN THE VERY LIGHT TURB; AND SHE REQUIRED A CONSTANT ASSIST WITH THE PITCH TO CONTINUE THE CLB. ALL THIS WHILE WATCHING FOR THE AZTEC AHEAD OF US THAT HAD RPTED INBOUND FROM THE N. AT 1200 FT MSL WE MADE A TURN TO THE R TO HEAD FOR THE E TRAINING AREA; AND CONTINUED TO CLB (HDG 090 DEGS). A MIN OR SO AFTER IS WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WERE' 1) THE INABILITY OF THE STUDENT TO CTL ACFT. 2) INSTRUCTOR'S ATTN FOCUSED ON MAINTAINING ACFT CTL. 3) EXTREME FREQ CONGESTION. 4) NUMEROUS INBOUND AND DEPARTING ACFT. OTHER PROBABLE CAUSES: 1) AZTEC WAS SUPPOSEDLY HIGH AND TO THE L; L WING MAY HAVE BEEN BLIND SPOT. 2) PLT OF AZTEC HAD HIGH WORKLOAD PREPARING TO LAND AND TRYING TO DECIPHER ACFT POS FROM EXTREMELY CONGESTED FREQ. 3) CTLRS UNABLE TO GIVE TFC RPTS DUE TO EXTRA HVY WORKLOAD AT THE TIME. HOW IT WAS DISCOVERED: UPON LOOKING DOWN; BEHIND AND TO THE R; THEN HEARING THE NEAR MIDAIR COLLISION BEING RPTED BY THE PLT OF THE AZTEC ON JVL TWR FREQ.

WHEN IT CAME TO THE RADIO CALL; I ACTUALLY DIALED IN 121.5 ON OUR COM (FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 300 HRS OF INSTRUCTING) AND; SINCE BOTH PUSH-TO-TALK SWITCHES WERE BROKEN; PICKED UP THE HANDHELD MIKE AND SAID 'MAYDAY; MAYDAY; MAYDAY; CESSNA 25283; LOST PWR; GOING DOWN 2 MI W OF BOONTON RESERVOIR. PLEASE SEND HELP.' AS I PUT THE MIKE DOWN; I SUDDENLY REALIZED THAT MY CLENCHED FIST HAD DEPRESSED THE XMIT BUTTON ON THE HANDHELD. AFTER A COUPLE OF SECONDS OF SHOCK; I GOT BACK ON THE RADIO AND SAID SOMETHING LIKE 'THAT WAS NOT A GENUINE EMER CALL; REPEAT; NEGATIVE EMER!' A VOICE ON THE OTHER END CAME BACK; ASKING ABOUT AN ACFT GOING DOWN NEAR BOONTON RESERVOIR. I REPEATED 'NEGATIVE EMER; THERE IS NO EMER OVER BOONTON' TO WHICH THE VOICE REPLIED; 'UNDERSTAND NO EMER OVER BOONTON;' AND I CONFIRMED THIS.

I CONTACTED RDG APCH WHEN I WAS ABOUT 2 MI W. I NOTIFIED THE CTLR THAT I NEEDED TO LAND PROMPTLY BECAUSE I WAS LOW ON FUEL. THE CTLR ASKED ME IF I WAS DECLARING AN EMER; AND I REPLIED; 'AFFIRMATIVE;' BECAUSE I FELT IT WAS BETTER JUDGEMENT TO RISK DISCIPLINARY ACTION THAN TO ENGAGE IN A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SIT WHILE TRAVELING AWAY FROM THE ARPT TO THE NW. THE CTLR THEN IMMEDIATELY CLRED ME TO LAND ON RWY 13. I LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT AND TELEPHONED THE CTLR AS HE INSTRUCTED ME TO DO. WHILE TAXIING TO THE RAMP WITH MY TAILWHEEL ON THE GND. THE REMAINING GAS IN MY TANKS FLOWED TO THE REAR CAUSING MY ENG TO STOP ABOUT 50 FT FROM THE TIE-DOWN AREA. THE OWNER'S MANUAL STATES THAT THE AIRPLANE HOLDS 42 GALLONS; BUT ONLY 37.5 GALLONS ARE USABLE. 1) I ALWAYS MONITOR MY FUEL BY 2 METHODS: A) THE FUEL GAUGES; AND B) BY KEEPING A WRITTEN RECORD OF MY TACHOMETER TIME AND THE AMOUNT OF FUEL TAKEN ABOARD AT EACH REFUELING. THE GAUGES SERVE AS A ROUGH MEASUREMENT OF FLT TIME REMAINING; AND THE TACH SERVES FOR FLT PLANNING AND ALSO WHEN THE REMAINING FLT TIME IS GETTING LOW. THIS AIRPLANE HAS ALWAYS BURNED SLIGHTLY MORE THAN 7.8 GALLONS PER HR FOR THE 21 YRS THAT I'VE OWNED IT; AND I'VE ALWAYS USED THAT RATE IN MY 'TACHOMETER TIME' FLT PLANNING. HOWEVER; ABOUT 25 FLT HRS AGO A MECH DISASSEMBLED THE CARB TO EXAMINE THE FLOAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN ACFT ADVISORY; AND APPARENTLY WHEN HE REASSEMBLED THE CARB HE SET THE FIXED MIXTURE ADJUSTMENT SUBSTANTIALLY RICHER THAN IT HAD BEEN. I CAME TO THIS CONCLUSION AFTER THIS INCIDENT BY EXAMINING MY WRITTEN TACH REFUELING RECORDS AND DISCOVERING THAT I HAVE BEEN BURNING ABOUT 8.5 GALLONS PER HR. 2) ABOUT 3 FLT HRS BEFORE THIS INCIDENT I NOTICED A SLIGHT REDUCTION IN ENG PERFORMANCE UPON TKOF AND CLB. I DISCOVERED THAT MY CARB HEAT PUSH-PULL CTL CABLE HAD BROKEN; AND AS A RESULT I HAD BEEN FLYING WITH FULL CARB HEAT ON. THIS INCREASED MY FUEL CONSUMPTION EVEN MORE. 3) ON MY FLT TO LRP ON THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT THE WX WAS EXTREMELY HAZY. UPON TKOF FROM EASTON ARPT I RPTED TO ALLENTOWN APCH CTL AND OBTAINED FLT FOLLOWING RADAR SURVEILLANCE. ALLENTOWN THEN HANDED ME OFF TO FINAL LEG. AS I NEARED LANCASTER ARPT THE HARRISBURG CTLR VECTORED ME A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE ON PAST THE ARPT TO THEN BRING ME BACK AND LINE ME UP FOR MY APCH AND LNDG. THIS EXTENDED MY PLANNED FLYING TIME ABOUT AN ADDITIONAL 15 MINS. I DID NOT REFUEL AT LANCASTER BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE 80 OCTANE GASOLINE; AND AFTER PAYING FOR 2 MAJOR ENG OVERHAULS (THE LAST ONE COSTING MORE THAN THE AIRPLANE COST NEW) I AVOID 100 OCTANE WHENEVER POSSIBLE. ORDINARILY; WITHOUT THOSE 3 UNFORESEEN FACTORS; I WOULD HAVE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH FUEL TO FLY FROM LANCASTER TO SLATINGTON WHERE I BUY MOST OF MY 80 OCTANE GAS. THE LANCASTER CTLR'S ACTIONS THROUGHOUT THIS INCIDENT WERE EXCELLENT AND IMMEDIATE. 2 THINGS I 'LEARNED ABOUT FLYING' FROM THIS ARE 1) IF EVEN JUST A SLIGHT CHANGE IN ENG PERFORMANCE IS NOTED; INVESTIGATE IT BEFORE FLYING AGAIN (BROKEN CARB HEAT PUSH-PULL CABLE); AND 2) IF ONLY 100 OCTANE GAS IS AVAILABLE; HALF-FILL THE TANKS IF NECESSARY TO PROVIDE AN AMPLE SAFETY MARGIN FOR THE FLT TO AN ARPT WITH 80 OCTANE. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR FLIES A 1955 CESSNA 170B. THERE IS AN OUTSTANDING AD ON THE CARB OF HIS ENG REQUIRING THAT THE 2 PIECE VENTURI BE INSPECTED EACH YR; THEN REPLACED NO LATER THAN DECEMBER; 1966; ON THE ADVICE OF A MECH. THE RPTR HAS REPLACED THE 2 PIECE VENTURI WITH A NEW 1 PIECE VENTURI. HE HAS FOUND THAT THIS INCREASED THE FUEL CONSUMPTION AS WELL AS THE OTHER FAULTS THAT HE FOUND IN HIS RPT. HE HOPES THAT THE ASRS CAN HELP PROMULGATE THE WORD ON THIS FUEL INCREASE. THE RPTR IS HIGHLY PLEASED WITH THE HANDLING THAT HE GOT FROM RDG TRACON. HE HAS HEARD NOTHING FROM THE FAA ABOUT THIS INCIDENT. THE RPTR IS NOW AWARE OF THE FAA AVIATION SAFETY HOTLINE AND WILL RPTTHE FUEL USE INCREASE THERE.

A BE23 'SPORT' WAS IN L CLOSED TFC RWY 34 RWY 27 IS 5400 FT AND RWY 34 IS 2200 FT XING RWY 27 4000 FT FROM RWY 27 THRESHOLD. RWY 34 CROSSES RWY 27 ABOUT 1500 FT FROM RWY 34 THRESHOLD. UGA X WAS CLRED FOR TOUCH AND GO FROM L DOWNWIND RWY 27. CGA Y WAS EXTENDED DOWNWIND RWY 34 TO INCREASE SEPARATION FROM UGA Y WITH UGA X ON 3/4 MI FINAL RWY 27; I TOLD CGA Y BASE WAS AT HIS DISCRETION AND CLRED FOR OPTION RWY 34. 2 OTHER ACFT CALLED AT THIS TIME INBOUND. I OBSERVED UGA X FLARING FOR LNDG RWY 27 AND B. CGA X TURNING 1 MI FINAL RWY 34. AT THIS TIME; 1 OF THE 2 INBOUNDS CORRECTED ME ON HIS CALL SIGN. I OBSERVED CGA X SHORT FINAL RWY 34 (ABOUT 600 FT TO THRESHOLD) AND UGA X PWRING UP RWY 27 (ABOUT 1000 FT TO RWY INTXN) COMPLETING TOUCH AND GO. I TOLD CGA X TO 'GAR.' UGA X NEVER RESPONDED BUT AS IT LIFTED OFF IT IMMEDIATELY STARTED TO DSND (FROM ABOUT 10-20 FT AGL) WHICH I ASSUMED TO MEAN THE ACFT WAS LNDG. CGA Y WAS STILL VERY LOW SO I TOLD HIM 'TURN L AS SOON AS ABLE.' AS FAST AS UGA X HAD STARTED ITS DSCNT; UGA X WAS NOW CLBING; SO I TOLD TO 'TURN R;' WITH NO RESPONSE. I SAID NOTHING MORE FROM THIS POINT UNTIL THEY HAD PASSED. AT THIS POINT LET ME TELL YOU MY THOUGHTS ON WHAT WAS HAPPENING. BOTH ACFT ARE BASED AT THE FIELD AND ONE IS OPERATED BY A FLT SCHOOL (CX52). THE BEECH IS PRIVATELY OWNED; BUT ITS OWNER AND OPERATOR IS BELIEVED TO BE A STUDENT PLT. I DID NOT WANT TO ISSUE COMPLEX INSTRUCTIONS TO EITHER ACFT BUT WANTED TO ISSUE ONLY BASIC INSTRUCTIONS. I SENT CGA X 'AROUND' TO GET HIM PWRED UP AND CLBING. I WANTED TO STOP UGA X ON THE GND. CGA Y WAS GOING AROUND BUT NOT CLBING. I THOUGHT HE PROBABLY STILL HAD HIS FLAPS DOWN AND THAT IS WHY I ISSUED THE 'L TURN WHEN ABLE.' AT THAT SECOND I THOUGHT UGA X WAS BASICALLY NO FACTOR AND I DID NOT WANT CGA Y MAKING AN ABRUPT TURN POSSIBLY CAUSING A STALL AND CRASH. WHEN UGA X STARTED LIFTING AGAIN (AND REALIZING MY ABORT HAD NOT BEEN RECEIVED) I ISSUED A R TURN BELIEVING CGA Y WAS ABOUT TO START A L TURN. CGA Y NEVER TURNED AND UGA X SUDDENLY DSNDED FROM ABOUT 40 FT TO ABOUT 20 FT. THAT LED ME TO ASSUME WITH CONFIDENCE UGA X HAD THE BEECH IN SIGHT AND ANY FURTHER CALLS ON MY PART MIGHT HAVE MADE THE SIT WORSE. I WAS NEVER SURE UNTIL AFTER THEY PASSED; IF CGA Y MIGHT BE CONFUSED AND STILL MIGHT TRY TO LAND. THE PROB WASN'T THE NEAR MISS AT THE XING RWYS. THE PROB WAS EARLIER; WHEN I LET MYSELF BE DISTR FROM MY INTERSECTING RWYS. TIMING LOOKED GOOD WHEN THE BEECH TURNED HIS BASE. TIMING LOOKED OK WHEN HE TURNED FINAL; AND THAT'S WHEN I SHOULD HAVE EITHER WATCHED CLOSER OR CORRECTED THAT SIT. I HAVE WORKED INTERSECTING RWYS MANY TIMES OVER THE LAST 4 1/2 YRS AND HAVE ALWAYS MADE IT WORK. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1) TFC AT ARPT OVER THE LAST 2 YRS HAS DIED OFF CONSIDERABLY. 2) IT WAS A TYPICAL SLOW DAY. 3) I WAS NOT USING HEADSET AND USING SPEAKER. 4) TWR CABIN BACKGND NOISE. 5) I WAS RELAXED AND OVER CONFIDENT. OTHER FACTORS: 1) LEAVING SIT ALONE. SENDING CGA Y 'AROUND SPED HIM UP TO THE INTXN. OPERATOR ERROR STILL WOULD HAVE HAPPENED BUT NOT AS CLOSE; MAYBE? 2) RELYING ON CGA TOO MUCH. I STILL THINK THE ACFT WAS CAPABLE OF GOING AROUND AND MAKING A COMPLETE L TURN PRIOR TO REACHING OTHER RWY. 3) CGA Y REPEATING THE 'ABORT TKOF' MADE UGA X DISREGARD MESSAGE BELIEVING MESSAGE FOR ANOTHER ACFT. 4) UGA X NOT BEING ISSUED RWY 34 TFC AND TAKING EXTRA TIME ON 'TOUCH AND GO.' 5) DISTANCES AND WIND. UGA X HAD ABOUT 1.5 MI FROM INTXN WHILE CGA Y HAD 2.25 MI (1 MI BASE AND 1 MI FINAL). ALL THAT WAS NEEDED WAS CGA Y TO CROSS THE THRESHOLD WITH UGA X PASSED THE INTXN (1500 FT). I ESTIMATE WITHOUT SENDING CGA Y AROUND THAT HE MIGHT HAVE HAD ABOUT 500 FT FROM THE INTXN. THIS OPERATIONAL ERROR HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED; AND AS THIS CTLR RETHINKS AND RETHINKS THIS ORDEAL OUT; THE SEVERAL COMPLICATIONS ARE BEING MADE INTO PERSONAL LESSONS FOR FUTURE EXPERIENCE.",,,,"OPERATOR ERROR NMAC.",

AFTER NOT SUCCEEDING; I WAS CONFUSED AND I TUNED 7700 AND TUNED INTO 121.5 AND COMMUNICATED; STARTING WITH XXX; THE PLANE IDENT AND THAT I WAS LOST AND TRYING TO GO BACK TO PRINCETON ARPT. THE PEOPLE ON 121.5 ASKED ME IF I HAD AN IDEA OF WHERE I WAS AND/OR IF THERE WERE ANY CHK POINTS TO USE AS REF; MY ANSWER WAS NEGATIVE. THE 121.5 PERSONNEL REQUESTED ME TO TUNE IN TO X XPONDER CODE; AND TO CHANGE TO THE MCGUIRE FREQ FOR VECTORS TO GO BACK TO PRINCETON ARPT. THE PEOPLE AT MCGUIRE ASKED ME FOR REF POINTS AND THE ONLY ONE I FOUND WAS A BIG HWY THAT WAS XING A BIG RIVER. I REQUESTED THEIR PERMISSION TO GET CLOSER TO THE BRIDGE TO IDENT ANY SIGNS IN THE BRIDGE AND ANY TOWN IN THE SURROUNDINGS. THEN I NOTICED THAT I WAS AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE DELAWARE TURNPIKE. I COMMUNICATED MY POS AND STARTED TO DO CIRCLES AROUND THE AREA TO MAINTAIN MY POS WHILE WAITING FOR VECTORS TO RETURN TO PRINCETON ARPT. AT THAT MOMENT; I MENTALLY FIGURED OUT THAT ALTHOUGH I HAD ENOUGH FUEL TO STAY IN THE AIR FOR A GOOD PERIOD OF TIME; FINDING AN ARPT WOULD BE THE BEST ALTERNATIVE TO LAND; CALL PRINCETON ARPT; PLAN MY TRIP BACK AND ADD FUEL IF NECESSARY. BESIDES; LNDG AND BEING AMONG MORE EXPERIENCED PEOPLE WOULD GIVE ME COMFORT. ONCE MCGUIRE GAVE ME INSTRUCTIONS ON HDG I LEFT THE AREA AND AFTER FLYING FOR SOME TIME I FOUND MYSELF IN AN AREA THAT WAS FAMILIAR . I REQUESTED MCGUIRE TO DO A TURN TO CHK IF PRINCETON ARPT WAS WHERE I HAD THE IMPRESSION IT WAS. DURING MY TURN; I FOUND AN ARPT THAT WAS NOT PRINCETON. NEITHER MCGUIRE NOR I COULD IDENT THE ARPT AT THAT TIME. THEN; I ASKED MCGUIRE FOR PERMISSION TO GET CLOSER TO THAT ARPT AND THE PERMISSION WAS APPROVED.AT THAT POINT I HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT EITHER MCGUIRE AND/OR 121.5 HAD INFORMED THE ARPTS IN THE AREA OF THE PROB AND THAT PROBABLY THE PERSONNEL AT THE ARPT WHERE I WAS WOULD RECOGNIZE THE CESSNA; OR THAT I HAD TUNED TO THE X CODE. I DID SOME CIRCLES AROUND THE ARPT TO CHK FOR THE ACTIVE RWY; PATTERN AND NUMBERS OF THE RWYS IN ORDER TO: HAVE ENOUGH INFO TO LAND IF IT WAS NECESSARY TO DO SO. GIVE ENOUGH TIME TO LET OTHER ACFT AND PEOPLE KNOW THAT I WAS AROUND SO THAT THEY WOULD NOTICE MY PRESENCE AND; USE THE RWYS' NUMBERS AS REF FOR MCGUIRE TO IDENT THE ARPT TO PLAN A RTE BACK TO PRINCETON ARPT IF I WAS CLOSE TO PRINCETON. I WAS ALSO EXPECTING TO READ THE NAME OF THE ARPT IN THE RWYS SINCE BEING ABLE TO READ THEM WILL ORIENT ME WITHOUT HAVING THE NEED TO LAND. MCGUIRE COULD NOT IDENT THE ARPT ONCE I GAVE THEM THE NUMBERS OF THE RWYS. I ASKED MCGUIRE PERMISSION TO LAND AND THEY APPROVED ME TO LAND AT THE UNKNOWN ARPT. THEN; I DID MY LNDG; I TAXIED MY PLANE AND STARTED TO LOOK FOR HELP. IT WAS SUNDAY AND SOME OF THE BUILDINGS WERE EMPTY; I LOOKED FOR A PHONE BUT I DID NOT FIND ANY. AFTER 15 MINS I FOUND SOMEBODY FROM SECURITY WHOM I TOLD ABOUT THE SIT AND THEN HE TOLD ME THAT I WAS AT TRENTON ARPT. THIS PERSON INFORMED THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ARPT OF THE EVENT. THEN I CALLED THE TWR AND ASKED THEM FOR HELP TO GO BACK TO PRINCETON ARPT. THE TWR AT TRENTON TOLD ME THAT THEY COULD NOT GIVE ME VECTORS BUT THEY SAID THAT HDG NE AFTER DEPARTING ON RWY 6 WILL LEAD ME TO PRINCETON ARPT. I FOLLOWED THEIR ORDERS; RECEIVED A CLRNC FOR TKOF AND ABOUT 4 MI FROM TRENTON THEY CAME BACK TO ME AND I INFORMED THEM THAT I HAD SEEN PRINCETON ARPT. I THANK THEM FOR THE HELP AND TOLD THEM THAT I WAS GOING TO SWITCH TO THE FREQ AT PRINCETON ARPT. ONCE NEAR PRINCETON ARPT; I ENTERED THE PATTERN AND LANDED THE PLANE.

THE FIRST OCCURRED AS STUDENT WAS DOING (TOUCH AND GO) ON RWY 9. HE WAS CLRED FOR THE OPTION RWY 9 WHILE ON L DOWNWIND RWY 9. AFTER HIS TOUCH AND GO (HE WAS INSTRUCTED TO PERFORM STOP AND GOES) PIE ATCT INSTRUCTED STUDENT TO ENTER A L DOWNWIND FOR RWY 22. STUDENT RESPONDED CORRECTLY TO ATC PER AIM AND HIS FLT TRAINING RADIO PROCS. INSTEAD OF TURNING L TO ENTER A L DOWNWIND FOR RWY 22; HE TURNS R TO MAKE A 270 DEG TURN; ENTERING A L MIDFIELD DOWNWIND 45 DEG ENTRY TO RWY 22. STUDENT'S ALT WAS 800 FT AGL; THE STANDARD TFC PATTERN ALT AT PIE. ATC MADE SEVERAL INQUIRIES; REQUESTING STUDENT'S INTENTIONS. WITH EACH ATC XMISSION THE CTLR BECAME MORE IRRITATED AT THE STUDENT'S ACTIONS BECAUSE OF THE DISRUPTIONS TO OTHER ACFT IN THE TFC PATTERN. NO MID-AIR INCIDENT OCCURRED HERE: YET; THE STUDENT'S CONFUSION; ATC'S IRRITATION; AND TFC SPACING HELP SET THE FIELD FOR THE NEXT INCIDENT MINS LATER. AS STUDENT FINALLY ESTABLISHED ON L DOWNWIND FOR RWY 22; PIE ATCT CLRS STUDENT TO LAND RWY 22; HOLD SHORT OF INTERSECTING RWY 17L FOR DEPARTING COAST GUARD C-130 TFC. STUDENT 'PARROTS' INSTRUCTIONS BACK PER HIS TRAINING. BECAUSE OF THE PREVIOUS COM PROB; ATC REPEATS CLRNC TO LAND AND HOLD SHORT 2 MORE TIMES. STUDENT REPEATS INSTRUCTIONS BACK TO ATC EACH TIME. UPON LNDG; STUDENT BEGINS A TKOF. ATC IMMEDIATELY INSTRUCTS HIM TO HOLD SHORT RWY 17L AND ABORT TKOF. STUDENT COMPLIED. ATC INSTRUCTED STUDENT TO TAXI CLR OF THE RWY AND TERMINATE FLT. ALTHOUGH THERE WERE 2 NEAR MISSES DURING THIS FLT; THE SECOND ONE WITH THE C-130 WAS MUCH CLOSER THAN THE STUDENT REALIZED. FROM INTERVIEWS WITH MY STUDENT AND ATCT CTLRS; HORIZ DISTANCE BTWN THE C-152 AND C-130 WAS ESTIMATED AT 300 FT AND VERT SEPARATION WAS 100 FT. SAFETY WAS COMPROMISED TWICE IN THE SAME FLT; BOTH INCIDENTS WITHIN MINS OF EACH OTHER. I FEEL THE FIRST INCIDENT HELPED CONTRIBUTE TO THE SECOND ONE; THROUGH THE STUDENT'S CONFUSION; ATC'S TERSE INSTRUCTIONS; THE STUDENT'S IMPEDED LANGUAGE SKILLS; AND TFC SPACING IN THE TFC PATTERN. ALSO; THE PRESSURE TO PERFORM WELL DEMANDED FROM HIS CULTURE WAS A SMALLER CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. THE LANGUAGE BARRIER IS THE PRIMARY REASON FOR BOTH NEAR- MISSES. THE STUDENT KNEW WHAT A HOLD SHORT CLRNC SOUNDED LIKE AND MEANT; AS ON ALMOST EVERY DUAL FLT A HOLD SHORT CLRNC IS ISSUED. THROUGHOUT HIS TRAINING; I HAVE HEAVILY EMPHASIZED RADIO COMS. SOMETIMES; ENOUGH IS NOT ENOUGH. STUDENT IS RECEIVING INTENSIVE REVIEW IN RADIO PROCS AND TFC PATTERN OPS AT CTLED AND UNCTLED ARPTS. HE IS LIMITED TO DUAL FLT UNTIL HIS SKILLS IN THESE AREAS SHOW COMPETENCY AND HIS CONFIDENCE IS RAISED.",,,,"FOREIGN STUDENT PLT FAILS TO FOLLOW TWR INSTRUCTIONS ON 2 OCCASIONS DURING SOLO TKOF AND LNDG PRACTICE CAUSED BY LANGUAGE BARRIER.

I NOTED THAT THE FIRST 1/3 OF THE RWY WAS SLOPED UPWARDS AND THAT THE SURFACE OF THE RWY WAS COVERED WITH THICK; WET GRASS. FROM THESE 2 THINGS; ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT THE DAY WAS COOL AND DRY AND SHOULD ALLOW FOR GOOD AIRPLANE TKOF PERFORMANCE; I FELT THAT 2/3 OF THE RWY WOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR TKOF. I CTRED THE AIRPLANE ON RWY 16; WENT THROUGH A PRE-TKOF CHK; HELD THE BRAKES AND APPLIED FULL PWR; CHKED FOR RPM OF 2500; MADE SURE EVERYTHING WAS WORKING PROPERLY; RELEASED THE BRAKES; AND BEGAN TO TAXI. DURING THE PRE- TKOF CHK; I APPLIED 10 DEGS OF FLAPS. I APPLIED FULL PWR; DID A CHK OF ENG RPM AND THE OTHER GAUGES. AS I TAXIED FORWARD; I PULLED BACK ON THE YOKE TO GET THE NOSE OFF THE GND. I NOTICED THAT THE RATE OF INCREASE OF THE AIRSPD WAS SLOW. I COULD FEEL THE AIRPLANE GETTING 'LIGHT' ON THE WHEELS BUT THE NOSE WHEEL WOULDN'T STAY OFF THE GND. I LOOKED TO MY R AND SAW THAT WE WERE ALMOST ABEAM THE WINDSOCK AND STILL AT ONLY ABOUT 50 KTS. DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME; PAST THE END OF THE RWY; WAS A STONE BUILDING WITH A FAIRLY LARGE ROCK NEXT TO IT. I DID NOT FEEL I HAD ENOUGH RWY OR AIRSPD TO CLR THAT BUILDING SO I ABORTED TKOF. I PULLED THE PWR TO IDLE AND ATTEMPTED TO SLOW THE PLANE WITH THE BRAKES. THE WHEELS BEGAN TO SKID. FROM THAT POINT ON MY ATTN WAS TOTALLY FOCUSED ON STAYING TO THE L OF THE BUILDING AND ROCK. THE PLANE SLID THROUGH THE END OF THE RWY; STRUCK A RIDGE WHICH PARTIALLY COLLAPSED THE NOSE GEAR; SLID ACROSS THE ARPT FACILITY'S DRIVEWAY; STRUCK A SMALL ROCK WHICH FINISHED OFF THE NOSE GEAR; AND SLID TO A STOP ABOUT 20-30 FT FARTHER DOWN. I FEEL THAT THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE INCIDENT WAS THAT I DIDN'T MAKE FULL USE OF THE RWY. MEASURING FROM THE AIRPLANE'S TRACKS SHOWED THAT I TOOK OFF ON ABOUT 1700 FT OF RWY -- I GAVE UP ABOUT 1000 FT. I WORKED OUT THE TKOF ROLL FROM THE CHART IN THE 152 OPS MANUAL; TAKING INTO ACCOUNT AS MANY OF THAT DAY'S CONDITIONS AS POSSIBLE. I CAME UP WITH 1245 FT TO CLR A 50 FT OBSTACLE. THE ONLY CONDITION THAT THE CHART COULDN'T MATHEMATICALLY ACCOUNT FOR WAS THE FACT THAT THE GRASS WAS WET. THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS BEING TAKEN ARE THESE: 1) 2 ADDITIONAL HRS OF INSTRUCTION AT A SOFT FIELD SIT. 2) A 1 HR CHK RIDE WITH THE CHIEF FLT INSTRUCTOR AT A LCL COLLEGE. 3) A CHK RIDE WITH AN FAA INSPECTOR TO EVALUATE SOFT FIELD OPS PERFORMANCE. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE DECISION TO ABORT THE TKOF WAS THE RIGHT ONE ALTHOUGH THE ENTIRE SIT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED WITH BETTER JUDGEMENTS PRIOR TO THAT.

I WENT ON MY FLT; SPENDING TIME ON APCHS; STALLS AND TURNS ABOUT A POINT. AFTER ABOUT 1.6 HRS OF FLYING TIME I DECIDED TO HEAD BACK. I HAD BEEN MONITORING MY FUEL AND BURN SEEMED TO COINCIDE WITH EXPECTED BURN (THE FUEL GAUGES READ BTWN 1/4 AND 1/2 TANK WHEN I DECIDED TO RETURN TO ARLINGTON ARPT -- APPROX 1/4 TANK PER HR). A COUPLE OF MI BEFORE REACHING THE ARPT THE ENG QUIT. I SET UP TO LAND IN THE ONLY AVAILABLE FIELD AND BEGAN TO ANALYZE THE CAUSE OF THE ENG FAILURE. SINCE THE FUEL GAUGES READ 1/4 TANK IN BOTH WINGS; I THOUGHT THAT THE CAUSE OF THE ENG FAILURE MAY HAVE BEEN CARB ICING (IT WAS IN THE UPPER 40'S OR LOW 50'S ON THE GND AND THERE WAS A THIN LAYER OF SCUD AT ABOUT 2500 FT); SO I TURNED THE CARB HEAT ON; WHICH CAUSED THE ENG TO SPUTTER MOMENTARILY BACK TO LIFE; BUT THEN IT QUIT AGAIN. I TURNED THE CARB HEAT OFF AND THEN TRIED TO LEAN OUT THE ENG THINKING THAT IT MUST HAVE FLOODED; WITH NO RESULT. I CHKED THE FUEL SHUTOFF VALVE TO ENSURE THAT IT WAS ON -- IT WAS. BY THE TIME I HAD GONE THROUGH ALL OF THIS; I WAS ON VERY SHORT FINAL TO THE CHOSEN FIELD. THE FIELD THAT I LANDED IN WAS COVERED WITH SMALL MESQUITE TREES; MOST OF WHICH WERE ONLY 3 OR 4 FT HIGH; BUT SOME WERE 6 OR 7 FT HIGH. ON THE LNDG ROLL IT WAS NECESSARY TO DRIVE BTWN 2 OF THE TALLER TREES. AFTER LNDG THE PLANE; I BROUGHT IT TO A STOP; CALLED F54 UNICOM TOLD THEM I WAS OK AND THE PLANE WAS OK AND TURNED OFF THE KEY AND THE MASTER SWITCH AND GOT OUT OF THE PLANE. THE TREES STRUCK THE WINGS AT THE OUTBOARD EDGES AND WRINKLED THE SKIN OF THE LEADING EDGES OF BOTH WINGS; BUT THE DAMAGE DID NOT SEEM SEVERE AT ALL. I CALLED FBO ON A CELLULAR PHONE AND TOLD THEM WHERE I WAS AND THAT THE PLANE WAS OK. WHILE I WAS WAITING; I LOOKED OVER THE OUTSIDE OF THE PLANE; CHKING THE OIL AND FUEL. AT THIS POINT I COULD STILL SEE FUEL IN THE TANKS; BUT IT LOOKED LOW. 3 PEOPLE WERE SENT OUT FROM FBO TO PICK UP THE PLANE. THEY INSPECTED IT AND DETERMINED THAT IT WAS LOW ON FUEL; BUT OTHERWISE FLYABLE. THEY TOOK ME BACK TO THE ARPT AND TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD GET IN TOUCH WITH ME LATER. LATER; THEY ADDED GAS AND FLEW IT BACK TO THE ARPT. ON DEC/XX/95; MR X THE OWNER; OF THE FBO CALLED AND SAID THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE ME. I WENT TO HIS OFFICE AND MET WITH 1 OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAD PICKED UP THE PLANE AND MR X. MR X INFORMED ME THAT WE COULD AVOID CALLING THE FAA IF I WOULD JUST PAY TO FIX THE PLANE; WHICH HAD SUSTAINED ONLY MINOR DAMAGE -- HE THOUGHT THAT IT COULD BE REPAIRED FOR APPROX $1500 -- ALTHOUGH HE HAD ESTIMATES AT BTWN $5000 AND $6000 (HE SAID THAT HE KNEW SOMEONE). AT THE MEETING HE ACCUSED ME OF RUNNING OUT OF FUEL FLYING 4.1 HRS IN A PLANE THAT HAS A RANGE OF 3 HRS. HE SHOWED ME PHOTOCOPIES OF THE 152 MANUAL WITH THE RANGE AND THE EMER PROCS HIGHLIGHTED (THIS INFO WAS NEW TO ME). THE RANGE WAS OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I HAD BEEN TOLD TO LEARN; ALTHOUGH THE EMER PROC WAS THE SAME. I HAD PERFORMED THE EMER PROC INCORRECTLY AS I WAS STILL TRYING TO RESTART THE ENG UNTIL I WAS WITHIN A FEW FT OF THE GND -- THINKING THAT I HAD GAS AND THAT MAYBE IT WAS CARB ICING AND THAT IT WOULD RESTART. I DID NOT CLOSE THE THROTTLE OR LEAN THE ENG OUT AFTER TRYING TO RESTART THE ENG AS I JUDGED I WAS TOO LOW TO DIVERT MY ATTN INSIDE AT THAT TIME. I STILL DO NOT KNOW THAT LACK OF FUEL CAUSED THE ENG FAILURE AS THE GAUGES READ 1/4 TANK; BUT IT WAS APPARENT TO ME THAT THE INSTRUCTION I RECEIVED WAS INCORRECT -- THE CESSNA 152 IS NOT JUST LIKE THE 150 -- AMONG OTHER THINGS ONE CAN FLY LONGER THAN THE OTHER. I WAS NEVER INFORMED TO ALWAYS START OUT WITH A FULL TANK OF GAS AND IN FACT WAS TOLD THAT; 'IN A CESSNA; IF YOU CAN SEE GAS IT IS FULL.' MY INSTRUCTOR AND I HAD GONE ON SEVERAL DUAL TRAINING FLTS WITH WHAT APPEARED TO ME TO BE LESS THAN A FULL TANK OF GAS. IN MY MIL ROTARY WING FLYING WE ALWAYS STARTED WITH A FULL TANK OF GAS; BUT WE HAVE NO WAY TO VERIFY THE FUEL LEVEL UNLESS IT IS FULL. SEVERAL FACTORS CAUSED THE INCIDENT TO OCCUR. FIRST; I WAS TAUGHT INCORRECTLY AND SECOND; THE FUEL GAUGES WERE INCORRECT AND THEY HAVE NO BACKUP SYS TO WARN OF LOW FUEL -- IT SEEMS THAT SUCH A SYS WOULD BE VERY INEXPENSIVE AND SIMPLE. IF THERE HAD BEEN SOME WAY OF DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF FUEL THAT WAS ACTUALLY IN THE TANK; OR IF THERE HAD BEEN A SECONDARY LOW FUEL WARNING SYS; OR IF THE TRAINING HAD BEEN MORE STANDARDIZED AND I BEEN ISSUED OR TOLD TO PURCHASE MANUAL FOR THE 152 AS WELL AS THE 150 THE INCIDENT WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED.",,,,"FUEL EXHAUSTION RESULTED IN A FORCED LNDG.",

I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT NO SUCH VIOLATION OF ANY FAR OCCURRED; BUT BECAUSE THE INCIDENT HAPPENED AS IT DID; IT COULD BE INTERPRETED THAT A VIOLATION HAD BEEN COMMITTED. IT IS FOR THIS REASON I SUBMIT THIS RPT. I HAD BEEN GIVING FLT INSTRUCTION TO A PRIMARY STUDENT IN TOUCH-AND-GO LNDGS WITH XWINDS. SPECIFICALLY; I WAS INSTRUCTING THE STUDENT IN THE XWIND LNDG TECHNIQUE OF SIDE-SLIP DURING LNDG TO COUNTER THE EFFECTS OF SIDEWAYS DRIFT FROM THE XWIND. I FLEW THE AIRPLANE DOWN THE FINAL APCH LEG AT NORMAL APCH SPD AND CONFIGN. I ESTIMATED THE WINDS TO BE 30-45 DEGS FROM THE R SIDE OF THE RWY AT 10- 12 KTS. I DID NOT REGARD THIS XWIND CONDITION TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO NEED THE USE OF LNDG WITH PARTIAL FLAPS. ENTERING THE LNDG FLARE AT NORMAL HT OVER THE RWY CTRLINE I DEMONSTRATED TO MY STUDENT THE EFFECT OF INSUFFICIENT BANK INTO THE XWIND BY HOLDING THE WINGS LEVEL. THE ACFT BEGAN TO DRIFT TO THE L. THEN I DEMONSTRATED HOW BANKING THE WINGS INTO THE XWIND AND USING OPPOSITE RUDDER TO PREVENT THE AIRPLANE FROM TURNING; WILL STOP THE AIRPLANE FROM DRIFTING TO THE L. THEN WITH A LITTLE MORE BANK ANGLE THE ACFT WOULD CORRECT BACK TOWARD THE CTR OF THE RWY. THESE I DEMONSTRATED WHILE GOING DOWN THE RWY IN GND EFFECT WITH PARTIAL PWR APPLIED. IT WAS WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO CORRECT THE ACFT BACK TO THE CTR OF THE RWY THAT THE ACFT STALLED AT A HT OF 4-5 FT IN MY ESTIMATION ABOVE THE RWY; AND BECAUSE OF THE XCTLED CONDITION AND THE BANK ANGLE TO THE R; THE R WING DROPPED AT THE MOMENT OF THE STALL AND BOTH THE R WHEEL AND R WINGTIP CONTACTED THE RWY AT THE SAME TIME. DAMAGE RESULTED ONLY TO THE WINGTIP. THE STALL WARNING HORN SOUNDED JUST PRIOR TO THE STALL. WHEN IT DID SOUND I APPLIED MORE PWR AND LOWERED THE NOSE SLIGHTLY. WHEN THE STALL OCCURRED I INSTANTLY LOWERED THE NOSE; APPLIED MORE PWR AND TRIED TO LEVEL THE WINGS. BUT IT HAPPENED SO QUICKLY IT ESSENTIALLY 'GOT AWAY FROM ME.' I KEPT THE ACFT UNDER DIRECTIONAL CTL; TAXIED OFF THE RWY AND INSPECTED THE ACFT. NO INJURIES RESULTED. THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED WHILE DEMONSTRATING PROPER CTL TECHNIQUES USING NORMAL MANEUVERS AND PROCS. MY MANEUVERS AND CTLS WERE CORRECT AND PROPER AND DONE IN A SAFE MANNER; UNFORTUNATELY MY AIRSPD CTL FAILED. ALTHOUGH MY REACTIONS WERE CORRECT THE STALL OCCURRED SO CLOSE TO THE RWY MY REACTIONS WERE NOT QUICK ENOUGH TO PREVENT THE HARD LNDG. ALTHOUGH MY ACTIONS RESULTED IN A STALL A FEW FT ABOVE THE RWY WHICH CAUSED A HARD LNDG AND DAMAGE TO THE WINGTIP I WAS NOT IN ANY WAY OPERATING THE ACFT IN AN UNSAFE; CARELESS OR RECKLESS MANNER. THE 2 FACTORS MOST RESPONSIBLE WERE AIRSPD CTL AND USE OF FULL FLAPS WHERE PARTIAL FLAPS WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. STEPS TO PREVENT A FURTHER OCCURRENCE OF THIS ACCIDENT; ARE FURTHER TRAINING AND AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF AIRSPD CTL IN THE LNDG PHASE AND USE OF ONLY PARTIAL FLAPS DURING XWIND LNDGS.",,,,"LNDG ACCIDENT.

I WAS NOT AT THE ARPT WHEN THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE; BUT FROM ANOTHER WITNESS'S ACCOUNT AND SPEAKING WITH THE STUDENT; I BELIEVE I HAVE PIECED TOGETHER WHAT HAPPENED. THE WIND WAS 190 DEGS AT 8-12 KTS AS HE MADE AN APCH TO RWY 25. HE SAID HE RECOGNIZED THAT HE HAD A BIT OF A XWIND AND AT ABOUT 20 FT AGL; PUT THE AIRPLANE IN A SLIP TO COMPENSATE. AT THIS TIME; HE ALSO HEARD THE STALL WARNING HORN AND ADDED SOME PWR. THIS IS WHEN HE DRIFTED ENOUGH TO STRIKE 2-3 RWY LIGHTS. THE CAUSE OF THE PROB WAS TWOFOLD. FIRST; HE SHOULD HAVE REACTED TO THE SLOW AIRSPD AND UNSTABLE SHORT FINAL WITH A GAR. THE OTHER PROB WAS THE RWY TO WHICH HE WAS MAKING HIS APCH. HE WAS GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE DEP THAT HE WAS TO USE RWYS MOST IN LINE WITH THE WIND. GIVEN THE WIND WAS 190 DEGS AND THAT THE BIL ARPT HAS A RWY 16; THIS WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM AN EASIER APCH AND LNDG. AS AN INSTRUCTOR; IT HAS HELPED ME TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF EMPHASIZING THE USE OF GARS AND THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF TRYING TO FORCE A LNDG FROM A BAD APCH. I BELIEVE IN DRILLING XWIND APCHS AND LNDGS.

I TOLD HIM TO ADD PRESSURE WITH HIS R HEEL TO MAKE THE ACFT TURN BACK TO THE R TO REALIGN WITH THE CTRLINE. I ADDED THE R RUDDER PRESSURE TO TAKE CARE OF THE SIT. I ADDED R BRAKE TO TIGHTEN THE TURN AS WE WERE GETTING CLOSE TO A PARKED BONANZA; A36. MY STUDENT HAD FROZEN ON THE L RUDDER WHEN HE SAW US GETTING CLOSER TO THE OTHER ACFT. I HAD LIMITED ABILITY IN OVERPOWERING HIM AND TURNING THE C152 R. I WAS CONCERNED THAT MY L WINGTIP WAS TOO CLOSE TO THE A36 PROP. WE WERE MOVING VERY SLOWLY AT THE TIME AND I ADDED EVEN BRAKING TO BRING THE C152 TO A FULL STOP. NOT SURE JUST HOW CLOSE MY WINGTIP WAS TO THE PROP; I MOVED FORWARD NOT MORE AND 1-2 INCHES. I MOVED SLOWLY AND GENTLY STOPPED THE C152; WHEN I FELT UNCOMFORTABLE PROCEEDING ANY FARTHER. I SHUTDOWN MY ACFT; GOT OUT; INSPECTED THE PROP AND INDEED; MY WINGTIP HAD SOFTLY BRUSHED THE PROP. I FOUND NOTHING MORE THAN A LITTLE DUSTING OF C152 WINGTIP PAINT THAT WIPED OFF THE PROP WITH MY FINGER. MY WINGTIP SHOWED A SMALL SCRATCH IN THE PAINT; AND WAS THOROUGHLY INTACT. I DETERMINED THE C152 TO BE AIRWORTHY; PUSHED IT AWAY FROM THE A36; GOT IN; STARTED UP; AND TAXIED. I DID NOT TAXI 100 FT WHEN THE GND CTLR CALLED. HE TOLD ME HE WAS SORRY BUT HE'D HAVE TO PUT THAT IN THE ARPT LOG. NOT KNOWING WHAT AN ARPT LOG WAS; AND SINCE NOTHING WAS DAMAGED; I DIDN'T PROTEST. I TOOK OFF WITH MY STUDENT. WE DID NOT FLY FARTHER THAN 15-20 MI FROM BEVERLY ARPT AND MONITORED THE TWR FREQ THE WHOLE TIME; AS IS STANDARD PRACTICE. I FELT THAT BY BEING WITHIN RANGE OF BEVERLY AND MONITORING TWR FREQ; I WAS ALERT AND AVAILABLE IN CASE ANYTHING CAME OF WHAT HAPPENED. UPON ARR ON THE RAMP AT PARKING; AFTER THE FLT; I PROMPTLY TOLD THE FLT SCHOOL OWNER/OPERATOR WHAT HAPPENED. BY IMMEDIATELY TELLING THE C152 OPERATOR; BY BEING AVAILABLE WHILE GIVING A LESSON; AND SINCE THERE WAS NO DAMAGE ANYWAY; I WAS BEING RESPONSIBLE. THE SCHOOL OWNER/OPERATOR HAD ALREADY BEEN CALLED BY BEVERLY TWR; AND HAD ALREADY GONE TO INSPECT THE A36. HE FOUND ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH THE PROP; AND AS WE TALKED; HE FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH MY WINGTIP. HE SENT A MECH TO INSPECT THE PROP ANYWAY. THE MECH FOUND NOTHING WRONG. THE BONANZA OWNER WAS NOTIFIED. THE OPERATOR WAS READY TO DISMISS THE WHOLE EVENT; BUT MENTIONED THAT THE TWR CTLR SAID I HAD COLLIDED WITH THE ACFT AND THE FAA WOULD BE NOTIFIED. UPON HEARING THAT; I BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CTLR; FROM 150 FT AWAY; HAD JUMPED TO CONCLUSIONS AND OVERREACTED. IN THE TWR CTLR'S RPT TO THE FAA; HE STATED THAT I 'COLLIDED' WITH THE BONANZA. WATCHING FROM 150 FT AWAY HE CANNOT BE SURE OF WHAT HE SAW. HE ASSUMED WHAT HE SAW; WITH A LITTLE IMAGINATION ADDED. IN HIS RPT HE IMPLIED THAT I GOT OUT OF THE ACFT; PUSHED THE C152 AWAY FROM THE BONANZA; GOT INTO THE C152 AND TAXIED AWAY. HIS RPT DOESN'T SAY THAT HE ALSO SAW ME INSPECT BOTH PROP AND WINGTIP BEFORE MOVING THE C152 AWAY. AFTER I GOT INTO THE C152 HE NEVER ASKED ANY QUESTIONS SUCH AS: 'WHAT HAPPENED?' 'IS EVERYTHING OKAY?' 'IS THERE ANY DAMAGE?' HE JUMPED OVER SEVERAL LAYERS OF INVESTIGATION AND MADE A DISHONEST RPT. HIS UNFOUNDED ACCUSATIONS AND IRRESPONSIBLE RPTING WITHOUT HAVING THE FACTS IS CAUSING DAYS; IF NOT WEEKS; OF HEADACHE FOR THE FLT SCHOOL; ALL FOR HIS 20 MINS OF GOVERNMENT GOODY-TWO-SHOES PAPER PUSHING. MANY AIR TFC CTLRS WANT TO PROVIDE A SVC; TO BE TRUSTED BY PLTS; AND TO HELP PLTS. THIS CTLR SAYS THAT HE WAS JUST DOING HIS JOB. HE HAS TO RPT SOMETHING IF HE SEE IT. I'VE KNOWN THIS CTLR'S VOICE AND ABILITIES FOR A LONG TIME. SINCE I'D ALWAYS THOUGHT I COULD TRUST HIM TO BE REASONABLE; HOW CAN I NOW TRUST ANY OF THEM? THERE IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN THE ATC SYS IF CTLRS ARE THERE TO HELP YOU; WITH YOUR PROBS OR THROUGH YOUR MISTAKES; BUT YET THEY ALSO HAVE OBLIGATION TO RPT YOUR PROBS OR MISTAKES TO FAA. PLTS ARE THUS ALWAYS ON EDGE AND CONFUSED AS TO HOW MUCH THEY CAN SAY TO GET THE HELP THEY NEED; BUT NOT GET VIOLATED. MOST COMMONLY; PLTS WON'T ASK FOR ASSISTANCE AND WILL FIND OTHER WAYS TO SOLVE THEIR PROBS.

I MADE A QUICK CALL IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS SAYING CESSNA ON SHORT FINAL ON RWY 33 MKT. HE PASSED ME APPARENTLY FROM ABOVE; SINKING BELOW ME FROM BEHIND; THEN UNDERNEATH. I SAW HIM COME OUT FROM UNDERNEATH AT A SPD APPROX 30 KTS FASTER THAN US. BY THE TIME I SAW HIM IT WAS TOO LATE TO TAKE ANY ACTION; IT WAS OVER. HE PASSED UNDERNEATH AT AN ALT OF APPROX 150 FT AGL. THE EVENTS THAT PUT US IN THIS SIT WERE HIS RADIO CALLS AND MYSELF TRYING TO STAY CLR. HE DID NOT ENTER THE PATTERN AND PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE AS WE ARE A BUSY ARPT.

I WAS PREPPING MY STUDENT FOR HSI PVT CHK RIDE AND HAD JUST FINISHED PRACTICING APCH AND DEP STALLS; STEEP TURNS; SLOW FLT; AND SIMULATED INST CONDITIONS. AT XB00Z AT AN ALT OF 3000 FT MSL (2000 FT AGL); I PULLED THE PWR TO SIMULATE AN EMER ENG OUT; FOR WHICH MY STUDENT WAS TO MAKE A SIMULATED EMER LNDG. MY STUDENT CHOSE A FIELD APPROX 5 MI SW OF OAK GROVE; AR. AS WE STARTED OUR DSCNT; I ASKED HIM TO POINT OUT THE FIELD TO ME. I LOOKED FOR STRUCTURES; VEHICLES; VESSELS; AND PEOPLE; TO MY DETERMINATION WE WERE AT LEAST 500 FT AWAY FROM ANY AS PER FAR 91.119. SOON AFTER MY STUDENT STARTED THE GAR; WE HIT 2 PWR LINES; WHICH WE HAD NOT SEEN. ONE OF THE LINES HIT THE EXHAUST AND CRIMPED IT SHUT. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; WE LOST PWR; BUT NOT IMMEDIATELY. IMMEDIATELY AFTER IMPACTING THE LINE; I TOLD MY STUDENT THAT I HAD CTL OF THE ACFT. DURING THE SHORT TIME DURING WHICH WE STILL HAD PWR; WE GAINED A COUPLE HUNDRED FT IN ALT. AS WE LOST PWR; I HAD TO LOWER THE NOSE TO MAINTAIN THE AIRSPD. I CHOSE A FIELD PARALLELING THE ONE WE WERE JUST OVER AND SET IT DOWN IN A FARMER'S FIELD; UPON LNDG; THE BRAKES WERE APPLIED; BUT BECAUSE OF DAMP GRASS AND MUD; WE SLID A SHORT DISTANCE. THE AIRPLANE WENT THROUGH A SECTION OF BARBED WIRE AND CAME TO REST AT A CATTLE TROUGH. DAMAGE TO THE AIRPLANE WAS TO THE L WINGTIP; THE PROP; L SIDE OF THE FUSELAGE NEAR THE HORIZ STABILIZER; L HORIZ STABILIZER L ELEVATOR; AND THE BOTTOM OF THE RUDDER. I AM AWARE OF 91.119; AND WHEN WE MAKE THE DSCNT; WE WERE CLR OF ANY STRUCTURES; VEHICLES; OR PEOPLE. THE CONTRIBUTING FACTOR WOULD BE MY POOR JUDGEMENT IN ALLOWING MY STUDENT TO GO THAT LOW. I DID SO FOR 2 REASONS. FIRST; I WANTED TO MAKE THE SIMULATED LNDG AS REAL AS POSSIBLE; AND TEACH MY STUDENT AS BEST I COULD. SECOND; I WAS PREPARING MY STUDENT FOR HIS PVT CHK RIDE AND THE EXAMINER HE WAS GOING TO RIDE WITH OFTEN TAKES STUDENTS FAIRLY LOW TO THE GND. I WANTED HIM TO BE PREPARED FOR THIS. THIS EVENT HAS BEEN A REAL LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR ME; AND I DON'T WANT IT TO HAPPEN AGAIN. PERSONALLY; I WILL IN THE FUTURE ABANDON SIMULATED ENG OUTS AT AN ALT OF 500 FT AGL TO AVOID ANY UNSEEN STRUCTURES OR OBSTACLES. AND WHEN I WANT TO GO LOWER I WILL DO SO ONLY AT AN ARPT WHERE THE STUDENT CAN GO ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE GND. I HAVE ALREADY PASSED ON WHAT I HAVE LEARNED TO OTHER INSTRUCTORS AT THIS FLT SCHOOL; AND TO MY STUDENTS AS WELL. THE POLICY OF THIS FLT SCHOOL REGARDING DUAL INSTRUCTION SIMULATED ENG OUTS WAS THE FLT INSTRUCTOR CAN GO AS LOW AS HE DEEMS NECESSARY. THIS POLICY WILL BE CHANGED AS A RESULT OF THIS ACCIDENT. I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO BE SAFE AND TO TEACH SAFETY; AND THIS ACCIDENT HAS REALLY IMPRESSED ON ME THAT IMPORTANCE. AFTER HITTING THE PWR LINE; I THINK MY REACTION WAS QUICK AND EFFICIENT. BUT THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO HAPPEN IF WE HADN'T HAVE BEEN THAT LOW. THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN IS TO IMPRESS ON MY STUDENTS THE NEED FOR CONSTANT AWARENESS OF STRUCTURES; OBSTRUCTIONS AND OTHER ACFT. I THINK THE WINGS PROGRAM IS HELPFUL ALSO IN GETTING ACROSS THE NECESSITY OF INCREASED AWARENESS AND AVIATION SAFETY. ONE FACTOR THAT HELPED THIS PWR LINE STRIKE TURN OUT WITH NO INJURIES IS THE FACT THAT I STAY UP ON MY MANEUVERS; PRACTICING THEM DAILY. THIS IS ONE FACTOR THAT NEEDS TO BE STRESSED TO PLTS IS THE NEED TO PRACTICE SAFETY MANEUVERS BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU WILL BE DOING IT FOR REAL; AND DURING THESE TIMES PROFICIENCY IS NEEDED; YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO BE RUSTY. I AM REALLY THANKFUL THAT THERE WERE NO INJURIES.",,,,"INSTRUCTOR WITH SPI HITS WIRES ON PRACTICE EMER LNDG. MAKES EMER LNDG IN FIELD AFTER ENG FAILS.",

BUT I ARRIVED LATE FROM A PREVIOUS FLT WITH ANOTHER STUDENT. THE NEXT STUDENT WAS IN A HURRY FOR A TENNIS LESSON AT XA00. I KNEW WE WOULD ONLY HAVE ENOUGH TIME FOR A 1 1/2 HR FLT. THE LESSON WOULD ONLY TAKE AN HR OR A LITTLE MORE. I SPOKE TO PLT WHO FLEW THE AIRPLANE BEFORE US. HE SAID THEY HAD FLOWN TO MUI AND BACK. THE FLT WAS 2.3 HRS. MY STUDENT PREFLTED THE ACFT AND SAID EVERYTHING WAS OK. I ASKED HIM HOW MUCH OIL AND FUEL WAS ON BOARD. HE SAID 5 QUARTS OF OIL AND LITTLE LOW ON FUEL. I CHKED THE AIRPLANE'S FLT LOG TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH FUEL WAS ONBOARD. THE FLT LOG STATED THE AIRPLANE HAD FLOWN 2.3 HRS AND HAD BEEN FUELED BEFORE THE FLT TO MUI. I TURNED THE MASTER SWITCH ON TO CHK THE GAUGES. THE GAUGES READ BTWN 3/4 AND 1/2 TANK ON BOTH FUEL CELLS. I THEN VISUALLY CHKED THE FUEL CELLS ON TOP OF THE WINGS. I COULD SEE FUEL AND I PHYSICALLY TOUCHED IT WITH MY FINGERS. I HAD BEEN TAUGHT; I TEACH; AND I HAVE USED A RULE OF THUMB; THAT IS; IF YOU TOUCH THE FUEL YOU ROUGHLY HAVE 1/2 TANK OR A LITTLE LESS. WE WERE PRACTICING MANEUVERS FOR ABOUT 35-40 MINS WHEN THE ENG BEGAN RUNNING ROUGH. I IMMEDIATELY TOOK CTL OF THE ACFT AND STARTED GOING THROUGH PROCS TO MAKE THE ENG RUN SMOOTHLY. I HAD EXPERIENCED PROBS WITH THE CARB AND MAGNETOS BEFORE AND IT FELT LIKE THE SAME PROB. THE PROCS SEEMED TO TAKE CARE OF THE ROUGHNESS AND I RETURNED THE AIRPLANE TO THE STUDENT. IN THE PROCESS OF GOING THROUGH THE PROCS; I HAD TURNED TOWARDS THE ARPT. AT THE TIME OF THE PROBS; WE WERE AT 2500 FT AND ABOUT 5-7 MI FROM THE ARPT. THE STUDENT STARTED FLYING AWAY FROM THE ARPT TO SET UP FOR AN ENTRY INTO THE TFC PATTERN. WHEN THE ROUGHNESS RECURRED; I AGAIN TOOK CTL OF THE ACFT AND STARTED FLYING DIRECTLY TOWARD THE FIELD. WE WERE LOSING PWR AND ALT AS WE HEADED TOWARD THE FIELD. I WAS TRYING TO MAINTAIN PWR AND ALT BUT WE WERE DSNDING. THE ARPT WAS IN SIGHT AND I THOUGHT I COULD MAKE THE RWY OR TXWY. AS WE WERE GETTING CLOSER; I REALIZED I WAS NOT GOING TO MAKE THE RWY. I DECIDED TO PICK THE TXWY TO LAND. WE WERE STILL HDG TOWARD THE ARPT AND DSNDING. I REALIZED I WAS NOT GOING TO MAKE TXWY. I DECIDED I COULD NOT MAKE THE FIELD AND TURNED TOWARDS A BIG ROAD BY THE ARPT. THE DECISION I MADE WAS THE HARDEST DECISION I HAVE EVER MADE. I WANTED TO MAKE THE ARPT SO BADLY. BUT IT WAS EITHER PUT THE AIRPLANE INTO HOUSES; TRY TO HOLD ALT AND MAKE THE FIELD WHICH COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A STALL; OR PICK THE SAFEST PLACE I COULD PUT THE AIRPLANE DOWN. OVER THE ROAD WERE MANY PWR LINES; HWY SIGNS; AND STOPLIGHTS. THERE WERE SO MANY TIMES I WANTED TO PUT THE AIRPLANE DOWN. BUT I COULDN'T BECAUSE OF THE OBSTRUCTIONS. I FINALLY PUT THE AIRPLANE DOWN ON THE ROAD SAFELY. THERE WERE NO INJURIES TO US; ANYBODY ON THE GND; AND THE AIRPLANE WAS NOT DAMAGED. I LEARNED THE RULE OF THUMB I USE IS NOT A GOOD WAY TO CHK THE FUEL. I KNOW IT IS NOT RELIABLE AND I WILL NEVER TEACH IT OR USE IT AGAIN. I LEARNED A VERY PWRFUL LESSON. THIS LESSON I LEARNED I CAN CARRY TO STUDENTS AND ANY PLT. NO ONE SHOULD GO THROUGH WHAT I DID. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR HAD A HEARING WITH THE LCL FSDO.

THE AIR WAS SMOOTH. ABOUT 40 MINS INTO THE FLT AT ABOUT 20 MI S OF READING; THERE WAS A SINGLE EVENT OF SEVERE TURB. THE ACFT ABRUPTLY SKEWED SIDEWAYS AND FELL ABOUT 200 FT. THIS WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A THUMPING SOUND WHICH I ATTRIBUTED TO 'OIL-CANNING' OF THE ALUMINUM AIRFRAME. IN MY OPINION; THE EVENT WAS NOT SO ROUGH AS TO INDUCE STRUCTURAL DAMAGE. ALL ENG GAUGES PERFORMED NORMALLY. HOWEVER; WITHIN A FEW MINS; I NOTICE BOTH FUEL GAUGES WERE READING EMPTY. I HAD JUST TOPPED BOTH TANKS AT HAGERSTOWN PRIOR TO THIS FLT. THE ACFT CARRIES 36 GALS OF FUEL YIELDING 4 HRS AT 75 PERCENT PWR AT TYPICAL CRUISING ALTS (4000-8000 FT). SINCE I WAS ALREADY IN CONTACT WITH READING APCH; I INFORMED THEM OF MY CONDITION WITHOUT DECLARING AN EMER. READING ASKED ME IF I WISHED TO CONTINUE INBOUND OR DIVERT TO THE NEAREST ARPT. I REQUESTED THE NEAREST ARPT WHICH WAS MORGANTOWN; PA; A GRASS STRIP PRIMARILY USED FOR GLIDER OPS. READING GAVE ME A VECTOR OF ABOUT 7 MI E WHICH WAS CONFIRMED BY MY GPS 'NEAREST ARPT FUNCTION.' AS I DSNDED TO MORGANTOWN FOR LNDG; AN OBSERVER ON THE GND WITH A HAND-HELD TRANSCEIVER ADVISED ME I WAS TRAILING 'SMOKE.' THE LNDG AT MORGANTOWN WAS WITHOUT INCIDENT AND AN OVERHEAD ACFT ASKED MY STATUS TO RELAY TO READING APCH CTL. AFTER SHUTTING DOWN AND INSPECTING THE ACFT; I FOUND THE R-HAND FUEL TANK CAP WAS OFF THE FILLER NECK AND CAPTIVE ONLY BY ITS SAFETY CHAIN. THIS CAP IS AN APPROVED VENTED FUEL CAP FOR THE ACFT. THE RPTED 'SMOKE' WAS ATOMIZED GASOLINE TRAILING FROM THE OPEN TANK. APPARENTLY; THE SOUND I HAD HEARD DURING THE TURB WAS THE FUEL CAP COMING OFF AND HITTING THE WING. I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED THE CAP TO CONTINUE TO MAKE BANGING SOUNDS BUT IT HAD NOT. JUST PRIOR TO TKOF AT HAGERSTOWN; I HAD PERSONALLY SECURED BOTH FUEL CAPS. HOWEVER; AT MORGANTOWN; I DID NOTICE THE R-HAND CAP SEEMED A BIT LOOSER FIT WHEN REPLACED ON THE FILLER NECK. THERE ARE 2 METAL RETAINING EARS ON THE CAP WHICH MAY BE SLIGHTLY BENT TO TIGHTEN THE FRICTION LOCKING ACTION OF THE CAP. AFTER LNDG AT MORGANTOWN; THERE WAS ONLY A TOTAL OF 12 GALS OF FUEL REMAINING. THE L TANK HAD FED THROUGH TO THE SIPHONING R TANK. SINCE I HAD USED ABOUT 9 GALS OF FUEL IN FLT; SOME 15 GALS HAD SIPHONED AWAY IN ONLY A FEW MINS. ACCORDINGLY; I BELIEVE TOTAL FUEL EXHAUSTION WOULD HAVE OCCURRED BEFORE REACHING READING. LNDG AT MORGANTOWN WAS DEFINITELY THE RIGHT CHOICE. THE LESSON LEARNED HERE IS TO BE MORE VIGILANT OF OBSERVING FUEL QUANTITY EVEN DURING A VERY SHORT FLT WITH OSTENSIBLY FULL TANKS. WHEN I HEARD THE 'THUMP' SOUND; I CHKED ALL ENG GAUGES BUT DID NOT IMMEDIATELY CHK THE FUEL GAUGES. IT WAS SEVERAL MINS LATER WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT THE FUEL GAUGES AND BY THEN; ALMOST ALL THE FUEL WAS GONE. MY MECH HAS EXAMINED THE FUEL CAP AND HAS DETERMINED IT TO BE AIRWORTHY. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING: RPTR STATES THE ACFT WAS A CESSNA 170B. HIS BEST GUESS REGARDING THE PROB IS THAT THE HORIZ DISPLACEMENT OF THE ACFT IN THE TURB MAY HAVE CAUSED THE RAISED PORTION OF THE CAP; WHICH IS SOMEWHAT LIKE A SMALL SAIL; TO BE TURNED BY THE WIND AND POP OFF. THE REASON HE HEARD ONLY 1 BANG WAS PROBABLY DUE TO THE FACT THEY WERE AT CRUISE AND FORWARD MOTION KEPT THE CAP DIRECTLY BEHIND THE FUEL TANK ENTRANCE. HE FUELED THE ACFT HIMSELF AND KNOWS THAT HE PLACED BOTH CAPS ON PROPERLY. THE ONLY OTHER EXPLANATION HE CAN COME UP WITH IS THE 'EARS' MENTIONED IN THE NARRATIVE. ALL IN ALL A VERY STRANGE EXPERIENCE.",,,,"C170B HAS GAS CAP COME LOOSE IN FLT RESULTING IN GAS SIPHONING. EMER LNDG.",

I WAS ORDERED BY THE CTLR TO TURN IMMEDIATELY TO XWIND AND FROM THAT POINT ON; THE FLT CONTINUED WITHOUT ANY INCIDENTS.

FUTURE ACTIONS -- WHAT WAS LEARNED: WHILE HOLDING SHORT ALWAYS STAND THE PLANE IN (HIGH WING) A 45 DEG RELATIVE BEARING TO THE RWY; SO YOU CAN SCAN THE TFC PATTERN WITHOUT INTERFERENCE; ESPECIALLY THE FINAL APCH. ALWAYS REPEAT THE CLRNCS GIVEN AND ANNOUNCE YOUR FUTURE ACTIONS BEFORE DOING THEM. BE ALERT FOR CLRNC GIVEN FOR OTHER PLANES IN AIR AND ON THE GND; ESPECIALLY IF THEY CARRY A SIMILAR IDENT NUMBER.

I HAD SET A GOAL OF GETTING MY INST LICENSE BEFORE SCHOOL STARTED AGAIN FOR THE FALL QUARTER. WELL; SCHOOL STARTED AGAIN ON SEP/YY/95. THE ONLY THING I NEEDED TO GET MY INST RATING WAS XCOUNTRY TIME.

WE CONTINUED OUR STRAIGHT AND LEVEL FLT TO THE NE; TO CLR THE AREA BEING USED BY THE PITTS. ABOUT 5 MINS LATER THE PITTS SHOT UP FROM BELOW US; AND JOINED US IN LOOSE FORMATION SLIGHTLY BEHIND US AND TO THE R. IT WAS APPROX 200-300 FT AWAY. THERE WAS NO COM AND NO HAZARD TO EITHER ACFT; AS THE PITTS CRUISED ALONGSIDE FOR 20 OR 30 SECONDS; THEN 'PEELED AWAY' UP AND TO THE R. MY REASONS FOR RPTING ARE SEVERAL. FIRST; WE ARE SEEING INCREASED AEROBATIC ACTIVITY LIKE THIS IN CONGESTED AREAS. THE AEROBATIC MANEUVERING PROBABLY SHOULD NOT OCCUR IN A HVY STUDENT TRAINING AREA LIKE THIS; AS AN E152 COULD NOT EASILY EVADE A FAST AEROBATIC AIRPLANE MANEUVERING OVER SEVERAL MI. SECONDLY; IT IS INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS TO JOIN A NON PARTICIPATING ACFT IN FORMATION. IF WE HAD NOT SEEN THE ACFT BEHIND AND TO OUR R (AT ABOUT 4 O'CLOCK POS) AND HAD ROLLED INTO A R TURN; A COLLISION WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE RESULTED. FINALLY; THERE IS AN AEROBATIC BOX 'SEVERAL' (THERE ARE NO DIMENSIONS - AFSS) MI NW OF WHERE THIS INTERACTION OCCURRED. PERHAPS THE PITTS PLT THOUGHT THAT HE OR SHE WAS IN THE BOX; OR HAD DRIFTED OUT OF IT; WHILE MANEUVERING. IN ANY CASE; THE RISK OF SUCH ENCOUNTERS WOULD BE GREATLY REDUCED IF AEROBATIC BOXES WERE MARKED ON THE SECTIONAL AND CLASS B TERMINAL CHARTS. CURRENT DISSEMINATION OF AEROBATIC BOX INFO IS JUST TOO INACCESSIBLE; AND LOCATIONS ARE TOO HARD TO VISUALIZE. THE PITTS PLT WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THERE IS AN AEROBATIC BOX AND USED IT (HOPEFULLY). OTHER PLTS LESS FAMILIAR WITH THE LCL AREA THAN MYSELF; INCLUDING STUDENT PLTS; COULD SEE THE BOX ON THE MAP; AND AVOID IT (WHEN APPROPRIATE).

WE THEN TAXIED BACK TO THE FLT SCHOOL; AND WAITED MORE THAN 30 MINS; WAITING FOR THE POLICE WHO NEVER SHOWED UP. AFTER THAT TIME; WE LEFT FOR HOME. WHAT CAUSED THE PROB: THE PROB WAS CAUSED DUE TO PEOPLE BEING OUTSIDE; SEEING THE AIRPLANE FLYING AROUND WITH AN ENG NOISE LOW AT THE BEGINNING AND THEN HIGH WITH VARIOUS CHANGES OF PWR SETTING. THE PROB IS THAT WE WERE AT PROX OF THIS HOUSING COMPOUND; AND THAT WE CAUSED A DISTURBANCE TO THESE PEOPLE WHO MAY BE ALREADY TIRED OF NOISE DISTURBANCE DUE TO THE INTENSE TFC NEAR GRAND PRARIE AND ARLINGTON ARPTS.

WHILE DEPARTING IN A R 270 DEG TURN; CLBING THROUGH 1800 FT; APPROX 5 MI SE OF HWD; THE ENG LOST PWR. THE ENG WAS GENERATING APPROX 1/2 PWR. I CHKED THAT THE THROTTLE WAS FULL ON; BOTH MAGNETOS ON; MASTER ON; PRIMER IN AND LOCKED; FUEL SHUTOFF IN 'ON' POS. I PUMPED THE THROTTLE; THEN PULLED THE CARB HEAT ON. SQUAWKED 7700 AND ADVISED HWD TERMINAL. I LANDED AFTER SHUTTING THE ENG OFF ON FINAL. I TURNED OFF THE FUEL SHUTOFF; OPENED THE DOORS. AS THE PLANE TOUCHED DOWN AND SLOWED ON THE ROLLOUT; THE NOSE GEAR BROKE OFF; AND THE TIP OF THE R WING HIT A TREE LIMB. THE HOBBS METER INDICATED 2.4 HRS OF TOTAL TIME FOR THE FLT. IMMEDIATE INSPECTION BY LAW ENFORCEMENT ON SCENE VERIFIED FUEL IN THE TANKS AND GASALATOR. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF WATER CONTAMINATION. A VISUAL ESTIMATE OF BOTH FUEL TANKS APPEARED 1/3 FULL IN EACH TANK. AFTER THE INITIAL PWR LOSS; THE ENG CONTINUED TO RUN. IT WAS NOT SURGING; NOR WAS IT BACKFIRING. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR STATED THE PROB WITH THE ENG HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED. THE ENG LOST PWR AT ABOUT 1300-1500 FT AGL HE ESTIMATED. THE POS OF THE FAA IS THAT THE RPTR RAN OUT OF FUEL. IN ANSWER TO THE FACT THERE WAS ABOUT 8 GALLONS OF FUEL ON BOARD WAS; THERE ARE 'WALK UP' SVC STATIONS IN THE AREA. THIS WAS IN SPITE OF THE FACT AN FAA DESIGNATED EXAMINER WHO ARRIVED IN A RESCUE HELI JUST AFTER THE FORCED LNDG TO ASSIST IN THE EVENT OF INJURIES DETERMINED THERE WAS ABOUT 8 GALLONS OF FUEL IN THE TANKS. THE RPTR STATED THERE WAS VERY LITTLE DAMAGE TO THE AIRPLANE. THE PROP HAD STOPPED AT THE 3 O'CLOCK POS AS HE SIDE-SLIPPED INTO THE LNDG AREA. THERE WAS NO PROP DAMAGE OR SUDDEN ENG STOPPAGE. THE RPTR HAD SHUT THE ENG DOWN WHEN HE EXHAUSTED EVERY ATTEMPT TO RESTORE ADEQUATE PWR TO SUSTAIN FLT.

CALLED BACK AROUND XC15; CEILINGS HAD LIFTED TO 12500 FT; AND SAME WAS EXPECTED IN BOSTON; AND THAT SOME LOWER LEVEL BROKEN/SCATTERED LAYERS COULD BE EXPECTED ALONG THE RTE. WAS PLANNING TO FLY AT 7500 FT TO GET PLENTY OF CLRNC OVER MOUNTAINS IN EASTERN NEW YORK TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE TURB PROBS. TRIP WENT AS PLANNED UNTIL WE REACHED THE CHESTER VOR; WHEN THE CLOUD LAYER BELOW US STARTED TO GET A LITTLE THICKER. CONTINUED FLT BECAUSE I DID NOT EXPECT THE CLOUDS TO LAST LONG; AS THE FORECAST FOR BOSTON HAD BEEN GOOD JUST 1 1/2 HRS PRIOR TO THAT. AFTER GOING FURTHER; COULD SEE THAT CLOUD LAYER DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DIMINISHING. TOLD BRADLEY ATC THAT IT LOOKED LIKE WE WERE GOING TO BE STUCK VFR ON TOP. THEY ACKNOWLEDGED AND HANDED OFF TO ZBW. ZBW ASKED ME TO HEAD TO LAWRENCE; WHERE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS STILL CLR. ENRTE; THEY SAID LAWRENCE WAS COVERED; BUT MANCHESTER WAS STILL CLR. ENRTE; THEY SAID MANCHESTER WAS COVERED; AND WERE CHKING THE AREA FOR ANY ARPT THAT WAS CLR. EVENTUALLY WE WERE N OF LOGAN; AND THEY SAID HARTFORD WAS STILL RPTING A BROKEN 2500 FT CEILING AND ASKED IF WE COULD MAKE IT THERE. THEY ALSO ASKED ABOUT FUEL ONBOARD. BY THE TIME THEY HAD DECIDED HARTFORD MIGHT BE OKAY; WE WERE DOWN TO ABOUT 1.75 HRS OF FUEL REMAINING. ABOUT THEN; GOT HANDED OFF TO A LONE CTLR; X; DON'T RECALL HIS LAST NAME; EVEN THOUGH I TALKED TO HIM AFTER LNDG LATER; WHO ALSO DID SOME MORE WX CHKING AND KEPT ME OUT OF THE WAY OF ARRIVING AND DEPARTING LOGAN TFC; WHICH WE COULD SEE GOING INTO AND OUT OF THE CLOUDS. X ASKED ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE. I TOLD HIM I HAD ABOUT 140-150 HRS (I THINK HE WAS RELIEVED I WASN'T A STUDENT PLT). HE ASKED IF I WAS IFR RATED (NO) AND IF THE PLANE WAS IFR EQUIPPED (YES). HE ASKED IF I WOULD BE COMFORTABLE BEING TALKED DOWN THROUGH THE CLOUDS; SINCE THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY OPENINGS ANY PLACE. HE DIDN'T SAY THIS; BUT I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT HARTFORD MIGHT BE COVERED BY THE TIME WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THERE. I TOLD HIM I HAD SOME RECENT BASIC IFR TRAINING; 3-4 HRS; OF JUST BASIC INST FLT; AND I THOUGHT I COULD DO IT; SINCE IT WAS JUST GOING TO BE A WINGS LEVEL DSCNT. X HAD ME COME DOWN TO JUST OVER THE CLOUDS; AND THEN I SET IT UP FOR A 500 FPM DSCNT; TURNED ON THE PITOT HEAT AND CARB HEAT; AND DROPPED DOWN INTO THE CLOUDS. ABOUT 4 MINS LATER WE CAME OUT NE OF BEVERLY AROUND 3000 FT. I CONTINUED DOWN TO 2500 FT TO GET BETTER VISIBILITY; AND X HAD ME FOLLOW THE COAST S TOWARDS BEVERLY AND HAD ME CONTACT BEVERLY TWR; WHERE WE HAD AN UNEVENTFUL LNDG. AFTER THE LNDG; I CALLED ZBW AND MORE OR LESS GAVE THEM THIS SAME INFO OVER THE PHONE. DURING THE FLT I KEPT TRACK OF WHERE I WAS BY USING THE VOR AND SWITCHING BTWN VOR STATIONS TO TRIANGULATE A POS. I ALSO USED THIS PROC TO GET HEADINGS TO FLY WHEN TRYING TO GET TO LAWRENCE AND LATER MANCHESTER. I HAD ALSO BEEN USING THE VOR TO TRACK FROM THE CHESTER VOR WHEN TRYING TO GET TO MARLBORO. LESSONS LEARNED: CALL AHEAD TO FLIGHT WATCH SOONER WHILE IN FLT WHEN CONDITIONS START LOOKING DIFFERENT THAN FORECASTED (I THINK I DELAYED DOING THIS WHILE TALKING TO BRADLEY ATC BECAUSE THEY WERE SO BUSY IT WAS TOUGH TO BREAK IN TO ASK FOR FREQ CHANGE APPROVAL. ONLY HAVE 1 RADIO IN THIS PLANE); EXPECT MORE CLOUDS WHEN THE ALTIMETER SETTINGS/PRESSURE STARTS DROPPING; AND GET DOWN UNDER THEM SOONER.

MY FRIEND WAS ALONG TO ACT AS A SAFETY PLT. I NEEDED TO GET CURRENT AND THE INST PRACTICE IS GOOD FOR ME. WE BOTH PERFORMED THE PREFLT INSPECTION. WE CONFIRMED THE ELAPSED START TIME PRIOR TO DEP. ADDITIONALLY; WE VISUALLY CHKED THE FUEL TO CONFIRM THE TANKS WERE TOPPED AND THAT WE WERE DEPARTING WITH THE FULL 24.5 GALS USABLE. THIS ACFT BURNS APPROX 6 GALS PER HR. MY FRIEND (PNF) WAS ACTING AS THE SAFETY PLT FOR ME. MY FRIEND IS A 200 HR PVT PLT READY TO TAKE HIS INST CHK RIDE. I HAVE FLOWN AND INSTRUCTED HIM FOR OVER 40 HRS AND TRUSTED HIS CAPABILITIES. I WANTED TO GET AND REMAIN INST CURRENT AND USED PORTIONS OF THE FLT FOR THE INST CURRENCY PRACTICE. WE HAD A MUTUAL AGREEMENT THAT THE SAFETY PLT WOULD BE THE PIC WHILE THE OTHER IS UNDER THE HOOD. AT APPROX 1 HR INTO THE FLT I ASKED MY FRIEND TO LOOK IN THE RENTAL BOOK AND FIND THE START TIME. I HAVE FLOWN CLOSE TO 40 HRS WITH THIS FRIEND AND TRUSTED HIS CAPABILITIES TO LOOK IN A BOOK AND GET THE TIME. MY FRIEND TOLD ME THAT THE START TIME WAS 5.5. HE TOOK 5.5 AND ADDED 3 HRS TO IT AND PLANNED TO DEPART THE AREA TO RETURN TO THE ARPT AT 8.5 ON THE HOBBS (TIME METER). HE COUNTED THE TICKS AND AT 8.5 ON THE HOBBS DEPARTED FOR THE ARPT. AS WE CROSSED OVER THE TOP OF THE ARPT THE CTLR SAID TO DSND TO PATTERN ALT AND START A DOWNWIND TO RWY 17. AS I WAS TURNING L BASE TO FINAL RWY 17 I NOTICED THAT THE ENG PWR BEGAN TO SURGE FROM HIGH TO LOW. I POINTED THE NOSE AT THE ARPT AND ATTAINED EMER DSCNT SPD. I PUSHED THE MIXTURE RICH AND PULLED THE CARB HEAT ON. THE PROB CONTINUED AND BEGAN TO GET WORSE. I TOLD THE CTL TWR THAT I HAD A PROB. I THEN VERIFIED THAT GAS WAS ON; MIXTURE RICH AND CARB HEAT ON; AND PRIMER LOCKED AND MAGNETOS ON BOTH; THROTTLE FULL PWR. I THOUGHT THAT I HAD BLOWN A JUG BECAUSE I KNEW I HAD ENOUGH FUEL ON BOARD. I SHOULD LAND WITH 1/2 HR OF FUEL ON BOARD. I THEN GLANCED AT THE FUEL GAUGES. I NOTED THAT THEY LOOKED VERY CLOSE TO EMPTY. AT THIS POINT I THOUGHT IT COULD BE FUEL STARVATION. I WONDERED IF THE HOBBS TIME THAT MY FRIEND GAVE ME WAS CORRECT. I WAS STILL PLAYING WITH THE THROTTLE AND FOUND BY PURE CHANCE THAT WHEN THE THROTTLE WAS ADVANCED THAT THE ENG WOULD GIVE A SURGE OF PWR. I BEGAN TO PUMP THE THROTTLE WHICH DID GIVE ME ADDITIONAL PWR. I THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE IT TO THE RWY. I CONTINUED TO PUMP THE THROTTLE UNTIL IT NO LONGER SEEMED TO HELP. I WAS ABOUT 200 FT SHORT OF THE RWY AND A DIRT ROAD WHICH RAN THE PERIMETER OF THE ARPT WAS IN REACH. I LANDED ON THE DIRT ROAD. THE ACFT SUSTAINED NO DAMAGE NOR DID MY FRIEND OR I. UPON LNDG AND STOPPING THE ACFT THE ENG WAS STILL RUNNING. I CALLED THE CTL TWR AND RPTED THAT WE WERE DOWN AND ON THE PERIMETER ROAD. THEY ASKED IF I COULD GET TO A TXWY. I REPLIED YES AND I BEGAN TO TAXI TO A TXWY. WE STOPPED ON THE TXWY AND WAITED FOR ARPT POLICE; WHILE WAITING I WANTED TO CHK HOW LONG WE HAD FLOWN; I ASKED MY FRIEND FOR THE RENTAL BOOK. I LOOKED INSIDE AND FOUND THE HOBBS START WAS 4.8 NOT 5.5 AS MY FRIEND TOLD ME PRIOR. WE HAD FLOWN .7 LONGER THAN I PLANNED. ARPT POLICE MET ME AT THE TXWY. I SHUT THE ENG DOWN. I GAVE THEM MY INFO. THEY ASKED IF I NEEDED ANY FURTHER ASSISTANCE. I SAID 'NO;' THEY ALLOWED ME TO TAXI AWAY. I STARTED THE ENG AND PROCEEDED TO THE HANGAR. I THEN RAN THE ENG UP TO SEE IF I COULD REPLICATE THE PROB. I COULD NOT. I THEN LOGGED IN THE DISCREPANCY LOG 'ROUGH ENG; SEEMED LIKE THE MAGNETOS' DATED DEC/XX/95. THE PROB OCCURRED BECAUSE I ALLOWED A PLT OTHER THAN MYSELF TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINDING THE HOBBS TIME. I TRUSTED MY FRIEND WHEN I SHOULD HAVE NOT. I SHOULD HAVE LOOKED IN THE BOOK MYSELF. THE PROB COULD HAVE FURTHER BEEN AVOIDED BY USING MORE THAN 1 DEVICE TO DETERMINE THE TIME IN FLT. HOWEVER; THE ONLY REASON WE DID NOT LAND OFF THE FIELD IS BECAUSE I DID FOLLOW THE 1/2 HR RESERVE REQUIREMENT. I AM PRETTY SURE THAT THIS WAS FUEL STARVATION. ALL THE INDICATIONS POINT TO THIS; BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE ENG WAS RUNNING ON THEGND AFTER LNDG. ANOTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IS THAT I USUALLY FLY AN AIRPLANE WITH A TIMER IN IT AND THIS DAY I WAS IN A DIFFERENT AIRPLANE. I ALSO FORGOT MY WATCH. I ALSO WAS ANGERED ABOUT SLC LNDG PROCS. WHEN YOU COME IN TO LAND THEY MAKE YOU DSND AND DRAG YOU OUT AWAY FROM THE ARPT. IF THEY WOULD ALLOW A DSCNT AND LET YOU REMAIN CLOSE TO THE ARPT THEN WE WOULD HAVE LANDED ON THE RWY WITHOUT A PROB.",,,,"SMALL ACFT PLT; RELYING ON OBSERVER PLT TO COMPUTE PROPER FUEL TIME.

WHILE ON DOWNWIND APPROX 3 MI NE OF THE APCH END OF RWY 21; THE TWR RPTED THE LEARJET AT 11 O'CLOCK; FROM OUR POS. AGAIN; WE NEVER MADE VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE LEARJET; AND SO; WE CONTINUED DOWNWIND. WE WERE UNABLE TO CONTACT THE TWR; DUE TO HVY RADIO CONGESTION TO LET HIM KNOW WE DID NOT SEE THE LEARJET. WE CALLED THE TWR 7 MI OUT TO NOTIFY HIM WE WERE TURNING BASE; THE TWR NEVER REPLIED. APPROX 6 MI OUT I MADE ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO REACH THE TWR; TO NOTIFY HIM THAT I WAS ON FINAL. AGAIN; THE TWR DID NOT REPLY. DURING THE TIME WE CONTINUED OUR DOWNWIND; AFTER NOT MAKING VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE LEARJET; THE TWR TURNED A FEW AIRPLANES; IN FRONT OF US FOR BASE ENTRY. AT ABOUT 4-5 MI OUT ON FINAL; I CALLED THE TWR AGAIN; AND HE TOLD ME TO MAKE A L 360 DEG TURN. AS I WAS MAKING MY 360 DEG TURN; WITH NO MORE THAN A 30 DEG BANK; THE TWR CALLED TFC AT 12 O'CLOCK POS. AT THIS POINT; I WAS ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF THE WAY THROUGH MY 360 DEG TURN. I RPTED THAT I HAD 2 TARGETS ON THE N DOWNWIND THAT COULD OF POSSIBLY BEEN THE TFC HE WAS CALLING. I DO NOT KNOW. THE TWR TOLD ME TO FOLLOW A CHEROKEE IN FRONT OF ME ON FINAL. I RPTED BACK AND REPEATED THAT I WOULD FOLLOW THE CHEROKEE. I HEARD THE TWR MAKE A CALL TO THE TFC BEHIND ME; WHICH WAS A LOW WING ACFT. TWR TOLD THE MOONEY; TO FOLLOW THE CESSNA 1 MI AHEAD. THE MOONEY RPTED THAT HE DID NOT HAVE THE TFC; BECAUSE THE SUN WAS IN HIS EYES. AT APPROX 2.5 MI OUT; 40 SECONDS AFTER THE TWR MADE THE LAST CALL TO THE MOONEY; I NOTICED THE MOONEY DSNDING THROUGH MY ALT; OVER ME AND A LITTLE TO THE L OF ME. I DID NOT TAKE EVASIVE ACTION; FOR THE MOONEY WAS MUCH FASTER THAN I; AND WAS STILL HIGHER. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE TWR; AND PROCEEDED TO RPT THE MOONEY; DSNDING IN FRONT OF ME AND OVERTAKING ME. THE TWR TOLD THE MOONEY TO GAR. I WAS THEN CLRED TO LAND; AND LANDED UNEVENTFULLY. I BELIEVE SOME OF THE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO BE: 1) HIGH TFC VOLUME; AND MUCH RADIO CONGESTION. 2) THE MOONEY; DID NOT SEE THE TFC 1 MI AHEAD; WAS APPROX TWICE MY SPD; HAD HIS GEAR UP; AND DID NOT THINK TO SLOW DOWN; OR DO S-TURNS TO FIND HIS TFC. HE DID NOT DETERMINE THAT I WAS A HIGH WING ACFT; AND HE A LOW WING; THAT I WAS MUCH SLOWER THAN HIM. 3) AT THE TIME OF THE OCCURRENCE; I WAS INDICATING 85 KTS; THE MOONEY WAS HIGHER THAN I; AND MAYBE INDICATING 120-140 KTS. I FEEL SOME THINGS CAN BE DONE TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE: 1) ON A VERY CLR SAT AND/OR SUN; WITH CALM WINDS AND NO CEILING; IT SHOULD BE APPARENT TO THE SANTA MONICA TWR; THAT THE PROBABILITY OF HIGH TFC WILL MOST LIKELY OCCUR. DUE TO THIS TFC AND RADIO CONGESTION; THE TWR SHOULD NOT ALLOW TFC INTO THE CLASS D AIRSPACE; UNTIL THEY KNOW FOR SURE THAT THEY CAN HANDLE THE AMOUNT OF TFC. 2) THE TWR COULD HAVE TOLD THE MOONEY TO STAY CLR OF THE CLASS D AIRSPACE; AND CIRCLE OVER DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES; WHICH IS APPROX 10 MI NE OF THE ARPT. THAT IS WHERE THE MOONEY MADE HIS INITIAL CALL; AND THE TWR TOLD HIM TO STANDBY. 3) ON HIGH DENSITY DAYS AT SANTA MONICA; IT MAY BE A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE ANOTHER CTLR IN THE TWR OVERSEEING THE JOB OF THE CTLR ON THE TWR FREQ; IN CASE THE WORKLOAD BECOMES OUT-OF-CTL. 4) LOW-WING AND HIGH-WING ACFT; NEED TO BE EXTRA AWARE OF EACH OTHER; ESPECIALLY AT CRITICAL TIMES; IE; LNDG CONFIGN. 5) FAST ACFT MUST BE AWARE THAT IF THEY ARE FOLLOWING A SLOW ACFT WHICH THEY CANNOT SEE IN THE TFC PATTERN; THEY MUST SLOW DOWN AND DO S-TURNS FOR SPACING. THEY MUST DO SOMETHING TO FIND THEIR TFC.",,,,"INSTRUCTOR WITH STUDENT PLT IN TFC PATTERN; ON FINAL ARE OVERTAKEN BY A MOONEY RESULTING IN NMAC.",

THE VIOLATION WAS MADE OVER CUPERTINO; CA; ON A 1 HR FLT OUT OF SJC ON SATURDAY. A BRIEF STATEMENT WAS TAKEN FROM ME BY THE 'ARPT OPS MGR' AT SJC. THIS STATEMENT WAS TAKEN BEFORE I ACCURATELY AND COMPLETELY 'REALIZED' WHAT I HAD REALLY DONE. I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLAIN MY POS ON THIS ISSUE AND EXTEND MY SINCEREST APOLOGY FOR THE UNNECESSARY AND UNINTENTIONAL VIOLATION. PRIOR TO THE VIOLATION; MORE SPECIFICALLY; ON MAR/FRI/96; I HAD JUST RECEIVED MY SOLO ENDORSEMENT AFTER COMPLETING FLT '10' ON MY PART 141 FLT TRAINING CURRICULUM. THE NEXT DAY TURNED OUT TO BE AN IDEAL DAY FOR FLYING SO I DECIDED TO EXERCISE MY NEWFOUND PRIVILEGE OF SOLO FLT. I PLANNED TO FLY TO THE LEXINGTON RESERVOIR PRACTICE AREA TO PRACTICE SOME ELEMENTARY MANEUVERS. AFTER LEXINGTON I DECIDED TO FLY OVER MY LIFELONG HOMETOWN; CUPERTINO. AT THIS POINT I WAS MAINTAINING PROPER ALT. THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE FLT; MY FIRST SOLO FLT AWAY FROM THE ARPT; I WAS ATTEMPTING TO PAY UTMOST ATTN TO ALL DETAILS OF THE FLT. QUITE FRANKLY; I WAS VERY EXCITED TO BE FLYING AS PIC OF AN ACFT FOR THE FIRST TIME; ALONE. MY ATTN TO THE FLT AND ACFT WERE OCCUPYING MY ENTIRE THOUGHT PROCESS. WHILE FLYING OVER CUPERTINO; I NOTICED THE HOUSE OF A GOOD FRIEND. WHILE CIRCLING AND OBSERVING THIS HOUSE MY FRIEND AND HIS FATHER EXITED THE HOUSE AND BEGAN WAVING TO ME. I WAS VERY ENTHUSED AND PROUD TO BE NOTICED SO I CONTINUED TO CIRCLE FOR 2 MINS. AFTER THIS TIME; I DECIDED TO PROCEED BACK TO SJC TO LAND. WHEN I LOOKED AT MY INSTS TO ESTABLISH A CRUISE CLB; I NOTICED MY ALT. I HAD BEEN SLOWLY DSNDING WHILE CIRCLING WHICH I HAD NOT REALIZED. WHEN I NOTICED MY LOW ALT; MORE SPECIFICALLY 800 FT; I IMMEDIATELY ESTABLISHED A CLB TO REGAIN PROPER ALT AND RETURN TO THE ARPT. AT THE TIME I DISCOVERED MY LOW ALT; I WAS WORRIED ABOUT BEING TOO LOW; AND WAS HAPPY TO REGAIN PROPER ALT. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT KIND OF RESPONSE I HAD GOTTEN FROM SPECTATORS ON THE GND UNTIL I LANDED. AFTER DISCOVERING THAT MANY PEOPLE HAD CALLED 911 AND COMPLAINED; I FELT ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE AND ASHAMED. I DID NOT INTEND TO DISTURB; HARASS; OR UPSET ANYONE AND I FEEL EXTREMELY EMBARRASSED; ASHAMED; AND WORRIED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. I SPOKE WITH AN FAA PRINCIPAL OPS INSPECTOR. AN ADDITION HE SUGGESTED MAKING IN MY STATEMENT WAS TO EXPLAIN THE EMPHASIS PUT ON MINIMUM ALTS IN MY PRIOR FLT INSTRUCTION. THE 1000 FT MINIMUM ALT OVER A POPULATED AREA RULE HAS APPEARED OCCASIONALLY IN MY INSTRUCTION BOTH VERBALLY AND IN MY TEXTBOOKS. I HAVE BEEN ASKED; ON QUIZZES; AND VERBALLY; IN THE PAST; WHAT THE MINIMUM ALT REQUIREMENT OVER A POPULATED AREA WAS; IN WHICH I ANSWERED CORRECTLY; ALONG WITH MANY OTHER QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO ALL ASPECTS OF FLYING. I HAVE NOT BEEN INSTRUCTED IN THE PAST ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS OR WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE IF AN FAR IS VIOLATED; NOR WAS ANY EXTRA EMPHASIS PUT ON THE MINIMUM ALT RULE. IN MY PRIOR INSTRUCTION; ALL FAR RELATED ISSUES WERE EMPHASIZED SIMILARLY. I HAVE OBTAINED A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP OF THE PART OF CUPERTINO THAT I WAS FLYING OVER; TO ILLUSTRATE EXACTLY WHERE I WAS FLYING. AS NOTED ON THE MAP; THE GND ALT OF THE EXACT AREA I WAS CIRCLING RANGED FROM 360 FT TO 380 FT ABOVE SEA LEVEL. THE LOWEST READING THAT I OBSERVED ON MY ALTIMETER WAS 800 FT. AS NOTED; AT THAT POINT I IMMEDIATELY INITIATED A CLB AND PROCEEDED BACK TO THE ARPT. AN ADDITIONAL FACT TO NOTE IS THAT MY ALTIMETER WAS SET TO THE CURRENT ATIS AT SJC WHEN I TOOK OFF. IN CONCLUSION; AFTER CALCULATING THESE FIGURES YOU CAN SEE THAT I WAS NO LESS THAN 420 FT AGL WHILE FLYING OVER CUPERTINO. ONCE AGAIN; I AM EXTENDING MY SINCEREST APOLOGY AND REGRET TO WHAT I HAVE DONE. I AM CLASSIFYING THIS INCIDENT AS POSSIBLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSONS LEARNED IN MY ENTIRE FLYING CAREER.",,,,"SPI ON FIRST FLT AWAY FROM ARPT MAKES LOW ALT FLT OVER HOMES.",

I ASKED THE TANKS TO BE TOPPED OFF. AS THE DISPATCHER LEFT; SHE ADVISED ME THERE WAS AN ACTUAL VOLUME OF 30 GALS OF FUEL. DURING THE PREFLT; I CHKED THE TANKS THAT NIGHT WITH MY FLASHLIGHT AND SAW THE FUEL WAS JUST BELOW THE TABS. I ESTIMATED THEN MORE THAN 20 GALS OF FUEL. I CHKED THE GAUGES; BATTERY ON; ENG OFF; AND SAW THEY INDICATED MORE THAN HALF FULL WHICH CONFIRMED MY CHK OF THE TANKS. THE ROUND TRIP WAS A 2 HR FLT; AND BASED ON A 6 GPH CONSUMPTION; I ESTIMATED I HAD MORE THAN 2 HRS AND 45 MINS REQUIRED. REACHING 3300 FT MSL ON MY WAY BACK FROM PALOMAR TO MONTGOMERY; THE ENG STARTED TO RUN ROUGH. I CHKED THE GAUGES. THEY WERE READING NEARLY '0.' I IMMEDIATELY APPLIED MIXTURE HIGH; THROTTLE FULL FORWARD; CARB HEAT ON; BUT THE ENG KEPT RUNNING ROUGH. I RPTED MY EMER SIT TO SOCAL APCH AND ASKED THEM TO TRACK ME TO A SAFE AREA. THEY GAVE A HDG OF 010 DEGS. AT THIS TIME THE ENG STOPPED. I TRIED TO START IT; MAGNETOS ON BOTH. IT DIDN'T. AT A GLIDING SPD OF 66 KTS I LOOKED FOR A SAFE LNDG AREA; AND ADVISED THE CTLR I WAS GOING TO LAND ON A ROAD ALONG A LAKE S OF PALOMAR ARPT; WHICH APPEARED TO ME NOT OVERCROWDED. ON THE ROUNDOUT; THE R WINGTIP HIT A TREE AND THE AIRPLANE SPINNED TO THE R AND CRASHED. AFTER THE CRASH I DISCOVERED THAT THE DISPATCHER WAS WRONG ABOUT THE FUEL QUANTITY; AND THAT THE FUEL GAUGES HAD SHOWED HIGHER THAN THE ACTUAL FUEL AMOUNT. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 332086: THE PIC AND I TOOK OFF AFTER HAVING TAKEN A WX RPT BY PHONE; AND CHKED THE PLANE. I LEFT THE PLT CHKING THE GAS; HE ESTIMATED BY A VISUAL CHK WE HAD OVER 20 GALS AND IT WAS CONFIRMED BY GAUGES READING MORE THAN HALF FULL. AFTER DEPARTING FROM PALOMAR ARPT; THE ENG STARTED TO SLOW DOWN; HE CHKED THE GAUGES AND SAW THEY READ ZERO. HE DID THE EMER PROCS AS THE ENG KEPT GOING ROUGH. HE CONTACTED SOCAL APCH AND ASKED FOR RADAR VECTORING. TAKING THE ADVISED BEARING TO PALOMAR AIRFIELD; THE ENG STOPPED. HE TRIED TO START IT BUT IT WAS HOPELESS. I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO LAND ON THE HIGHWAY; BUT THE PLT PREFERRED A SMALLER ROAD ON THE R; WHICH WAS FAR LESS CROWDED; PREFERRING TO AVOID A CAR CRASH AS WELL. WE WERE PREPARED TO CRASH; AND I HELPED HIM AS MUCH AS I COULD; BY TELLING HIM THE OBSTACLES I COULD SEE. AT ABOUT 3 FT ABOVE THE ROAD; WE HIT A TREE OR SOMETHING ELSE WITH THE R WING; THAT SPUN THE PLANE. WE HIT THE GND BY THE L; AND THEN SLIPPED ON THE SIDE. WE POPPED OUT OF THE PLANE AFTER SWITCHING OFF EVERYTHING AND WAITED FOR HELP TO COME. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR ACN 332086 REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR HAD NEVER FLOWN AT NIGHT WHICH IS WHY HE REQUESTED A NIGHT DEMONSTRATION FLT. HE STATES THAT A SERIES OF FAILURES LED TO A FORCED LNDG. THE FLT WAS ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED TO BE IN ANOTHER ACFT (IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE OTHER ACFT DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE FUEL FOR THE FLT AND THE ARPT FUEL TRUCK WAS EMPTY). THE ACFT INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT WAS SAID TO HAVE ENOUGH FUEL; WHICH RPTR INDICATES IMPAIRED THE PLT'S JUDGEMENT. THE PLT CHKED THE FUEL ON THE LONG RANGE TANKS IN THE C152 AND WAS NOT REALLY ABLE TO ESTIMATE ACCURATELY. RPTR STATES THAT TWICE OR THREE TIMES DURING THE FLT HE TOLD THE PIC THAT THE FUEL GAUGES APPEARED TO INDICATE EMPTY; BUT THE PLT DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE HAZARD. AT THE TIME THE HOBBS STOPPED; THE ACFT HAD BEEN IN FLT FOR 1.9 HRS.

AFTER DOING SEVERAL TOUCH AND GOES; THE 'INCIDENT' OCCURRED WHEN WE MADE A TOUCH AND GO AND ON THE NEXT DOWNWIND TWR TOLD US THAT WE HAD BEEN CLRED TO LAND; HE'D CALL OUR DEP. WE NEVER HEARD THIS XMISSION AND POSTFLT DISCUSSION WITH THE CTLR REVEALED HE ATTEMPTED TO CALL US 3-4 TIMES. HE SAID HE KNEW WE DID NOT ANSWER; WE DIDN'T ANSWER BECAUSE WE DID NOT HEAR THE CALL. THE HAZARD WAS THAT A FALCON JET WAS DEPARTING ON RWY 14; NECESSITATING OUR FULL STOP. SINCE WE DID NOT FULL STOP; OUR DEP PATHS WERE CONFLICTING AND THE FALCON HAD TO MAKE A HARD L TURN OUT. I REALIZE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO 'KEEP EARS OPEN' AT TWR ARPTS HOWEVER; UNRELIABLE AVIONICS (OLD ORIGINAL RADIOS) AND THE ACTIVITY OF FLT INSTRUCTING (IT'S USUALLY EASIEST TO DISCUSS THE PREVIOUS LNDG WITH A STUDENT ON DOWNWIND) MAY HAVE CONFLICTED WHEN TWR WAS ATTEMPTING TO CONTACT US. DURING THE FLT; WE WERE VIGILANT IN RESPONDING TO ALL OUR CALLS THAT WE HAD RECEIVED. SINCE TWR KNEW THAT WE DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR RADIO CALLS; PERHAPS RWY 14 TFC SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELD ON THE GND LONGER TO ASSURE PROPER SEPARATION. IN THE FUTURE; I WILL BE EVEN MORE VIGILANT IN LISTENING FOR RADIO CALLS AND WISHING THE ACFT WAS EQUIPPED WITH BETTER QUALITY AVIONICS. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR STATES THE ACFT WAS A C152. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SUCH A THING HAS HAPPENED TO HIM PERSONALLY. THERE IS A VERY ACTIVE FLT SCHOOL AT THE ARPT AND ATC WILL OCCASIONALLY REQUEST FULL STOP WHEN TFC GETS BUSY. THE FALCON IS A MIL ACFT THAT WAS ALSO DOING TRAINING.

AFTER PREFLTING THE ACFT AND STARTING THE ENG; I INSTRUCTED MY STUDENT TO TUNE IN THE ATIS. WE HAD NO PROB RECEIVING THE ATIS LOUD AND CLR AND MY STUDENT RECORDED THE INFO ONTO HIS NOTE PAD. HE THEN TUNED IN THE GULFPORT GND CTL FREQ FOR OUR CLRNC TO TAXI. AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS (AT LEAST 5); I TOOK THE MIKE AND ATTEMPTED GND CTL MYSELF SEVERAL TIMES. FAILING TO REACH ANYONE ON THAT FREQ; I PROCEEDED TO INFORM MY STUDENT THAT SOMETIMES WHEN ATC OPS ARE SLOW; BOTH GND AND TWR ARE CTLED ON TWR FREQ. THEREFORE; I THEN TUNED IN THE TWR FREQ AND AGAIN ATTEMPTED TO RECEIVE A CLRNC TO TAXI SEVERAL TIMES WITH NO SUCCESS. ASSUMING ATC WAS NOT YET IN OP AND HEARING NO OTHER TFC ON THE TWR OR GND FREQ; WE PROCEEDED TO TAXI TO RWY 36. UPON ARRIVING TO RWY 36 WE FINISHED THE PREFLT AND DID THE ENG RUN-UP. AGAIN I TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO CONTACT THE TWR. I THEN EXPLAINED TO MY STUDENT THAT WITH THE TWR NOT IN OP YET; WE WOULD RPT ALL OF OUR INTENTIONS ON THE CTAF (SAME AS TWR FREQ). WE THEN ANNOUNCED OVER THE CTAF THAT WE WERE TAKING OFF ON RWY 36. ONCE AIRBORNE; WE RPTED OUR INTENTIONS OF L CLOSED TFC AND TOUCH AND GOES; ANNOUNCING EACH LEG IN THE PATTERN. WE COMPLETED THE FIRST TOUCH AND GO AND WERE ENTERING THE DOWNWIND LEG WHEN I HEARD TWR XMIT; 'ACFT CALLING GULFPORT; WHERE HAVE YOU DEPARTED FROM?' WE THEN REPLIED THAT WE HAD JUST DEPARTED GULFPORT ARPT. HE THEN REPEATED THE QUESTION ABOUT 4 MORE TIMES OBVIOUSLY NOT RECEIVING OUR XMISSIONS. AT THIS TIME; I BELIEVED THAT THERE MIGHT BE A PROB WITH THE RADIOS AND LOOKED FOR LIGHT SIGNALS FROM TWR -- I SAW NONE. THE NEXT THING THE TWR XMITTED WAS 'ACFT IN THE PATTERN; CLRED TO LAND RWY 36.' I ACKNOWLEDGED HIS XMISSION; NOT KNOWING IF HE RECEIVED ME OR NOT; AND PROCEEDED TO LAND ON RWY 36. AFTER LNDG; THE TWR INSTRUCTED US TO TAXI TO THE RAMP AND CALL THE TWR. I TRIED TO CONTACT TWR UPON REACHING THE RAMP; BUT GOT NO RESPONSE. I THEN CALLED UP TWR FROM ANOTHER AIRPLANE ON THE RAMP.

THE CESSNA 152 WHICH I WAS PIC; WAS DOING TOUCH AND GOES ON RWY 25R WITH A PRE-SOLO STUDENT. THIS WAS THE STUDENT'S THIRD LESSON IN THE TFC PATTERN. LESSON ONE WAS ALMOST ALL HANDS-ON BY THE INSTRUCTOR. THE STUDENT LEARNED THE LEGS OF THE PATTERN; PROCS AND AIRSPDS. THE INSTRUCTOR DID ALL LNDGS. THE STUDENT HAD NEVER PERFORMED A TOTALLY UNASSISTED LNDG IN TRAINING THUS FAR. IN LESSON TWO THE STUDENT WAS ALLOWED CTL OF THE ACFT DOWN TO 300 FT; AND TOWARD THE END OF THE SESSION WAS ALLOWED TO LIGHTLY COME ON THE CTLS (YOKE).

AT DOWNWIND ABEAM TWR; CTLR TOLD CESSNA TO EXTEND DOWNWIND TO 605 FREEWAY BEFORE BASE AND CLRED TO LAND; HOLD SHORT RWY 30. I REPLIED 'HOLD SHORT RWY 30.' THE CTLR NEVER SAID WHY WE WERE BEING EXTENDED. ON OTHER OCCASIONS I HAVE BEEN TOLD WHY ALTHOUGH I KNOW IT IS NOT A REQUIREMENT. ABOUT 1/2 MI FROM 605 FREEWAY; CTLR SAID; 'CESSNA TURN BASE; CLRED TO LAND.' I REPLIED;' CLRED TO LAND.' I MADE BAD JUDGEMENT CALL AND ASSUMED BECAUSE THE CTLR NO LONGER SAID 'HOLD SHORT RWY 30' AND TURNED US IN EARLY THAT THE SIT FOR CONFLICT WAS RESOLVED AND I PREPARED FOR A TOUCH AND GO. I HAD JUST DONE FOUR TOUCH AND GOES AND NEVER ASKED FOR A FULL STOP. I FEEL SAFETY WOULD BE BETTER SERVED IF CTLRS AT LONG BEACH USED THE WORDS 'FULL STOP' MORE OFTEN. MY STUDENT MADE A GOOD APCH. AFTER TOUCHDOWN; INSTRUCTOR GAVE ACFT TO STUDENT; INSTRUCTOR CALLED FOR FULL PWR AND THE STUDENT COMPLIED. THE ACFT STARTED DRIFTING TO THE L AND I QUICKLY TOOK CTLS AND CALCULATED FLYING SPD WHILE CORRECTING. I CALCULATED TO BE IN THE AIR BEFORE DRIFTING OFF RWY. JUST AS I DETERMINED TO LIFT OFF; THE CTLR SAID; 'CESSNA; HOLD SHORT OF RWY 30.' I LOOKED OUT THE FRONT WINDOW (REMEMBER I AM AT A L 10-20 DEG ANGLE) AND SAW THE FRONT END OF A STOPPED B737 ABOUT 500 FT AWAY. I IMMEDIATELY DID WHAT I PLANNED TO DO ALL ALONG; LIFT-OFF AND CORRECT FOR RWY ALIGNMENT. NOW I WAS CLBING AWAY STRAIGHT DOWN A CLR RWY 25R WITH A B737 STOPPED AT MY 10 O'CLOCK POS. CTLR SAYS 'CESSNA HOLD SHORT OF RWY 30' I LOOKED AND CALCULATED AND DETERMINED IF I WERE TO TAKE OFF ALL PWR; I WOULD FLY RIGHT INTO RWY 30 AND TOUCH DOWN IN THE CTR; AND BY THE TIME I COULD STOP THE PLANE; I WOULD BE AT LEAST 100 FT PAST THE INTXN; MAKE A U-TURN AND BE MORE OF A HINDERANCE.

BEFORE I COULD ACKNOWLEDGE THIS ALERT; I SAW A CESSNA 425 ACFT PASS OVER MY ACFT; APPROX 50 FT DIRECTLY ABOVE ME. I WAS ABLE TO OBSERVE THIS BECAUSE MY ACFT WAS EQUIPPED WITH OVERHEAD SKYLIGHT WINDOWS. THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE TIME TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION. THIS WAS CAUSED BY SEVERAL FACTORS. WX WAS MARGINAL VFR (1400 FT BROKEN; VISIBILITY 10 MI). LCL TWR CTLR WAS DISTRACTED BY OTHER TOUCH AND GO PATTERN TFC. THE ACFT THAT ALMOST HIT ME (CESSNA 425) WAS ON THE VOR 25 APCH TO OXNARD; CA. THIS APCH USES THE CAMARILLO VOR; AND ACFT OVERFLY CAMARILLO ON THIS APCH. THIS APCH MANDATES AN ALT OF 1700 FT MSL UNTIL PASSING THE CMA VOR. AFTER THAT; AN ACFT MAY DSND DOWN TO 480 FT MSL. BECAUSE WE WERE EXTENDED; THE C425 ON APCH HAD DSNDED SEVERELY DOWN TO APPROX 800 FT MSL. CAMARILLO DOES NOT HAVE RADAR IN THE TWR CAB. THEY HAVE TO RELY ON 'STRIPS' ACQUIRED OVER THE PHONE OR RADIO FROM NEARBY TWRS/APCH CTL.

THEY OVERLAID THE TFC PATTERN AND THE APCH INTO OXR AND THE CTLRS WERE SHOCKED TO SEE HOW THEY OVERLAPPED EACH OTHER. THE CTLRS HAVE SINCE BEEN MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE ABOUT CONTACTING APCH FOR OXR TO ASSURE THAT THE APCH CTLRS NOTIFY CMA CTLRS OF TFC ON THE VOR OR ILS APCHS.

THE APPLICANT CHKED THE TANKS BY UTILIZING THE FUEL GAUGES AND A VISUAL CHK OF THE TANKS AS WELL AS DIPPING THE TANKS TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL. IT WAS DETERMINED THERE WAS APPROX 16 GALLONS AND AT THE PUBLISHED RATE OF FUEL BURN OF SLIGHTLY LESS THAN 6 GALLONS PER HR; THE ACFT SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH FUEL FOR APPROX 2 1/2 HRS. THE PRACTICAL TEST NORMALLY TAKES APPROX 1 1/2 HRS FROM THIS ARPT UNDER THE LIGHT TFC CONDITIONS PREVAILING AT THE TIME. THE APPLICANT'S LNDGS WERE PERFORMED AT PALM BEACH COUNTY GLADES; LOCALLY KNOWN AS PAHOKEE ARPT; IN PAHOKEE; FL. THIS ARPT IS LOCATED APPROX 30 MI FROM LANTANA ARPT AND ON THE XCOUNTRY RTE PLANNED BY THE APPLICANT. 2 GARS WERE MADE BY THE APPLICANT BECAUSE OF TFC CONFLICTS WITH ULTRALIGHT ACFT WHICH WERE NOT MONITORING THE UNICOM FREQ; THEREFORE THE ACFT MADE 4 TFC PATTERNS INSTEAD OF THE 2 WHICH WERE ACTUALLY NEEDED AT PAHOKEE. THE ACFT WAS RETURNING TO LANTANA ARPT WITH THE APPLICANT UNDER THE HOOD AND HAD BEEN AIRBORNE APPROX 1 HR 35 MINS (HOBBS INDICATED 1.7 HRS SINCE ENG START).

THE FUEL GAUGES WERE INDICATING 1/4 TANK PER SIDE AT THE TIME. THE ACFT WAS LANDED OFF ARPT IN A FRESHLY PLOWED FIELD WITH MINOR DAMAGE (NOSEWHEEL AND PROP) AND NO INJURIES. THE WINGS WERE REMOVED AFTER THE ACFT WAS RELEASED TO THE OWNER BY THE FAA (APPROX 4 HRS AFTER THE LNDG). WHEN THE WINGS WERE REMOVED; LESS THAN 1 GALLON OF FUEL WAS RECOVERED. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FUEL WAS LOST AFTER THE LNDG AS THE ACFT SAT NOSE DOWN IN THE PLOWED FIELD; BUT THE ENG INDICATIONS ON FAILURE WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE INDICATIONS OF FUEL STARVATION. I HAVE REACHED THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS CONCERNING THE INCIDENT: 1) THE ACFT WAS OPERATED BY THE APPLICANT AT THE PWR SETTINGS USED FOR HIS FUEL CALCULATIONS. 2) THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD GIVEN A FLT TEST IN THIS PARTICULAR CESSNA 152 AND WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH ITS PARTICULAR FUEL CONSUMPTION OR FUEL GAUGE INACCURACY. 3) THE FLT MANUAL FUEL CALCULATIONS ONLY APPLY IF THE ACFT IS LEANED TO A VERY HOT MIXTURE; AND THUS THE ACFT BURNED MORE FUEL THAN THE FLT MANUAL FIGURES DUE TO THE EXTRA LNDGS AND THE MANEUVERS REQUIRED FOR THE PRACTICAL TEST. 4) THE FUEL GAUGES WERE INCORRECT; AS THAT THEY DID NOT INDICATE EMPTY WHEN EMPTY WHICH IS REALLY THE ONLY REQUIREMENT OF A PART 23 ACFT. AND 5) I DID NOT PERSONALLY DIP THE TANK BUT WATCHED THE APPLICANT AND TOOK HIS WORD. AS CORRECTIVE ACTION; I WILL NOT FLY AND/OR GIVE FLT CHKS WITH REDUCED FUEL LOADS EXCEPT UNDER THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS: 1) I HAVE FLOWN THE ACFT AND AM FAMILIAR WITH ITS FUEL CONSUMPTION AND ACCURACY OF ITS FUEL GAUGES. 2) THE ACFT IS FILLED WITH FUEL AND A KNOWN AMOUNT DRAINED OUT UNDER MY SUPERVISION. 3) I WILL PERSONALLY DIP THE FUEL TANKS FOR THE PROPER AMOUNT OF FUEL; AND WILL USE 16 GALLONS AS AN ABSOLUTE MINIMUM FOR FLT.

I REALIZED; ONCE OVER WEST POINT; THAT I WAS VERY LOW ON GAS; SO I IMMEDIATELY TURNED DOWN THE HUDSON AND TOWARDS MY ARPT. THEN I CHKED AGAIN; THE GAUGES WERE REALLY LOW. IT LOOKED LIKE 3 GALS; OR ONE HALF HR OF FLT TIME. CLOSE; SO I LOOKED FOR A CLOSER ARPT; SELECTED WESTCHESTER COUNTY; AND HEADED TOWARDS IT. WHILE IN CONTACT WITH WESTCHESTER RADAR; I HEARD THE FIRST SPUTTER; AND SOON THE ENG WAS NO LONGER TURNING. I INFORMED WESTCHESTER THAT I WAS DECLARING AN EMER; AND THAT I WOULD TRY TO SET THE PLANE DOWN ON A NEARBY HWY. I LANDED ON THE TACONIC PARKWAY; NO INJURIES TO ME (ONLY OCCUPANT); NO CONTACT WITH ANY CARS; NO DAMAGE TO THE PLANE; WHICH I STEERED OFF THE HWY ONTO THE SHOULDER. THOUGHTS: THE BELIEF THAT A 'LCL' FLT TEB/LCL IS A SHORT ONE; THAT REQUIRES A BIT LESS ATTN WAS INCORRECT. I HAD REJECTED THE FIRST PLANE THE FBO SUGGESTED; BECAUSE IT HAD A LARGE; PREVIOUSLY UNREPORTED DENT IN THE LEADING EDGE OF 1 WING. I FELT VIRTUOUS AND COCKY -- 'I AM A CAUTIOUS PLT;' WHICH MADE ME THINK; 'I CAN BE LESS THOROUGH.' THE C152 ALSO BURNS ROUGHLY 8 GPH; RATHER THAN THE 7 GPH I USUALLY ASSUME FOR A C150. IN GENERAL; PLT TRAINING HAS 2 MODES -- TOUCH AND GOES AT THE LCL ARPT (WITH SOME AIRWORK AT THE BEGINNING) AND XCOUNTRY PLANNING AND FLYING. THE FIRST GENERALLY DE-EMPHASIZE FUEL; BECAUSE LESSONS ARE RARELY LONGER THAN 1 HR. EXAMPLE: XCOUNTRY PLANNING DEFINITELY COVERS FUEL USAGE; AND PUNCHING THE NUMBERS TO CONFIRM HOW MUCH WILL BE USED. SIGHT-SEEING AND TOOLING AROUND THE ACFT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY GONE OVER. I NEVER HAD THE BRAINS TO ASK; 'SO; WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT JUST GOING UP; FLYING AROUND; AND LOOKING AT STUFF?' ONE ANSWER IS: 'IT'S EASY TO LOSE TRACK OF TIME WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE A PARTICULAR GOAL.' A PLT FRIEND SAYS HE HAS A COUNTDOWN TIMER SET ON HIS WRISTWATCH THAT BEEPS WHEN HE HAS A 30 MIN RESERVE CALCULATED. THIS IS A METHOD I WILL APPLY IN THE FUTURE. ALSO; THE CONSIDERATIONS AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS NOTWITHSTANDING; THIS IS A PRETTY CLR CASE OF A PLT BEING STUPID; THEN GETTING LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO WRITE THIS RPT.",,,,"C152 PLT RUNS OUT OF GAS; LANDS ON HWY.",

SEVERAL OTHER AIRPLANES WERE IN THE PATTERN; AS WELL AS A B206 HELI. MY AIRPLANE STUDENT IS A HIGH-TIME B206 PLT AND WE BOTH OBSERVED AND AGREED THAT THE B206 WAS HAVING A TOUGH TIME WITH THEIR CTL ON THEIR APCHS. THE B206 WAS FULL-STOPPING TO A HOVER OVER THE NUMBERS ON RWY 19L ON SEVERAL CIRCUITS AND WAS TAKING QUITE A LONG TIME TO TKOF AFTER EACH APCH AND WAS SLOWING DOWN THE TFC PATTERN AND I BELIEVE THAT SEVERAL AIRPLANES HAD TO GAR BECAUSE THE B206 HADN'T CLRED THE RWY. ON ONE OF OUR FULL-STOP TAXI BACKS WE OBSERVED THE B206 TKOF DOWN RWY 19L AFTER REQUESTING AN 'AIR TAXI' TO THE COMPASS ROSE AT THE END OF RWY 19L. THE HELI FLEW AT ABOUT 100 FT AGL. THEN WE WERE CLRED INTO POS AND HOLD ON RWY 19L AND RIGHT AWAY FOR TKOF FOR L CLOSED TFC. TWR ADVISED US TO MAINTAIN VISUAL SEPARATION ON THE HELI AHEAD BUT DID NOT ADVISE US ABOUT ROTOR-WAKE TURB.

A COUPLE OF CIRCUITS LATER THE HELI WAS BACK IN THE PATTERN WITH US AND AT ONE POINT TWR CALLED THE HELI TO SCOLD THEM ABOUT MESSING UP THE PATTERN. THE HELI THEN REQUESTED AN AIR TAXI TO THE SE PADS AND WAS CLRED FOR THAT REQUEST. TWR THEN CLRED US TO TKOF AGAIN BEHIND THE HELI. I TOLD MY STUDENT TO HOLD IN POS AND REQUESTED A DELAY FOR 'ROTOR TURB AVOIDANCE.' IT THEN BECAME OBVIOUS THAT TWR WAS UNAWARE OF THE DANGER.

THE DAMAGE APPEARED TO BE A 3 INCH DIAMETER DENT WHICH HAD BEEN POUNDED OUT FROM INSIDE THE SPINNER LOCATED ABOUT 1/2 WAY BTWN THE TIP OF THE SPINNER AND THE PROP BLADE. IT APPEARED THAT SOMEONE EITHER TAXIED A WINGTIP INTO THE SPINNER OR SOMEONE TOWED AN AIRPLANE WINGTIP INTO THE SPINNER. I WALKED DOWN THE TIE-DOWN LINE TO SEE IF I COULD FIND AN AIRPLANE WITH RED PAINT XFER ON THE WINGTIP. THE FIRST AIRPLANE I EXAMINED HAD RED PAINT XFERS THAT MATCHED Z'S COLOR ON THE WINGTIP. THE PAINT XFER WAS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE DROPPED SECTION OF THE WINGTIP.

I AM A COMMERCIAL PLT WITH INST AND MULTI-ENG AIRPLANE RATINGS; AS WELL AS A CERTIFIED FLT INSTRUCTOR FOR SINGLE ENG LAND ACFT. MY PAX WAS ALSO AN INST RATED COMMERCIAL PLT AND CERTIFIED FLT INSTRUCTOR. THE ACFT WAS TOPPED OFF WITH 100LL AVIATION FUEL AT THE LAKE HAVASU ARPT. TOTAL FUEL CAPACITY FOR THIS ACFT IS 26 GALLONS WITH 24.5 GALLONS USABLE. AFTER OBTAINING A WX BRIEFING FOR THE FLT; I DEPARTED AT APPROX XA30 AND CLBED WBOUND TO AN ALT OF 6500 FT. THE FUEL MIXTURE WAS LEANED AFTER PASSING THROUGH 3000 FT MSL AND AGAIN WHEN REACHING CRUISE ALT. THE RTE OF FLT WAS THROUGH THE TURTLE AND BRISTOL MOA N OF RESTR AREA R-2501N; DIRECT HECTOR VOR AND PARALLEL TO V12 AIRWAY OUTBOUND FROM HECTOR DIRECTLY OVER VCV ARPT IN VICTORVILLE TOWARD THE JUNCTION OF THE ANTELOPE VALLEY FREEWAY AND HWY 138 IN PALMDALE (PALMDALE PASS). FROM PALMDALE THE RTE WAS OVER THE CITY OF SANTA CLARITA; THROUGH THE NEWHALL PASS AND INBOUND TO VAN NUYS. MY CALCULATIONS OF PERFORMANCE FOR THIS FLT WERE BASED ON INFO OBTAINED FROM THE POH FOR THE C152 ACFT WHICH WAS ABOARD THE ACFT DURING THE FLT. THE DISTANCE FOR THIS FLT WAS 215 NM FOR THE RTE SELECTED. PWR SETTINGS USED FOR THE FLT WERE APPROX 60-65 PERCENT OF BRAKE HORSEPWR; AND UP TO 75 PERCENT OF BRAKE HORSEPWR FOR SHORT DURATION AS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN ALT IN TURB. RANGE ESTIMATES OBTAINED FROM THE POH FOR THESE PWR SETTINGS ARE BTWN 350 AND 390 NM. FUEL CONSUMPTION FOR THESE PWR SETTINGS ARE 4.9 TO 6.1 GPH (STANDARD TEMP AND PRESSURE; 6000 FT PRESSURE ALT). ENDURANCE IS BTWN 4 HRS AND 10 MINS AT 60 PERCENT PWR; TO 3.5 HRS AT FULL THROTTLE. BASED ON THESE ESTIMATES; I DETERMINED THAT THE ACFT WAS SUITED TO MAKE THIS FLT IN A SAFE MANNER. WX CONDITIONS DEPARTING LAKE HAVASU WERE WIND CALM WITH A VERY HIGH CLOUD DECK. FLT CONDITIONS WERE SMOOTH THROUGH TURTLE AND BRISTOL MOA'S. APCHING HECTOR VOR; LIGHT AND THEN MODERATE TURB WAS ENCOUNTERED. THE FLT REMAINED TURBULENT THROUGHOUT THE ANTELOPE VALLEY. SURFACE WINDS AT VCV WERE 250 DEGS AT 25 KTS; GUSTING TO 30 KTS. STRONG HEADWINDS WERE ENCOUNTERED AT 6500 FT AS WELL. I WAS IN CONTACT WITH VCV TWR AS I TRANSITIONED OVER THEIR ARPT WBOUND. FLT INSTS AND FUEL QUANTITY WERE INDICATING NORMAL AND THE FLT WAS PROCEEDING AS PLANNED AT THIS POINT. I CONTACTED JOSHUA APCH FOR VFR FLT FOLLOWING AND A MODE C CHK AND REQUESTED CURRENT WX AT VAN NUYS. VAN NUYS WX WAS 1600 FT BROKEN WITH 5 MI IN HAZE. MODE C WAS OPERATING NORMALLY. AFTER REACHING THE PALMDALE PASS INTXN OF THE ANTELOPE VALLEY FREEWAY AND HWY 138 I WAS PREPARING TO SETUP THE ACFT FOR ARR IN VAN NUYS. WE HAD BEEN AIRBORNE FOR 3 HRS AT THIS POINT. I VISUALLY SAW WILLIAM J. FOX AIRFIELD IN LANCASTER OFF TO MY R; AND REVIEWED MY FUEL STATUS AGAIN AT THIS TIME. THE R TANK WAS INDICATING HIGHER THAN THE L TANK AND BOTH WERE FLUCTUATING AS A RESULT OF THE TURB. THE L TANK INDICATED BTWN 2-3 GALLONS AND THE R TANK WAS SHOWING ALMOST 5 GALLONS. I CONCLUDED THAT THERE WERE BTWN 6-7 GALLONS OF FUEL REMAINING AT THAT TIME. THIS INDICATION SHOWED APPROX 1 HR OF FUEL REMAINING AND WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE FLT PLANNING. I DETERMINED THAT THE FLT WAS PROCEEDING ACCORDING TO OUR PLAN AND CONTINUED THE FLT ENRTE TO VAN NUYS. I BEGAN A DSCNT AT THE PALMDALE PASS TO APPROX 4500 FT. APCHING THE NEWHALL PASS THE ENG BEGAN TO RUN ROUGH. I IMMEDIATELY APPLIED CARB HEAT AND ENRICHED THE FUEL MIXTURE TO FULL. I MADE A 180 DEG TURN AWAY FROM THE PASS AND HEADED TO AGUA DULCE WHICH WAS APPROX 8-10 MI E OF OUR POS. THE ENG CONTINUED TO SPUTTER AT THIS POINT. I DETERMINED THAT THE ACFT COULD NOT MAINTAIN ALT TO MAKE AGUA DULCE AND DECIDED TO MAKE AN OFF ARPT LNDG. I SELECTED 2 POSSIBLE LNDG AREAS. THE FIRST WAS THE DRY WASH WHICH RUNS E-W NEXT TO THE ANTELOPE VALLEY FREEWAY; THE SECOND ALTERNATIVE WAS THE ANTELOPE VALLEY FREEWAY ITSELF. I DECIDED THAT TFC ON THE NBOUND SIDE WAS SUFFICIENTLY LIGHT AND THERE WAS A LONG STRAIGHT SECTIONTO MY FRONT. AS I APCHED THE HWY; I DSNDED ABOVE ANY TFC BEHIND ME AND WIGGLED THE WINGS. THERE WERE NO OBSTRUCTIONS TO MY FRONT SO I PROCEEDED TO LAND ON THE NBOUND LANES OF THE ANTELOPE VALLEY FREEWAY JUST S OF THE SAND CANYON OFFRAMP.

I WAS PROVIDING BASIC FLT INSTRUCTION FOR A STUDENT PLT IN A C152; OPERATING BTWN 900-1200 FT AGL AND APPROX 8-10 NM NW OF NAS NIP AT APPROX AD15Z ON MAY/XA/97. THE AIRSPACE INVOLVED IS CLASS E AIRSPACE. WHILE SUPERVISING MY STUDENT DURING LEVEL MEDIUM BANKED TURNS; I OBSERVED ANOTHER ACFT OPERATING IN THE SAME GENERAL AREA AND NEAR THE SAME ALT. I POINTED OUT THE OTHER ACFT TO MY STUDENT AND COACHED HIM THROUGH TURNS TO AVOID FLYING CLOSE TO THE OTHER ACFT. HOWEVER; THE OTHER ACFT APPEARED TO BE MANEUVERING SO AS TO GET CLOSER TO US RATHER THAN TO AVOID A CONFLICT.

THE PLT OF ACFT Y STATED OVER THE RADIO THAT HE WAS WORKING A LAW ENFORCEMENT MISSION AND HAD HIS HEAD DOWN! JAX APCH FORWARDED A REQUEST FROM THE OTHER PLT THAT I MOVE TO ANOTHER AREA TO CONDUCT MY TRAINING. I VOICED MY CONCERN TO JAX APCH THAT IT WAS UNSAFE FOR THE OTHER PLT TO BE OPERATING VFR WITH HIS HEAD DOWN; AND THEN I DEPARTED THE AREA WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. I LATER LEARNED THAT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT MISSION WAS A FLORIDA HWY PATROL SPD TRAP FOR CARS TRAVELING ON I-295 NEAR JACKSONVILLE; FL. I ALSO LEARNED (NOT CONFIRMED) THAT THE PLT IN QUESTION IS RELYING ON TCASII FOR COLLISION AVOIDANCE AND FLIES WITH HIS HEAD DOWN (PRESUMABLY WATCHING CARS). I AM CONCERNED ABOUT SEVERAL SAFETY ISSUES; AS LISTED HERE: 1) THE OTHER PLT CONDUCTED UNBRIEFED FORMATION FLT. 2) JAX APCH KNEW ABOUT THE UNBRIEFED FORMATION FLT AND APPEARED TO CONDONE IT. 3) THE OTHER PLT ADMITTED FLYING WITH HIS HEAD DOWN (NO SEE-AND-AVOID). 4) THE OTHER PLT HAD NO REASON TO GET MY SIDE NUMBER AND JAX APCH SHOULD NOT HAVE NEEDED IT BECAUSE I WAS TALKING TO THEM AND IDENTING MYSELF. 5) THE OTHER PLT SEEMS TO BE USING INTIMIDATION TACTICS TO RUN OTHER TFC OUT OF THE AREA HE IS TRYING TO WORK. HE IS FLYING IN FORMATION AND RECORDING SIDE NUMBERS OF ACFT THAT ARE OPERATING IN CLASS E AIRSPACE UNDER VFR CONDITIONS. HIS MISSION IS NOT COVERED BY NOTAM; AND PLTS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO CONTACT APCH PRIOR TO OPERATING IN THAT AREA. 6) I CALLED THE JAX APCH FACILITY BY TELEPHONE AFTER THE INCIDENT AND THE CTLR TOOK THE POS THAT IT IS BUSY AIRSPACE AND I SHOULD CONSIDER TRAINING ELSEWHERE. HE TOLD ME THAT IF I HAD CALLED FOR FLT FOLLOWING THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A PROB (WE ALL KNOW HOW HARD THAT CAN BE DURING PLT TRAINING FLTS WITH NEW STUDENTS).

ON APCH TO VGT; I TRIED TO CONTACT THE TWR; BUT WITH NO SUCCESS. I SQUAWKED 7600 AND THE TWR TOLD ME TO SWITCH MY XPONDER TO 'STANDBY;' IF I COULD RECEIVE HIS XMISSION. I DID AND DSNDED TO PATTERN ALT TO THE L AS WAS THE USUAL WITH THE RWY IN USE. THE TWR TOLD ME TO WATCH FOR THE LIGHT GUN. I DID; AND THE LIGHT SHONE STEADY GREEN.

THE NEW FAR 61.109 (A)(2)(I) REQUIRES ONE NIGHT XCOUNTRY OF OVER 100 NM. THE STUDENT PLT PROPERLY PREPARED THE FLT AND I CAREFULLY CHKED THE PLANNING. ANNAPOLIS LEE ARPT HAS AN XC00 PM CURFEW AND IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE RWY LIGHTS WERE TURNED OFF A 'FEW MINS' AFTER XC00 PM TO ENFORCE THE CURFEW. THE TIME ENRTE FROM ALLENTOWN TO LEE WAS 1 HR 15 MINS. WITH THESE CONSTRAINTS IN MIND WE PLANNED A TKOF TO OCCUR AT XA35. A CHANGE OF RWYS AT ALLENTOWN CAUSED THE TKOF TO BE DELAYED. ALTERNATE PLANS HAD BEEN MADE TO LAND AT BWI AND SOMEONE WAS STANDING BY TO PICK US UP IF WE EXCISED THAT ALTERNATIVE. PASSING BWI WE CHKED THE ATIS WINDS SO THAT WE COULD SET UP A TFC PATTERN AT LEE. THE WINDS WERE RPTED AT 260 DEGS AT 8 KTS INDICATING THAT AN APCH TO RWY 30 SHOULD BE PLANNED. THE INCIDENT: AS WE SET UP THE LNDG PATTERN FOR RWY 30 WE NOTED THAT AN ACFT HAD JUST LANDED ON RWY 12. ASSUMING THAT THIS WAS THE MOST FAVORABLE RWY; WE TRANSITIONED TO A DOWNWIND FOR RWY 30. BY THE TIME WE HAD SET UP ON DOWNWIND THE TIME WAS XC00 PM AND WE EXPECTED THE RWY LIGHTS TO GO OUT MOMENTARILY. THE STUDENT'S APCH WAS HIGH AND A LITTLE FAST. UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES I WOULD HAVE DIRECTED A GAR WHILE WELL OUT ON FINAL. HOWEVER; BECAUSE OF THE IMPENDING TURN-OFF OF THE RWY LIGHTS; I TOOK CTL OF THE ACFT WELL OUT ON FINAL AND ESTABLISHED A SLIP WITH FLAPS EXTENDED AND IDLE PWR. BY THE TIME WE CROSSED THE OVERRUN AREA WE WERE ON GLIDE PATH (VASI) BUT FAST -- ABOUT 75 KIAS. I WAS SURE THAT IF I COULD GET THE ACFT ON THE GND BY MID-FIELD THAT I COULD EASILY STOP THE ACFT IN THE REMAINING RWY. I KNEW THE LNDG WAS NOT GOING TO BE PRETTY; BUT I KNEW I COULD GET STOPPED. I HAD SEEN PEOPLE LAND FAST AT MID-FIELD AND HAVE NO PROB STOPPING. I TOUCHED DOWN AT MID-FIELD AND BECAUSE OF THE STILL EXCESSIVE SPD SKIPPED SLIGHTLY AND CAME BACK DOWN QUICKLY. BRAKING WAS INEFFECTIVE BECAUSE OF THE LIFT THAT WAS STILL BEING DEVELOPED; BUT I WAS STILL SURE WE WERE GOING TO STOP. HOWEVER; BRAKING CONTINUED TO BE INEFFECTIVE AS I TRIED TO KEEP FROM LOCKING THE WHEELS. ON OCCASION THE WHEELS DID START TO SKID AND I RELEASED PRESSURE TO MAINTAIN A NEAR SKID CONDITION. THE FIRST TIME THAT I RECOGNIZED I WAS IN TROUBLE WAS WHEN I SAW THE RWY NUMBERS APCHING (ABOUT 400 FT FROM THE END OF A PAVED OVERRUN). I WAS SURPRISED THAT I HAD TRAVELED SO FAR DOWN THE RWY. THE ACFT WENT OFF THE END OF THE RWY AT ABOUT 15-20 MPH AND FURTHER BRAKING WAS TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE ON THE GRASS OVERRUN. I STEERED THE ACFT TO IMPACT THE CHAIN LINK FENCE (ABOUT 200 FT FROM THE END OF THE RWY) BTWN 2 FENCE POSTS; AND IMPACTED AT 5-10 MPH. ENG WAS AT IDLE. THE 2 FENCE POSTS IMPACTED THE LEADING EDGE OF EACH WING APPROX 4 FT FROM THE TIPS MAKING A SUBSTANTIAL DENT IN EACH LEADING EDGE. THE FENCE BROKE LOOSE FROM THE POSTS AND BROUGHT THE ACFT TO A STOP. SWITCHES WERE TURNED OFF AND THE ACFT ABANDONED. POST INCIDENT: I OBSERVED THE WINDSOCK AND NOTED THAT THERE WAS A SLIGHT TAILWIND ON LNDG; PROBABLY ABOUT 5 KTS. WE REMOVED THE ACFT FROM THE FENCE (BECAUSE IT WAS IN THE APCH PATH FOR ACFT) AND PUSHED IT BACK TO THE TIE- DOWN AREA WHERE WE SECURED THE ACFT. DAMAGE APPEARED TO BE LIMITED TO DENTS IN THE R AND L LEADING EDGES OF THE WING WITH A WRINKLE ON THE AFT INBOARD L WING. I CLOSED MY VFR FLT PLAN WITH LEESBURG AND CALLED THE CLUB MGR TO RPT THE INCIDENT. REMARKS: I WAS TOTALLY OBSESSED WITH THE THOUGHT THAT THE RWY LIGHTS WOULD BE GOING OUT MOMENTARILY; EVEN THOUGH I HAD A GOOD AND SAFE ALTERNATE PLAN. IN THE DARK I LOST ORIENTATION CONCERNING HOW MUCH RWY WAS REMAINING UNTIL I SAW THE NUMBERS COMING UP. 10 YRS AGO I WOULD HAVE AUTOMATICALLY RETRACTED THE FLAPS ON TOUCHDOWN. HOWEVER; AS A RESULT OF PEOPLE RETRACTING THE GEAR INSTEAD OF FLAPS; I NO LONGER TEACH THIS TECHNIQUE AND OVERLOOKED IT MYSELF IN THIS CASE. IF I HAD RETRACTEDTHE FLAPS I WOULD NOT HAVE HIT THE FENCE. THIS MAY NOT BE THE DUMBEST THING I HAVE EVER DONE; BUT IT CERTAINLY RANKS IN THE TOP 10. IN MY PREVIOUS 40+ YRS OF FLYING I HAVE NOT DAMAGED AN ACFT.

ON DOWNWIND; I ADVISED THE TWR THAT MY INTENTIONS WERE TO BE A FULL STOP LNDG FOR TAXI BACK FOR A TRAINING FLT WITH MY STUDENT PLT. I WAS CLRED TO LAND ON RWY 19L BUT ADVISED 'CAUTION WAKE TURB FOR AN AIRBUS A320 FOR RWY 19R.' I RPTED THE TFC IN SIGHT AND ALLOWED MY STUDENT TO CONTINUE THE APCH AND LNDG CAUTIONING HIM TO TAKE WAKE TURB AVOIDANCE PROCS. SPECIFICALLY; I TOLD MY STUDENT TO STAY ABOVE THE A320'S FLT PATH AND NOTE THE A320'S TOUCHDOWN POINT SO THAT WE WOULD PLAN TO TOUCH DOWN BEYOND THAT POINT. THE AIRBUS A320 TOUCHED DOWN JUST SLIGHTLY PAST THE 1000 FT AIMING POINT OF RWY 19R; THEREFORE I MENTIONED TO MY STUDENT THAT WE SHOULD PLAN ON TOUCHING DOWN BY INTXN J. WE DID NOT ENCOUNTER ANY WAKE TURB DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE STAYED ABOVE THE AIRBUS' FLT PATH; HOWEVER; MY STUDENT TOUCHED DOWN APPROX 50 FT PAST OUR INTENDED TOUCHDOWN POINT AND RESULTED IN A BOUNCED LNDG AS WELL. HIS REACTION TO THE BOUNCED LNDG WAS TO PITCH THE NOSE FORWARD AT WHICH TIME I TOOK OVER THE CTLS AND STATED 'MY AIRPLANE' AND PROCEEDED TO EXECUTE A GAR. I EXECUTED THE NORMAL GAR PROCS AND GLANCED OVER AT THE AIRSPD INDICATOR WHICH READ APPROX 45 KIAS. SINCE A CLBOUT AT THAT AIRSPD WITH FLAPS 20 DEGS WOULD BE DANGEROUSLY NEAR A STALLING ANGLE OF ATTACK; I LOWERED THE NOSE TO AN APPROX LEVEL PITCH ATTITUDE UNTIL REACHING 55 KIAS; AT WHICH TIME I RESUMED A NORMAL CLBOUT WHILE RETRACTING THE FINAL FLAPS UP 1 NOTCH AT A TIME. I FOLLOWED THE PRESCRIBED PROCS OF EXECUTING A 15 DEG L TURN AT THE END OF THE RWY TO AVOID TFC FOR RWY 19R. AFTER EXECUTING THE 15 DEG TURNOUT; I WOULD ESTIMATE THAT MY ALT WAS APPROX 100-150 FT AGL OVER TXWY A. I DID NOT SEE A HAWKER JET ON TXWY A AS MY CONCENTRATION WAS FOCUSED ON THE GAR AND ACCELERATING THE ACFT TO A SAFE CLBOUT SPD. ON MY RETURN ATTEMPT FOR LNDG; ON THE BASE LEG; I WAS ADVISED BY THE TWR TO GIVE THE TWR SUPVR A PHONE CALL AFTER MY TRAINING FLT WAS OVER. APPARENTLY UPON EXECUTION OF THE GAR I HAD FLOWN OVER A HAWKER JET ON TXWY A AT AN ALT THAT THE HAWKER PLT THOUGHT WAS UNSAFE. AFTER SHUTDOWN; I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED THE TWR SUPVR; AND EXPLAINED THE SIT REGARDING THE GAR. THE SUPVR ON DUTY; MR X; SAID THAT THIS TYPE OF OCCURRENCE HAPPENS FREQUENTLY; HOWEVER; SINCE THE HAWKER PLT WAS VERY UPSET; THAT HE WANTED TO WRITE UP A STATEMENT BUT WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN INCIDENT. I LEFT MR X WITH MY FLT SCHOOL AS WELL AS MY HOME TELEPHONE NUMBER IN THE EVENT THAT HE HAD ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR IF THE PLT OF THE HAWKER WANTED TO CONSULT ME. I WAS ASSURED BY THE TWR SUPVR THAT NO ACTION WOULD BE TAKEN BY THE TWR AS NO VIOLATION OF THE FARS WERE PRESENT. I CURRENTLY AM EMPLOYED AS A FLT INSTRUCTOR WITH AN FBO AS WELL AS A CUSTOMER SVC REPRESENTATIVE AT AN ACR AT SNA. FOLLOWING THE EVENT; I CONSULTED MR Y; PRESIDENT OF THE FBO; AS WELL AS MR Z; A MECH WHO WORKS FOR THE ACR AT SNA; AS WELL AS AN ACCIDENT PREVENTION COUNSELOR WITH THE LONG BEACH FSDO. THEY BOTH REASONED THAT THERE WAS NO VIOLATION OF THE FARS; HOWEVER; SUBMITTING AN ASRS FORM WAS A RECOMMENDATION. GIVEN THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS; I BELIEVE THAT THE STEPS I TOOK WERE PERTINENT TO THE SAFETY OF FLT. SPECIFICALLY; PLANNING A LONG LNDG FOR WAKE TURB AVOIDANCE PROCS; AS WELL AS EXECUTING A GAR FOLLOWING A BOUNCED LNDG WAS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF SAFETY. THE ONLY CONSIDERATION THAT I FEEL THAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE WAS TO DELAY THE 15 DEG OFFSET TURN UNTIL A SLIGHTLY HIGHER ALT.

THE ASOS WAS RPTING 070 DEGS AT 5 KTS AND THE SOCK WAS RPTING THAT THE WIND WAS FAVORING RWY 6 AT THE SAME WIND SPD.

AS WE TURNED FINAL I SAW THE OTHER ACFT LOWER AND IMMEDIATELY AHEAD SLIGHTLY R OF COURSE FOR RWY 17R. I IMMEDIATELY QUERIED THE TWR 'VERIFY (US) CLRED TOUCH AND GO RWY 17R AND ACFT AHEAD CLRED RWY 17L.'

THEY CLRED US FOR 360 DEG TURN TO FINAL TOUCH AND GO RWY 17R. I BELIEVE THE PROB WAS CAUSED BY SEVERAL FACTORS: 1) CASUAL MONITORING BY TWR (NO ADVISORY OF TFC TO THE PARALLEL RWY). 2) INSTRUCTION TO OTHER ACFT TO SWITCH RWY WAS NOT ACKNOWLEDGED CORRECTLY THE FIRST TIME; AND AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WAS NOT RESOLICITED BY THE TWR. 3) POOR RWY ALIGNMENT OF OTHER ACFT. 4) INADEQUATE VISUAL SCANNING TECHNIQUES OF MYSELF AND OTHER PLT. 5) I WAS INSTRUCTED TO 'ENTER R BASE' BUT NOT TO 'RPT ENTERING' WHICH LED ME TO EXPECT THEY WERE MORE CLOSELY MONITORING OUR POS BY RADAR OR VISUAL CONTACT. TO CORRECT THE PROB: 1) PLTS SHOULD BE INSTRUCTED TO 'RPT ENTERING' TO AID ATC AS WELL AS OTHER PLTS IN THE PATTERN WITH ORIENTATION. 2) PARALLEL APCHS SHOULD BE CLOSELY MONITORED AND TIMELY ADVISORIES ISSUED. 3) AT LEAST A STRONG WORD SHOULD BE SHARED WITH PLTS WHO WANDER INTO ADJACENT FINAL APCH COURSES (I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING IF THE OTHER PLT WAS LATER TALKED WITH ON GND FREQ OR TELEPHONE).",,,,"C152 CFI PERFORMS A GAR AT DWH TO AVOID ACFT ON FINAL AHEAD OF HIS ACFT.

MY CRUISE ALT WAS 6500 FT AGL ON MY ALTIMETER. ALTIMETER SET AT PULLMAN AFTER RECEIVING INFO FROM SEATTLE RADIO WHEN ACTIVATING FLT PLAN. FLT WAS GOING AS PLANNED. I STARTED TO PREPARE FOR APCH AND INITIAL CONTACT WITH FELTS FIELD ATC; AFTER PASSING MY FINAL CHK POINT (FAIRFIELD) BEFORE RADIO COM WITH FELTS FIELD ATC OVER MICA. I HAD BEEN LISTENING AND RECORDING ATIS INFO XX BEFORE FAIRFIELD CHK POINT AND SWITCH OVER TO SPOKANE APCH TO MONITOR TFC AND CONDITIONS IN THE AREA OF SPOKANE. I REACH 3600 FT AROUND FREEMAN WHICH WAS ROUGHLY 2000 FT ABOVE THE GND LOOKING DOWN AND I WAS STARTING TO SEE MIST AHEAD AROUND THE HILLS. I SWITCH OVER TO FELTS FIELD TO MONITOR TFC AT THE ARPT. I WAS SWITCHING BACK AND FORTH BTWN SPOKANE APCH AND FELTS FIELD ATC TO MONITOR TFC AND LEARN ANYTHING I COULD ABOUT CONDITIONS IN AND AROUND SPOKANE. I ALIGNED THE PLANE TO PASSING OVER MICA AND INTO THE SPOKANE VALLEY. I WAS ABOUT 5 MI FROM PASSING OVER THE HILLS; MAKING MY RADIO CALL TO FELTS FIELD ATC; AND I COULD SEE THE VALLEY. THE VIEW INTO THE VALLEY WAS NOT COMPLETELY CLR AND I DECIDE TO CHK ATIS ONE MORE TIME TO CONFIRM WX CONDITIONS IN THE SPOKANE VALLEY AND FELTS FIELD. I CONTINUED ON MY COURSE AND I COULD SEE INTO THE VALLEY BUT THE MIST SEEMS TO BE GETTING HEAVIER. I WAS GETTING CLOSE TO THE POINT OF MAKING MY CALL TO FELTS FIELD ATC; AND I NEEDED TO MAKE A DECISION OF TURNING AROUND OR CONTINUING BASED ON THE WX CONDITIONS AHEAD. THE WX DID NOT SEEM NOW WHAT WAS BEING RPTED EARLIER FROM DUAT; FAA FLT PLANNING; OR ATIS. I WANTED TO CONFIRM WX CONDITION ONCE MORE TO ENSURE I WAS WITHIN MY SAFE FLYING LIMITATIONS; FAA'S; AND STATE REQUIREMENTS BEFORE CONTACTING FELTS FIELD. IF I WAS TO TURN AROUND DUE TO WX; AND I WAS THINKING STRONGLY OF TURNING AROUND; I DID NOT WANT TO INTERFERE WITH RADIO TFC AT FELTS FIELD. I LOOKED DOWN TO MY NAV CHART TO GET ATIS FREQ WHEN I REMEMBERED ATIS RADIO FREQ WAS RECORDED ON MY FLT NOTES. I REACH DOWN TO PICK UP MY CLIPBOARD; LIFT UP THE FELTS FIELD MAP COVERING MY COURSE INFO; AND STARTED TO PUT IN THE RADIO FREQ FOR ATIS WHEN I HEARD A THUMP ON THE PLANE. I LOOKED UP AND WAS PULLING BACK ON THE YOKE AT THE SAME TIME. I COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING CLRLY. WHEN I WAS LOOKING DOWN FOR THE RADIO FREQ; I MUST HAVE TURNED TOWARDS THE HILLS SOME 3000 FT TO MY R SIDE AND INTO THE MIST I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT AROUND THE TOP OF THEM. I IMMEDIATELY LOOKED AT MY FLT INSTS TO SEE WHAT MY ORIENTATION WAS AND TO MAKE SURE THE PLANE WAS FLYING ON COURSE AND LEVEL. I MADE CORRECTIONS FROM CLBING TO LEVEL FLT. I WAS NOT COMING OUT OF THE MIST AND I WAS CONCERNED WHERE I WAS IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE HILLS THAT I WAS PASSING BTWN ORIGINALLY; SO I STARTED A NORMAL CLB. I PULLED BACK TOO FAR AND THE STALL INDICATOR WAS COMING ON. I PUSHED THE CTL WHEEL FORWARD BUT NOW THE ATTITUDE INDICATOR WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE. I LET GO OF THE CTL WHEEL TO LET THE PLANE CORRECT ITSELF (LESSON TOLD TO ME BY CHIEF FLT INSTRUCTOR) AND PLANE CAME BACK TO LEVEL FLT. I THEN STARTED A NORMAL CLB AGAIN; XCHKING SPD INDICATOR; TURN COORDINATOR; ATTITUDE INDICATOR; BECAUSE I STILL DID NOT KNOW WHERE I WAS AND I COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING. ABOUT 3-5 MINS LATER I CAME OUT OF THE CLOUDS AT AROUND 6000 FT ON MY ALTIMETER. I MADE A COURSE CORRECTION TO A HEADING OF S BECAUSE I COULD SEE THE GND TO MY R AND I CONTINUED TO CLB TO 6500 FT. I WAS STILL UNCERTAIN WHAT THE THUMP WAS AND I WAS STARTING A VISUAL CHK OF THE PLANE. I ALSO WANTED TO GET BACK OVER CLR VIEW OF THE GND; WHICH I KNEW WAS TO THE S OR IN THE DIRECTION I CAME FROM. I WAS ABLE TO VISUALLY SEE THE GND; WITHOUT WX OBSTRUCTION; WITHIN A MIN OF MAKING MY TURN TO THE S. AT THIS TIME I NOTICED MY LEADING FAR OUTSIDE EDGE OF THE L WING WAS DAMAGED. I CONTINUED TO MONITOR THE PLANE AND CHKED INSTS FOR SIGNS OF NEEDING TO MAKE AN EMER LNDG. PLANE WAS RESPONDING WITHOUT PROBS AND DID NOT WANT TO FLY BACK INTO THE QUESTIONABLE WX OF SPOKANE. I SET MY VOR FOR A COURSE BACK TO PULLMAN AND LANDED AT PULLMAN MOSCOW ARPT. UPON SEEING PULLMAN MOSCOW ARPT I CLOSED MY FLT PLAN WITH SEATTLE RADIO. AFTER LNDG I CONTACTED FBO STAFF TO RPT INCIDENT.

AFTER I LIFTED OFF AND CALLED TO ALERT THE SENECA TO MY PRESENCE; ANOTHER VOICE (THE CFI; I PRESUME) TOOK OVER THE RADIO. I BELIEVE MY DECISION TO USE RWY 21 WAS CORRECT GIVEN THE WIND. I ALSO BELIEVE I ACTED PROPERLY IN VISUALLY CLRING THE AREA AND MAKING A SELF-ANNOUNCE RADIO CALL BEFORE ENTERING THE RWY.

AFTER I MADE THE CALL TO TELL THE SENECA I WAS TAKING OFF; THE SENECA HELD ITS POS (INSTEAD OF PROCEEDING WITH THE TKOF).

THE PLAN WAS TO FLY VFR IN THE FLT SCHOOL'S C152 FROM N99 TO W29; AND THEN SWING AROUND TO ILG FOR 3 LNDGS IN CLASS D CTLED AIRSPACE; AND THEN RETURN HOME TO BRANDYWINE. I WAS MORE THAN ADEQUATELY TRAINED AND PREPARED FOR THE SOLO; AND WAS QUITE COMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA. SHORTLY AFTER LEAVING BRANDYWINE; THE LOW VOLTAGE LIGHT CAME ON; AND I NOTICED A VERY SLIGHT NEGATIVE CHARGE READING; INDICATING CURRENT BEING DRAWN FROM THE BATTERY. I WASN'T WORRIED; I HAD BEEN ASSURED MANY TIMES THAT THE ELECTRICAL SYS OF A C152 WAS ENTIRELY SEPARATE FROM THE ENG; AND ON MY LAST FLT IN THE SAME AIRPLANE MY INSTRUCTOR AND I HAD HAD THE SAME PROB. AT THAT TIME; HE MORE OR LESS IGNORED THE PROB; PROBABLY BECAUSE IT WAS A MINOR DRAIN AND WE WERE HEADED BACK ANYWAY. SO WHEN THE LOW VOLTAGE LIGHT CAME ON; I MORE OR LESS IGNORED IT; FIGURING THERE WASN'T MUCH I COULD DO AND I WAS ALREADY HALF WAY TO MY DEST. I DID TURN OFF MY LNDG LIGHTS; WHICH SEEMED TO HELP A BIT; BUT DUE TO THE HAZE AND LIMITED VISIBILITY I DIDN'T FEEL SAFE TURNING OFF THE NAV LIGHTS OR THE BEACON. I REACHED BAYBRIDGE WITH NO FURTHER TROUBLE; AND DEPARTED FOR WILMINGTON. I CONSIDERED GOING STRAIGHT BACK DUE TO THE LOW VOLTAGE LIGHT; BUT I DIDN'T THINK I HAD ENOUGH FUEL TO SAFELY MAKE IT ALL THE WAY BACK TO BRANDYWINE. SO I DECIDED TO PROCEED WITH THE ORIGINAL PLAN AND HEAD TO WILMINGTON; WITH PLANS TO FUEL UP THERE AND CALL THE FLT SCHOOL TO REQUEST ADVICE ON THE LOW VOLTAGE PROB. THE TRIP TO WILMINGTON WAS UNEVENTFUL; ALTHOUGH WHILE ON A DOWNWIND LEG FOR A LNDG THE TWR ASKED ME TO SQUAWK IDENT; WHICH I DID; AND WAS TOLD THAT AS FAR AS THEY COULD TELL I HAD NO XPONDER AT ALL. I PROCEEDED WITH THE LNDG; TAXIED TO THE RAMP; SHUT DOWN THE ENG AND HAD THE PLANE REFUELED. WHEN I TRIED TO START IT UP AGAIN; I FOUND THE BATTERY WAS MOSTLY DEAD. I CALLED THE FLT SCHOOL; AND WAS ADVISED TO GET A JUMP AND FLY THE PLANE BACK SO THEY COULD FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS WRONG; AND TO TRY CYCLING THE ALTERNATOR (A PROCESS I'D NEVER HEARD OF PRIOR TO THIS) IF IT ACTED UP AGAIN. I TOOK OFF WITHOUT INCIDENT; AND ADVISED THE TWR SHORTLY BEFORE TKOF THAT I WAS HAVING SOME ELECTRICAL DIFFICULTIES; JUST IN CASE IT BECAME AN ISSUE. APPROX 15 MI N OF WILMINGTON (HALF WAY TO BRANDYWINE); I FLEW INTO RAIN AND EVEN MORE HAZE; WHICH LOWERED MY VISIBILITY BEYOND WHAT I CONSIDERED SAFE; EVEN IN A FULLY OPERATIONAL ACFT. ABOUT THIS TIME I ALSO REALIZED THAT MY LIGHTS WERE NOW FULLY OUT; AND THE VOR NAV EQUIP I WAS USING AS A BACKUP TO MY OWN VISUAL REFS WASN'T RESPONDING. I TRIED THE RADIO; IT WAS COMPLETELY DEAD; AS WAS THE XPONDER. IN THESE CONDITIONS; THERE WAS NO WAY I COULD SAFELY FIND BRANDYWINE; AND WITH THE VISIBILITY DECREASING AND ALL MY LIGHTS OUT; I BEGAN TO FEAR A POSSIBLE COLLISION. I TURNED AROUND WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY AND PROCEEDED TO HEAD BACK TO WILMINGTON; ALTHOUGH I WASN'T ENTIRELY SURE HOW FAR OFF COURSE I HAD GOTTEN AND THUS EXACTLY WHICH DIRECTION WILMINGTON WAS. I WAS NERVOUS. I THOUGHT I COULD FIND WILMINGTON AGAIN; BUT ALL MY ELECTRICAL EQUIP WAS DEAD; THE VISIBILITY WAS BAD; AND I WAS BEGINNING TO HIT A BIT OF TURB. AMONGST ALL THIS EXCITEMENT; I ENTIRELY FORGOT THE FLT SCHOOL'S ADVICE OF CYCLING THE ALTERNATOR. I TOOK A FEW DEEP BREATHS; CALMED DOWN; AND HEADED SE; KNOWING THAT I'D HIT THE DELAWARE RIVER EVENTUALLY AND COULD FOLLOW IT DOWN TO A BRIDGE RIGHT NEXT TO WILMINGTON ARPT. I MANAGED TO FIND THE ARPT RATHER QUICKLY WITH THIS APCH; AND CAUTIOUSLY ENTERED THE PATTERN A FEW HUNDRED FT ABOVE NORMAL PATTERN ALT; IN THE HOPES IT'D HELP ME AVOID ANY OTHER ACFT IN THE PATTERN. BY NOW I WAS SURE THE CTL TWR MUST SEE ME AND KNOW SOMETHING WAS WRONG; AND I LOOKED TO THE CTL TWR FOR LIGHT SIGNALS; BUT I WASN'T ENTIRELY SURE WHERE TO LOOK -- ABOVE THE TWR; BENEATH IT? I WAS LATER TOLD THAT THE LIGHTS ARE HAND-HELD AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO THE TWR; BUT I HADN'T EVEN SPECULATED THIS AS A POSSIBILITY AT THE TIME (I WAS ENVISIONING SOME FORM OF STROBE LIGHTS). SO I DIDN'T SEE ANY LIGHT SIGNALS; BUT WAS FAIRLY SURE THEY WERE PROBABLY THERE SOMEWHERE. I CONSIDERED ROCKING THE WINGS TO LET THEM KNOW I WAS IN TROUBLE; BUT REMEMBERED SOMETHING I HAD READ IN A PVT PLT MANUAL AND DECIDED AGAINST IT. THE MANUAL STATES THAT A PLT WITH INOPERABLE COM EQUIP AT A CTLED AIRFIELD SHOULD ROCK HIS WINGS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE TWR'S LIGHT SIGNALS. I DIDN'T THINK IT'D BE SAFE TO ROCK THE WINGS AT THIS POINT; BECAUSE I HAD NOT SEEN THE TWR'S LIGHT SIGNALS; AND I DIDN'T WANT TO RISK ACKNOWLEDGING A LIGHT SIGNAL BY ACCIDENT; AND THEN POTENTIALLY DOING SOMETHING ELSE. SO I CONTINUED INTO A NICE; SLOW LNDG; PULLED OFF THE RWY AS FAST AS I COULD; AND CAUTIOUSLY TAXIED TO THE RAMP. I WAS MET BY ARPT SECURITY AND GAVE THEM THE FULL STORY. I TOLD HIM I HAD NO XPONDER; NO RADIO -- NO WAY OF COMMUNICATING WITH THE TWR WHATSOEVER; AND I DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH VISIBILITY OR FAMILIARITY WITH THE AREA TO SAFELY FIND AN UNCTLED ARPT TO LAND AT. AND WITH ALL MY LIGHTS OUT; THE DANGER OF A POTENTIAL COLLISION WAS FURTHER INCREASED. THE AIRLINE PERSONNEL SAID I SHOULD HAVE ROCKED MY WINGS; BUT HAD THEY BEEN GIVING ME A RED LIGHT; THIS WOULD'VE ACKNOWLEDGED IT; EVEN THOUGH I WAS STILL PROCEEDING IN FOR A LNDG. I DECIDED IT BETTER TO JUST PROCEED IN FOR AN OBVIOUS AND SLOW LNDG; AND GIVE THEM TIME TO ACCOUNT FOR IT.

THE FLT WAS TO BE AN APPROX 50 MIN XCOUNTRY PLEASURE TRIP WITH A PAX. THE ACFT WAS RESERVED WITH A BLOCK OF 3 HRS STARTING AT XA45. DURING PREFLT; WHILE CHKING THE TANKS VISUALLY; I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THE TANKS NOT TOPPED OFF AND ESTIMATED THE FUEL TO BE 2 INCHES BELOW THE FILLER HOLE OR APPROX 3/4 FULL. I RATIONALIZED THIS CONDITION BY POSSIBLY THE LINEMAN BEING IN A HURRY OR PERHAPS A SUMMER POLICY FOR ACFT PERFORMANCE. (THE OWNER OF THE FBO LATER STATED THAT HIS ACFT ARE OFTEN NOT TOPPED OFF FOR PERFORMANCE REASONS.) AFTER ENG START I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THE FUEL GAUGES INDICATING BTWN 1/4 AND 1/3 ON EACH TANK. I WAS CONCERNED ENOUGH TO MAKE SEVERAL COMMENTS TO MY PAX ABOUT THE ACCURACY OF THE GAUGES. AFTER A NORMAL RUN-UP TKOF AND ENRTE TO THE DEST I CONTINUED TO BE CONCERNED WITH THE FUEL GAUGE READING. I REVIEWED THE PERFORMANCE MANUAL SEVERAL TIMES TO CONFIRM MY RANGE AND ENDURANCE EVEN USING WORSE CASE OF THE GAUGES BEING ACCURATE. I SHOULD HAVE HAD ENOUGH FOR DEST. APPROX 4 MI FROM LNDG; WITH THE L TANK READING 'E' AND THE R TANK READING '1/4' THE ENG STOPPED. AN OFF ARPT LNDG WAS MADE IN A LARGE PASTURE. THE ENG CONTINUED TO IDLE AFTER COMING TO A STOP. UPON SECURING THE ACFT; I VISUALLY CHKED THE FUEL IN THE WINGS WITH THE L ONE HAVING APPROX 1/2 INCHES AND THE R ONE HAVING APPROX 2 INCHES. I RESTARTED THE ACFT AND TAXIED TO THE EDGE OF THE PASTURE BORDERED BY A GRAVEL ROAD. I CALLED; BY CELL PHONE; THE FBO AND ADVISED I HAD EXPERIENCED AN ENG FAILURE WHICH APPEARED TO BE FUEL RELATED BUT THAT THERE WAS FUEL IN THE ACFT. AT MY ORIGINAL DEST ARPT; APPROX 1 HR LATER; I MET THE RECOVERY ACFT WITH THE MECH AND FLEW TO THE PASTURE. AFTER CHKING THE DOWNED ACFT; THE MECH STATED THAT IT WAS OUT OF FUEL. I TRIED TO VERIFY THE AMOUNT OF FUEL WITH A SCREWDRIVER HANDLE AND FLASHLIGHT. AGAIN; I SAW 1/2 INCHES IN THE L TANK AND APPROX 2 INCHES OR MORE IN THE R TANK. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES; THE MECH AND I WERE NEVER ABLE TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON THE AMOUNT OF FUEL IN THE TANKS. AUTO FUEL WAS ADDED AND THE ACFT WAS FLOWN TO A NEARBY ARPT (TUP) AND TOPPED OFF. FLT WAS THEN CONTINUED TO THE ORIGINAL DEP ARPT. AFTER SPEAKING WITH SEVERAL MECHS; REVIEWING THE ACFT FLT MANUAL; STUDYING THE PHYSICAL SHAPE OF THE FUEL TANK AND CALCULATING THE FUEL ADDED MINUS THE FUEL BURN; I BELIEVE THE L TANK WAS EMPTY. (ALL I SAW WAS THE 'UNBURNABLE' .75 GALS.) THE R TANK HAD 1.5-2.0 GALS OF BURNABLE FUEL IN IT. I DO NOT KNOW WHY IT WOULD NOT FEED THE ENG.

I HAVE BEEN TAKING LESSONS AT FBO IN TEXAS SINCE JAN/98. I AM CHKED OUT BY MY INSTRUCTOR TO FLY SOLO IN THE AREA ON A C152. I USUALLY FLY VERY EARLY ABOUT ONCE A WK SO THAT I CAN MINIMIZE ANY DISRUPTIONS TO MY WORK SCHEDULE. I AM EMPLOYED FULL-TIME AND I AM ONLY TAKING FLYING LESSONS FOR RECREATIONAL PURPOSES. THE FBO HAS A LONG-STANDING AGREEMENT TO LEAVE THE KEYS IN THE PLANE FOR THOSE PLTS RESERVING A PLANE BEFORE THEIR OFFICE OPENS. ON APPROX JUN/AA/98; I RESERVED A C152 FOR JUN/DD/98 AT XA30. ON JUN/DD/98; I ARRIVED AT THE FIELD AT APPROX XA25; SAW THE HANGAR DOOR CLOSED AND THEN PROCEEDED TO THEIR C152 WHICH WAS PARKED ON THE RAMP. I PLANNED TO STAY IN TFC AND PRACTICE A FEW TKOFS AND LNDGS. ONCE I ARRIVED AND CLBED INTO THE CABIN; I FOUND THE KEY IN THE IGNITION. I OBTAINED THE CHKLIST FROM THE GLOVE BOX AND PERFORMED MY PREFLT CHKLIST. ALL ITEMS ON THE CHKLIST PASSED INCLUDING OUTSIDE VISUAL INSPECTIONS; OIL LEVEL CHK; AND OIL PRESSURE CHK. AFTER COMPLETING ALL BEFORE STARTING ENG AND STARTING ENG CHKLISTS; I TAXIED TO THE END OF THE RWY TO PERFORM MY BEFORE TKOF CHKLIST ITEMS. ALL ITEMS PASSED EXCEPT THE MAGNETO CHK. THE ACFT PASSED THE R MAGNETO CHK; BUT WHEN I SWITCHED TO THE L MAGNETO; THE PWR LEVEL STARTED DROPPING. I QUICKLY SWITCHED BACK TO THE 'BOTH' POS. I WAS UNAWARE THAT 1 OF THE 2 REDUNDANT MAGNETOS FAILING IS A GNDING CONDITION. ORIGINALLY; I BELIEVED ANY ITEM THAT FAILED ON THE PREFLT CHKLIST WAS A 'GNDING CONDITION;' HOWEVER; THIS ASSUMPTION WAS ERODED FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. ON ONE OF MY FIRST FLTS; DURING THE TIRE INSPECTION; THE TIRES SEEMED BALD -- SOME OF THE TREAD GROOVES HAD WORN COMPLETELY DOWN. HOWEVER; I WAS NOTIFIED BY FBO PERSONNEL THAT THE TIRE WAS OK. ON ANOTHER OCCASION DURING MY PREFLT CHKOUT; I NOTICED THAT THE XPONDER WAS NOT THERE. AFTER INFORMING FBO PERSONNEL THAT THE PLANE FAILED THE CHKLIST DUE TO THE XPONDER; THEY INDICATED THAT THE XPONDER WAS REMOVED FOR SVC AND UNDER CURRENT CONDITIONS; NOT REQUIRED AND THAT I WAS AUTH TO FLY. ON YET ANOTHER OCCASION; I WAS EXPERIENCING COM PROBS (ANOTHER PLT ALSO IN TFC DIDN'T SEEM TO HEAR MY RESPONSES). UPON IMMEDIATELY RETURNING TO THE HANGAR; FBO PERSONNEL INSPECTED AND VERIFIED MY RADIO; BUT SAID THAT REGARDLESS; UNDER CURRENT CONDITIONS; A RADIO IS NOT REQUIRED. FOR THESE REASONS; AND SINCE I WAS NOT AWARE THAT ONLY 1 BAD MAGNETO WAS A GNDING CONDITION; I PROCEEDED TO DEPART CAUTIOUSLY AND STAY IN TFC. ON MY SECOND DOWNWIND LEG; THE OIL PRESSURE STARTED DROPPING DRAMATICALLY AND I STARTED TO SMELL SMOKE IN THE CABIN. I WAS ABLE TO BRING THE PLANE DOWN ONTO THE RWY SAFELY. UPON EXITING THE AIRPLANE AT THE HANGAR; I NOTICED LARGE AMOUNTS OF OIL DRIPPING FROM THE COWLING AND ENG AREA. UPON RPTING THE INCIDENT IMMEDIATELY TO FBO PERSONNEL; THEY INDICATED TO ME THAT THE PLANE WAS DOWN FOR MAINT. APPARENTLY; THE DAY BEFORE; FBO PERSONNEL HAD PERFORMED MAINT ON THE AIRPLANE AND HAD REMOVED THE L MAGNETO. IN SUMMARY: 1) FBO PERSONNEL DID NOT CALL ME TO NOTIFY THAT THE PLANE WAS DOWN FOR MAINT EVEN THOUGH I WAS CLRLY LOGGED TO CHKOUT THE PLANE AT XA30. FBO HAS MY OFFICE; HOME AND PAGER NUMBERS; AND THE FORMER 2 HAVE VOICE MAIL. 2) NO MARKINGS OR IDENT WARNING THE PLANE WAS INOP. 3) THE KEY WAS LEFT IN THE PLANE. 4) THE PLANE WAS LEFT OUT ON THE RAMP.",,,,"SPI FLYING SOLO IN EARLY MORNING PRIOR TO OPENING OF FBO OFFICES EXPERIENCES A MAGNETO DROP BUT DOES NOT REALIZE THIS SHOULD GND THE ACFT.

THE RUNUP AND DEP FROM RWY 24 WERE UNEVENTFUL; WITH NORMAL CLB (70 KTS) AND PWR INDICATIONS. I CONTINUED A NORMAL CLB AFTER TURNING ONTO A NBOUND XWIND TO DEPART THE PATTERN. APPROX 2 MI FROM POU; I CONTACTED THE TWR AND REQUESTED A L-HAND 360 DEG CLBING TURN TO GAIN ALT PRIOR TO XING THE HUDSON RIVER. AFTER COMPLETING THE 360 DEG TURN; I CONTINUED NBOUND; PARALLELING THE HUDSON RIVER. APPROX 1 MI LATER; AT APPROX 2000 FT MSL; I HEARD A LOUD 'BANG' FROM THE ENG AND NOTICED AN IMMEDIATE DROP IN RPM ACCOMPANIED BY THE VIOLENT SHAKING OF THE ENG. I IMMEDIATELY TURNED BACK TOWARD POU AND SIMULTANEOUSLY NOTIFIED THE TWR THAT I WAS INBOUND AND REDUCED PWR TO A POINT AT WHICH THE ENG VIBRATIONS SUBSIDED SUFFICIENTLY TO CONTINUE FLT WITHOUT THE RISK OF DAMAGING THE ENG MOUNTS. WHILE I DID NOT NOTICE WHAT MY RPM WAS; I BELIEVE IT WAS IN THE 1200-1400 RPM RANGE. POU TWR INQUIRED IF I REQUIRED ANY ASSISTANCE. SINCE I WAS WELL WITHIN GLIDING DISTANCE AND HAD SOME PWR; I DECLINED ANY ASSISTANCE OTHER THAN AN EXPEDITED LNDG CLRNC. THERE WAS 1 OTHER ACFT IN CONTACT WITH POU; A C182 AGREED TO ALLOW ME TO LAND FIRST. SINCE I WAS DIRECTLY N OF THE ARPT; RWY 15 WAS CLOSEST. HOWEVER; SINCE I HAD SUFFICIENT ALT AND SOME PWR; I ELECTED TO LAND ON RWY 24; WHICH WAS 2000 FT LONGER AND HAD A VISUAL APCH SLOPE INDICATOR. APCH AND LNDG WERE UNEVENTFUL. THE ACFT HAD SUFFICIENT PWR TO TAXI BACK TO OUR TIE-DOWN. SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE #3 CYLINDER EXHAUST VALVE HAD BROKEN; WITH THE VALVE HEAD BECOMING IMPALED IN THE FACE OF THE PISTON. THE VALVE AND PISTON REQUIRED REPLACEMENT. THE LOWER ENG SUFFERED NO DAMAGE. A CRITIQUE OF MY PERFORMANCE LEADS ME TO THESE OBSERVATIONS: 1) I DID NOT DECLARE AN EMER SINCE I BELIEVED THROUGHOUT THE INCIDENT THAT I HAD SUFFICIENT ALT TO COMPLETE A PWR-OFF LNDG AT POU. HOWEVER; HAD THE ENG PROB WORSENED; OR HAD OTHER COMPLICATIONS DEVELOPED; I MIGHT HAVE REQUIRED EMER SERVICES. SINCE SECONDS COUNT IN AN EMER; I SHOULD HAVE DECLARED IT 'JUST IN CASE.' 2) MY DECISION TO PERFORM A CLBING 360 DEG TURN TO GAIN ALT GAVE ME A SAFETY CUSHION. I NOW SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF BEST-PERFORMANCE (VY) DEPS. EVERY FT OF ALT HELPS IN AN EMER. 3) DURING MY RETURN TO POU; MY AIRSPD OCCASIONALLY DEVIATED AS MUCH AS 10 KTS FROM THE BEST GLIDE SPD OF 60 KTS. WHILE THIS WAS NOT A FACTOR IN THIS INCIDENT; I NEED TO BE MORE FOCUSED ON PRECISELY MAINTAINING THE BEST GLIDE SPD TO MAXIMIZE MY LNDG OPTIONS.",,,,"PLT OF A C152 HEARS A LOUD BANG AND HAS LOSS OF RPM AND ENG VIBRATION.

DYR (MY DEST) WAS RPTING VISIBILITY OF 10 MI WITH A FEW CLOUDS AT 3100 FT. THERE WAS SOME HAZE AS THERE HAS BEEN MOST OF THE SUMMER. I CONSULTED WITH MY CFI AND FILED A VFR FLT PLAN. I DO NOT HAVE MY FLT PLAN FORM WITH ME SO THESE TIMES WILL BE FROM MEMORY. I GOT WX FOR VFR FLT AT XA30. I DID MY PREFLT AND CALLED FOR A TOP UP OF FUEL.

HOWEVER; THE FUEL WAS WITHIN 1 - 1 1/2 INCHES OF THE TOP SO THERE WAS MORE THAN ENOUGH FUEL FOR MY PLANNED 45-60 MIN FLT WITH A SLIGHT TAILWIND. A STICK GAUGE WAS NOT AVAILABLE.

BTWN ARPTS M04 AND DYR; I DRIFTED ABOUT 2 MI R. I BELIEVE THIS BECAUSE I FLEW OVER WHAT I THINK WAS ARNOLD; A PVT ARPT. HOWEVER; AT THE TIME I THOUGHT I HAD HAPPENED UPON AN UNCHARTED CROP DUSTING ARPT SO I DID NOT MAKE A COURSE CORRECTION. THIS CAUSED ME TO PASS 2-3 NM TO THE R OF DYR. I FLEW OVER DYERSBURG AND REALIZED I HAD MISSED THE ARPT. I CALLED JACKSON FSS FOR A 15 MIN EXTENSION ON MY FLT PLAN.

I SAID I WAS AND THEY ASKED ME TO RADIO WHEN I GOT ON THE GND. BY THIS TIME I WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED BECAUSE I HAD NEVER HAD A PLANE UP SO LONG. I DECIDED TO FLY A LITTLE TO THE N TO MAKE SURE I HAD HIT THE MAIN PORTION OF DYERSBURG. WHEN I WAS SURE I HAD; I DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO TUNE TO THE MKL VOR AND FLY THERE BEFORE FUEL GOT TOO LOW.

ZME GAVE ME RADAR VECTORS TO DYR AND I WAS ON THE GND BY XD45. I RADIOED FSS TO TELL THEM I WAS ON THE GND. I REFUELED AT DYR AND FILED A VFR FLT PLAN FOR RETURN TO MEMPHIS. FSS DID EXPRESS SOME CONCERN ABOUT ME; BUT I ASSURED THEM THAT I HAD COMPLETED MY REQUIRED NIGHT AND NIGHT XCOUNTRY AND WOULD BE FINE. I DID CONSULT MY INSTRUCTOR TO MAKE SURE HE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON. HE GOT A WX BRIEF FOR ME. I ACTIVATED MY FLT PLAN AND TOOK OFF. I REQUESTED AND RECEIVED FLT FOLLOWING FROM MEMPHIS APCH. I WAS CLRED INTO CLASS B AND ASKED TO RPT OLV IN SIGHT. THE FLT WENT WITHOUT INCIDENT AND I WAS AT OLV IN LESS THAN 1 HR. THERE WERE SEVERAL PROBS HERE.

I STEERED THE PLANE BACK TOWARD THE CTRLINE BY APPLYING EASY L RUDDER TO AVOID GETTING OFF OF THE RWY. THE SPD WAS TOO LOW (AROUND 40 KTS) TO APPLY FULL PWR AND IT WAS TOO RISKY. THE PLANE NOW HAD 1 WHEEL ON THE GRASS AND 1 WHEEL ON THE RWY. EARLIER THAT MORNING; IT WAS RAINING; THEREFORE; I DID NOT APPLY TOO MUCH PRESSURE TO THE BRAKES BECAUSE THE GRASS WAS WET AND THE PLANE WOULD SKID. I LIFTED THE NOSE UP UNTIL THE PLANE STOPPED BTWN 20-30 FT FROM THE RWY WITH NO PROB. I CHKED MY STUDENT AND FOR TFC; THERE WAS NO TFC IN SIGHT; AND I PROCEEDED BACK TO THE RWY WHICH WAS APPROX 4 - 4 1/2 INCHES HIGHER THAN THE GND. I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THIS BECAUSE THE GRASS WAS TOO HIGH. THIS CAUSED THE NOSEWHEEL TO SWING TO THE R AND HIT AGAINST THE 4 - 4 1/2 INCH SHOULDER OF THE RWY. I SHUT OFF THE ENG AND CHKED OUT THE PROB. I FOUND OUT THAT THE FENDER (COWL) ON THE NOSEWHEEL WAS BROKEN. WE THEN LIFTED THE NOSE UP ON THE PLANE AND PUSHED IT ONTO THE RWY. I RESTARTED THE ENG; CHKED THE TFC AND RETURNED THE PLANE TO THE RAMP AND THEN TO THE HANGAR. I THEN INFORMED THE MECH ON DUTY OF THE PROB AND THE SIT AT HAND.",,,,"C152 INSTRUCTOR AND TRAINEE WENT OFF THE RWY ON LNDG.",

I PROMPTLY TURNED 45 DEGS TO THE N AND CROSSED THE RWY AROUND THE 1/4 END OF THE N END OF RWY 17/35. AS I CROSSED THE RWY I CALLED L DOWNWIND FOR RWY 17. SHORTLY THEREAFTER THE PLT FLYING THE JUMP PLANE CALLED DOWNWIND FOR RWY 26. I SAW THE JUMP PLANE 1 NM SE OF THE FIELD AT THE SAME ALT I WAS AT. I DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE APCH AND DID A STOP-AND-GO ON RWY 17. AFTER SEEING THAT THE JUMPER WAS ON THE GND AND THAT NO OTHER JUMPERS WERE IN THE AIR; I DEPARTED RWY 17. I CLBED OUT ON THE RWY HDG FOR 2 NM AND DEPARTED THE PATTERN TO THE W. WHEN I WAS 5 NM W OF THE FIELD THE PLT FLYING THE JUMP PLANE MADE A RADIO CALL ASKING IF ANYONE HAD GOTTEN THE TAIL NUMBER OF THE ACFT THAT JUST DID A TOUCH-AND-GO AT CUH. HE STATED THAT THE PLANE HAD FLOWN INTO HIS JUMP ZONE AND CUT HIM OFF ON DOWNWIND. I DIDN'T REPLY AND CONTINUED BACK TO SWO.

I WAS MAKING ALL MY RADIO CALLS ON CUH UNICOM FREQ 122.8. THE PLT OF THE JUMP PLANE WAS ALSO USING CUH UNICOM FREQ OF 122.8.

THE DIMENSIONS OF THE PRACTICE AREA ARE SHOWN ON THE ENCLOSED COPY FROM THE LAX TAC. THE RED LINE FROM SNA TO THE NEWPORT PRACTICE AREA DENOTES THE APPROX COURSE OF OUR ACFT. THE GREEN HIGHLIGHTER DEPICTS THE APPROX BOUNDARIES OF THE PRACTICE AREA. LASTLY; THE RED CIRCLE FILLED IN WITH YELLOW HIGHLIGHTER DENOTES THE APPROX POS OF THE MIDAIR. THE C152 WE WERE FLYING ORIGINATED FROM SNA FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRAINING TOWARDS MY CFI RATING. THE CREW INCLUDED MYSELF AND A CFI OF 6 YRS FROM THE LCL FBO. THE GOAL OF THE FLT WAS FOR ME TO TEACH STALLS AND MCA TO THE CFI FOR EXPERIENCE TOWARDS MY CFI RATING. I CONTACTED SNA CLRNC AT AROUND XA00 AND REQUESTED A 'NEWPORT 150 DEG DEP TO THE PRACTICE AREA.' THIS DEP TAKES US OUT TO OUR NORMAL PRACTICE AREA BUT RESTRICTS US TO BELOW 2500 FT MSL UNTIL WE CONTACT SOCAL DEP. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT DEPICTED ON EITHER THE LAX TAC OR THE LAX SECTIONAL; MOST CTLRS ARE AWARE OF THE AREA. WE LIFTED OFF RWY 19L AT ABOUT XA45 AND AT ABOUT 1300 FT MSL WE WERE HANDED OFF TO RADAR ADVISORIES ON 128.35. I CONTACTED ADVISORIES AND THEY CONFIRMED MY POS 3 MI SE OF THE ARPT. AT ABOUT 2100 FT; RADAR ADVISORIES SAID 'CESSNA XXX CONTACT SOCAL DEP ON 128.1 AND IF THEY DO NOT RESPOND; SQUAWK VFR OVER THE SHORELINE AND RESUME OWN NAV.' I CONTACTED SOCAL AND THEY RESPONDED THEY HAD ME IN RADAR CONTACT. I THEN REQUESTED WE WOULD LIKE TO MANEUVER AT OR BELOW 4000 FT IN 'THE PRACTICE AREA.' SOCAL CLRED US TO AT OR BELOW 4000 FT. THIS WAS THE LAST XMISSION FROM SOCAL WE HEARD FOR US UNTIL JUST BEFORE THE MIDAIR. HOWEVER; AS I PASSED THE SHORELINE I MADE THE MISTAKE OF SQUAWKING VFR. WHY I DID THIS I AM NOT QUITE SURE. I THINK IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS ONE OF THE LAST THINGS I HEARD FROM RADAR ADVISORIES. ALTHOUGH I HAD PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH THE AREA (ABOUT 5 YRS AGO) THIS WAS MY SECOND TIME TO THE PRACTICE AREA SINCE THEN. I THINK I WAS JUST CONFUSED ABOUT RADAR ADVISORIES TELLING ME TO SQUAWK VFR IF SOCAL DID NOT RESPOND. THE CFI ON BOARD DID NOT CATCH MY MISTAKE OF SQUAWKING VFR PASSING THE SHORELINE EITHER. SO WE CONTINUED UP TO 3000 FT TO PERFORM MINIMUM CTL AIRSPD AND STALLS WHILE STILL MONITORING SOCAL DEP CTL. (NOTE: SOME OF OUR PRACTICE AREA INCLUDED CLASS C AIRSPACE. THIS IS WHY WE FREQUENTLY REQUEST A 'DEP' SINCE WE WILL BE DOING SOME MANEUVERING WITHIN THE CLASS C AIRSPACE.) CONTRIBUTING FACTOR #1: I SHOULD HAVE NOT SQUAWKED 1200 PASSING THE SHORELINE. THIS TELLS THE CTLR THAT I DO NOT WANT ADVISORIES ANY MORE EVEN IF I DID NOT SAY IT VERBALLY OVER THE RADIO. CONTRIBUTING FACTOR #2: SINCE I ASSUMED WE WERE STILL CLRED IN CLASS C AT OR BELOW 4000 FT WE CONTINUED IN AND OUT OF THE AIRSPACE. AFTER ABOUT 20 MINS OF MANEUVERING IN OUR NORMAL PRACTICE AREA (IN AND OUT OF CLASS C) SOCAL DEP CONTACTED US AND ASKED US IF WE HAD CANCELED RADAR SVC. ABOUT 3 SECONDS LATER DURING THE CONVERSATION WITH THE CTLR A C152 FILLED OUR WINDSCREEN ABOUT 150 FT BELOW AND 100 FT TO THE R OF US. THE ACFT APPEARED TO BE A C152 OR C172. IT WAS MAKING A HARD L TURN AND AT THAT MOMENT I ALSO REACTED WITH A HARD L TURN. I DO NOT REMEMBER WHAT I SAID TO THE CTLR AFTER THE NEAR MIDAIR. MY INSTRUCTOR TOLD ME THAT I HAD ANSWERED YES TO THE QUESTION IF I HAD CANCELED RADAR SVC. SOCAL THEN ASSIGNED ME A XPONDER CODE AND WE RESUMED OUR MINIMUM CTL AIRSPD AND STALL WORK. OUR HDG DURING THE NEAR MIDAIR WAS ABOUT 300 DEGS. WE WERE AT 3000 FT PERFORMING STALL WORK. THE OTHER ACFT WAS ON ABOUT A 130 DEG HDG. CONTRIBUTING FACTOR #3: WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW MORE. HOWEVER; JUST BEFORE WE SAW THE ACFT WE WERE AT A HIGH ANGLE OF ATTACK SO OUR VISIBILITY WAS RESTR DIRECTLY AHEAD OF US. I REALIZE I WAS AT FAULT BY SQUAWKING VFR. EVEN THOUGH I DID NOT SAY ANYTHING ON THE RADIO ABOUT THIS; MY INSTRUCTOR NOTED THAT SQUAWKING 1200 IS AS GOOD AS CANCELING RADAR SVC. THE CTLR HAD OBVIOUSLY BEEN MONITORING US AND HAD GOTTEN A TFC CONFLICT ON HIS SCREEN JUST BEFORE HE CONTACTED US ON THE RADIO. MY INSTRUCTOR ALSO SAID THAT THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. I DID NOT INQUIRE WHAT HE MEANT BY SAYING 'ALL THE TIME.' BUT THIS DOES DISTURB ME IF THIS IS TRUE. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY MIDAIR'S HAVE OCCURRED IN THIS PRACTICE AREA BUT I WOULD LIKE TO BE PRO-ACTIVE ABOUT THE SIT. I PLAN TO BRING IT UP TO THE OWNER OF THE LCL FBO AND ASK HIM WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT THE SIT. I DO ADMIT THAT SQUAWKING 1200 PASSING THE SHORELINE WAS POOR JUDGEMENT ON MY PART AND I DO NOT PLAN ON LETTING IT HAPPENING AGAIN. AIRSPACE WAS OBVIOUSLY VIOLATED TOO SINCE I WAS VFR AND NOT RECEIVING RADAR ADVISORIES. I DID NOT REALIZE THIS UNTIL THE CTLR QUESTIONED ME ABOUT MY POS AND THEN THE NEAR MIDAIR OCCURRED. THE CTLR MENTIONED NOTHING ABOUT OUR AIRSPACE VIOLATION AND DID NOT CONTACT US AFTER WE HAD LANDED.",,,,"A C152 AND ANOTHER CESSNA ACFT HAD AN NMAC IN THE NEWPORT BEACH PRACTICE AREA.",

THE REASON I TOOK THIS ACFT (AN SMA) WAS SO I WOULD NOT HAVE TO REFUEL. I FLEW TO EAG AND STOPPED FOR ROUGHLY 15 MINS. BEFORE I TOOK OFF; I FILED A NEW FLT PLAN AND THEN PREFLTED MY ACFT. I FORGOT TO VISUALLY INSPECT THE TANKS; BUT EVERYTHING ELSE WAS DONE. THE FLT BACK; I CRUISED AT 4500 FT; FLEW OVER THE CITY OF OMAHA; AND THEN I NOTICED MY FUEL GAUGES. I DID A QUICK MENTAL CHK ON HOW MUCH TIME I HAD LEFT. I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT EACH TANK HELD 18 GALLONS OF FUEL. EACH TANK READ BTWN EMPTY AND 1/4. I TRIED TO FIGURE HOW MANY GALLONS WERE LEFT. I ROUNDED DOWN FOR 1/4 OF A TANK AND GOT 4 GALLONS; SO THEN I TOOK MY E6B AND PLUGGED IN THE WIND; MY HDG; AND HOW MUCH GAS I HAD LEFT. I GUESSED THAT I HAD 4 GALLONS TOTAL FUEL REMAINING. IF THIS WERE TRUE; THEN I WOULD HAVE PLENTY OF GAS TO MAKE IT TO LINCOLN. I WAS HANDED OFF TO LINCOLN APCH FROM OMAHA AND I ASKED FOR AN IMMEDIATE NO DELAY LNDG. ABOUT 5 MINS LATER; MY ENG SPUTTERED AND I ASKED APCH (LNK) FOR AN ALTERNATE ARPT.

WHILE ENRTE TO LNK; HE ENCOUNTERED FUEL STARVATION WHICH CAUSED HIM TO EXECUTE AN EMER OFF ARPT LNDG; WHICH AFTER INSPECTION BY IA MECH; WAS FOUND TO BE WITHOUT ANY DAMAGE. COMMENTED THAT ALTHOUGH HE DIDN'T VISUALLY INSPECT THE AMOUNT OF FUEL IN HIS TANKS AT EAG HIS GAUGES WERE REGISTERING GREATER THAN 1/2 HIS FUEL REMAINED. WHILE ENRTE AND OVER MLE; HE WAS AWARE THAT HIS FUEL INDICATED LESS THAN 1/4 FUEL REMAINED IN EACH L AND R TANKS. PRIOR TO HIS FUEL RUNNING OUT; HE REQUESTED PRIORITY HANDLING BY LNK ATC. WHEN HIS ENG QUIT; HE WAS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING VECTORED BY ATC TO EPG. UNABLE TO IDENT THE GRASS RWY AT EPG; EXECUTED AN OFF ARPT LNDG. EVENTS THAT LED TO HIS FUEL STARVATION INCLUDE: 1) THE ACFT HAD A WING PLACARD INDICATING THAT IT HELD 18 GALLONS IN THE R TANK (WHICH WAS MUCH MORE VISIBLE AND PLACED OVER THE FADED PAINTED PLACARD INDICATING 13 GALLONS). ALTHOUGH THE L WING WAS MISSING AN 18 GALLON PLACARD; IT DID HAVE A 13 GALLON FADED PAINTED PLACARD.

AFTER GETTING OUT TO THE AIRPLANE I VISUALLY CHKED EVERYTHING; MAKING SURE THE FUEL WAS FULL AND THE CAPS WERE ON; IF THERE WAS SUFFICIENT OIL; ETC. AFTER LOOKING THE PLANE OVER EVERYTHING WAS OK AND CHKED OUT. THE FUEL GAUGES INDICATED FULL AND THEY WERE VISUALLY FULL. AFTER THE PREFLT CHKS I DEPARTED CARBONDALE TO THE S. I WAS UNABLE TO CONTACT FSS; DUE TO NO RESPONSE SO I ASKED TWR TO ACTIVATE THE VFR FLT PLAN. THE FIRST LEG WAS CARBONDALE TO DYERSBURG WHICH TOOK A LITTLE OVER AN HR. AFTER LNDG AT DYR AND RESTING FOR 15 MINS; I TOOK OFF ON RWY 16. UPON CHKING THE GAS GAUGES WITH A READING OF 3/4 IN EACH TANK; I PROCEEDED ON TO THE NEXT LEG. DURING LEG 2; I WAS ONCE AGAIN ON WITH ZME ALL THE WAY TO MADISONVILLE. AFTER REACHING MADISONVILLE IN 1 1/2 HRS; I FELT THAT THERE WAS SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF FUEL FOR THE FINAL LEG AND EXECUTED A TOUCH-AND-GO AT MADISONVILLE USING RWY 23. AFTER DEPARTING THE MADISONVILLE AREA; AND READING THE GAS GAUGE; I HAD A HAIR UNDER 1/2 TANK OF GAS IN EACH TANK; WHICH IS AMPLE AMOUNT TO GET ME TO CARBONDALE APPROX 105 MI; REQUIRING 6 GALLONS; WHICH IS LESS THAN 1/2 A TANK. AFTER GETTING TO ELDARADO STILL WITH A LITTLE UNDER 1/2 TANKS; THE FUEL INDICATORS DROPPED TO ZERO WITHIN 2 MINS. DUE TO MY 4 YRS OF PREVIOUS FLYING EXPERIENCE; I KNEW THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG BECAUSE YOU DON'T LOSE FUEL THAT FAST. I VISUALLY LOOKED TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY FUEL COMING OUT OF THE AIRPLANE BUT DID NOT SEE ANY. THE ENG THEN BEGAN SPUTTERING; AND LOST PWR; THEN GAINED PWR. AS I WAS STILL ON WITH ZKC; I DECLARED AN EMER. ZKC WAS ATTEMPTING TO GET ME TO HARRISBURG; WHICH THEY STATED WAS 8 MI SW OF ME. THE ENG WAS GETTING WORSE AND INFORMED CTR THAT I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE THE ARPT. SHORTLY AFTER THAT; I WAS SWITCHED TO A DIFFERENT FREQ AND DID NOT HEAR FROM THEM AGAIN. AT THE ALT OF 1500 FT THE ENG STOPPED. I HAD ONE FIELD THAT I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE. THE FIELD WAS SOMEWHAT MUDDY; BUT I WAS ABLE TO SAFELY LAND THE AIRPLANE WITHOUT DAMAGE TO THE ACFT OR MYSELF. I FEEL THAT THOUGH NO FUEL WAS RECEIVED THROUGHOUT THE TRIP THAT FROM PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE THAT I HAD ENOUGH TO GET ME WHERE I NEEDED TO GO. THE SUDDEN LOSS OF THE FUEL WAS CONFUSING SINCE I KNOW THERE IS NO WAY TO LOSE THAT MUCH FUEL THAT FAST. I FEEL VERY FORTUNATE THAT THE TRAINING I RECEIVED ON EMERS REALLY CAME THROUGH FOR ME DURING THIS TIME. THIS INCIDENT ALSO HELPED BUILD UP MY SELF ESTEEM IN THAT IN THE EVENT OF AN EMER OF ANY NATURE THAT I AM ABLE TO HANDLE IT AND BRING THE PLANE DOWN SAFETY. ALTHOUGH I WASN'T SURE IF I WANTED TO GET BACK IN A PLANE AFTER THIS; I WAS JUST SHAKEN UP. I LOVE TO FLY AND WANT TO DO THAT AS A CAREER. THIS WAS DEFINITELY A LEARNING EXPERIENCE; IN WHICH I LEARNED THE IMPORTANCE OF INSURING THE SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF NECESSARY NEEDS AT EACH STOP.

AT THIS TIME I WAS MONITORING FLT SVC AFTER ACTIVATING THE FLT PLAN. WHEN I CROSSED THE MOUNTAIN RANGE W OF LAS VEGAS; I ENCOUNTERED SOME MODERATE TURB. I HAD SOME ITEMS IN THE STORAGE AREA BEHIND THE SEAT (A CAMERA; OIL; SMALL LADDER). I TURNED AROUND TO SEE IF EVERYTHING WAS OK. I STARTED DSNDING TO GET BELOW 4000 FT BEFORE I GOT TOO CLOSE TO LAS VEGAS. I WAS REALLY STARTING TO WORRY ABOUT HAVING ENOUGH FUEL TO GET THERE. TRIED CALLING HENDERSON; NO RESPONSE. AFTER NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS; THEN MY RADIO WAS NOT WORKING. I LEVELED OFF ABOUT 3200-3300 FT MSL. I WAS MORE WORRIED THEN THAT THE ENG WAS GOING TO STOP. THE WINDS WERE FORECAST TO BE LIGHT AND I THOUGHT THE RWY 18 WOULD BE IN USE. I KNEW THAT THEY USED R TFC FOR RWY 18. WHEN I FINALLY LOCATED THE ARPT; I SAW NO OTHER ACFT IN THE AREA TO GIVE ME A CLUE AS TO WHAT WAS WHAT. I DECIDED TO ENTER THE PATTERN ON AN EXTENDED BASE FOR RWY 18. WHEN I GOT CLOSE ENOUGH I SAW AN ACFT ON THE RWY FOR TKOF. THEY WERE USING RWY 36. I CROSSED OVER INTO XWIND R TFC. I WAS REALLY NERVOUS AND AFRAID THAT THE ENG WAS GOING TO STOP AND THERE WAS NOWHERE TO GO EXCEPT TO THE RWY. AT THIS POINT; ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS GETTING ON THE GND SAFELY. BY THIS TIME I HAD TO TURN BASE TO FINAL. SO I CLRED FINAL OF ANY INCOMING ACFT; AND MADE THE APCH. 2 ACFT WERE WAITING TO TAKE THE ACTIVE WHEN I TURNED FINAL (ABOUT 1/4 MI -- COULD BE LESS). I LANDED AND EXITED THE RWY. I WAS AT LEAST SAFE; BUT HIGHLY NERVOUS AND SHOOK UP. AFTER PARKING THE ACFT; I WENT TO THE OFFICE TO CLOSE THE FLT PLAN AND GET FUEL. AFTER A CONVERSATION WITH THE TWR OPERATOR AND TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED; I WENT BACK TO THE ACFT TO SEE IF I COULD SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO THE RADIO. I DISCOVERED THE MIKE AND PHONE JACKS WERE PULLED LOOSE. I MUST HAVE ACCIDENTALLY DONE IT WHEN I TURNED AROUND TO EXAMINE THE STORAGE AREA EARLIER. I WAS SOMEWHAT NUMB AT THIS POINT. I WENT BACK TO THE OFFICE AND CONTACTED THE TWR OPERATOR AS TO WHAT I HAD FOUND. HE EXPLAINED TO ME WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE WITH NO RADIO. I JUST DIDN'T THINK -- ALL I COULD SEE WAS THE ENG STOPPING; AND JUST WANTED TO GET ON THE GND. AFTER THE PLANE WAS FUELED AND THE FLT PLAN MADE TO MY HOME BASE; AND STILL VERY UNNERVED; I TOOK OFF; MADE A L DOWNWIND DEP AND RETURNED TO MY HOME BASE.

APCH ASKED US IF WE COULD PROCEED VFR; DUE TO WORKLOAD. SINCE VFR CONDITIONS PREVAILED; WE REPLIED 'YES.' WX WAS ABOUT 6 MI VISIBILITY IN SLIGHT HAZE AND A DARK VFR NIGHT. UNDER VFR ADVISORIES FROM DAYTONA APCH; WE REQUESTED HOLDING OVER DELAND NDB FOLLOWED BY THE NDB 30 APCH TO DELAND ARPT. WE WERE ISSUED HOLDING INSTRUCTIONS; HOLD SE OF DELAND; 314 DEG COURSE TO; EXPECT FURTHER CLRNC XX45Z. AT APPROX XX30Z APR/XA/99; WE WERE OUTBOUND IN THE HOLDING PATTERN IN A SE DIRECTION AT 2500 FT. DAYTONA RPTED TFC ABOUT 1 MI W OF OUR POS AT 2500 FT. I RPTED THE TFC IN SIGHT. THE ACFT (C172) WAS TRAVELING IN A NW DIRECTION AWAY FROM US AND APPEARED TO BE NO FACTOR. WE TURNED INBOUND IN THE HOLDING PATTERN AT 2500 FT; NOW IN A NW DIRECTION. WE PROCEEDED TO TRY AND TRACK INBOUND AND DISCUSSED IF WE WERE ON COURSE. AS WE CROSSED THE STATION; MY STUDENT STARTED A STANDARD RATE TURN TO THE R FOR THE OUTBOUND LEG OF HOLDING. I OBSERVED THE OTHER ACFT'S C172 GREEN NAV LIGHT AND LNDG LIGHT AT ABOUT MY 10 O'CLOCK POS. I TOOK CTL OF MY ACFT AND INCREASED THE BANK AND STARTED A DSCNT. I LEVELED OFF AT 2100 FT APPROX; ON A HDG OF 030 DEGS AND SEARCHED FOR THE OTHER ACFT C172. I OBSERVED THE ACFT BEHIND AND TO MY R SO I STARTED TO CLB BACK TO ASSIGNED ALT AND TURN TO CONTINUE THE HOLDING PATTERN. C172 WAS NOT ISSUED A RADIO CALL TO NOTIFY THEM THAT WE WERE HOLDING OVER DELAND AT 2500 FT; OR TO OUR POS. C172 WAS UNDER VFR ADVISORIES FROM DAYTONA APCH EXECUTING THE 18 DME TO THE ILS RWY 7L AT DAYTONA BEACH ARPT.

ONCE ESTABLISHED ON FINAL; MY STUDENT MADE A SLIP TO LNDG DUE TO A SLIGHTLY HIGH APCH. AFTER XING THE APCH END OF THE RWY; THE ACFT WAS IN A SLIGHTLY FAST (AT 75-80 KTS); BUT STABILIZED LEVELOFF OVER THE RWY. AT THIS TIME; I WAS STRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING CTRLINE ALIGNMENT. WE WERE TO THE L OF CTRLINE SO MY STUDENT MADE THE NECESSARY AILERON AND RUDDER INPUTS TO THE R TO CORRECT. AT THIS TIME I WOULD ESTIMATE OUR POS TO BE 5-10 FT L OF CTRLINE; AND AT 5 FT ABOVE THE RWY. AT THAT MOMENT (OR VERY SHORTLY THEREAFTER; THE ACFT VIOLENTLY BEGAN TO YAW (MORE SO THAN ROLL) AND ROLL TO THE R; AND SINK TO THE RWY. AS SOON AS THE ACFT BEGAN TO YAW; I TOOK CTL OF THE ACFT AND ADDED FULL PWR; L RUDDER; AND L AILERON. THE ACFT STRUCK THE RWY AT LEAST AT A 45-60 DEG ANGLE (LONGITUDINAL AXIS OF THE AIRPLANE RELATIVE TO THE RWY HDG) CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE TAIL AND R WINGTIP (WE DID NOT KNOW THAT WE HAD STRUCK ANY SURFACE OF THE ACFT OTHER THAN THE MAIN GEAR). ALTHOUGH THE CTLS SEEMED TO BE FAIRLY INEFFECTIVE; I EVENTUALLY WAS ABLE TO GET THE ACFT ALIGNED WITH THE RWY. ALTHOUGH WE WERE ALIGNED WITH THE RWY; WE WERE ON THE FAR R EDGE OF IT. I COULD SEE US HDG STRAIGHT FOR THE RWY EDGE IDENT LIGHTS (AND MANY OBSTACLES OFF OF THE RWY). I KNEW WE WERE RUNNING OUT OF RWY AND DETERMINED THAT IT WOULD BE SAFER TO BE IN THE AIR THAN ON THE GND. I NOTED THAT MY AIRSPD WAS 45-50 KTS. AT THAT AIRSPD; I COULD HANDLE THE AIRPLANE BETTER IN THE AIR THAN ON THE GND. SO I APPLIED 10 DEGS OF FLAPS; ROTATED INTO GND EFFECT; ACCELERATED TO 60 KTS; AND PROCEEDED TO GO AROUND. ONCE THE ACFT WAS AIRBORNE AND STABILIZED; I RETURNED FOR LNDG. MY ESTIMATION OF THE TIME ELAPSED BTWN THE INITIAL YAW; AND THE TIME WE GOT AIRBORNE WAS 5-10 SECONDS. SYNOPSIS: TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE; WE ENCOUNTERED A HORIZ WINDSHEAR. TO THE BEST OF MY UNDERSTANDING; WE WENT FROM HAVING A STRAIGHT HEADWIND TO A L QUARTERING TAILWIND. I BELIEVE 2 THINGS HAPPENED. FIRST; THE GUST FROM THE L LIFTED THE L WING UP. SECONDLY; THE SUDDEN SHIFT FROM A HEADWIND TO A TAILWIND REDUCED THE EFFECTIVE AIRFLOW OVER THE WING AND CTL SURFACES AT OR BELOW STALING SPDS. THUS THE ACFT MAY HAVE STALLED AND POSSIBLY ENTERED AN INITIAL SPIN. BEING SO CLOSE TO THE RWY; IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RECOVER FROM THE HIGH RATE OF SINK. I BELIEVE THAT I FLEW THE AIRPLANE THE BEST IT COULD BE FLOWN FOR THE CONDITIONS AT HAND. HAD I NOT REACTED QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY; THE ACFT WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE CARTWHEELED DOWN THE RWY RESULTING IN THE LOSS OF THE AIRPLANE AND POSSIBLY OUR LIVES.",,,,"A LNDG C152 EXPERIENCES A WINDSHEAR AND LOSS OF ACFT CTL.

THE ENG STARTED AND WE RETURNED TO BASE. IN A DISCUSSION WITH THE SCHOOL'S MECH WE AGREED: 1) WHEN GLIDING AT THE BEST GLIDE SPD OF 60 KTS THE PROP DOES NOT ROTATE AND FUEL IS NOT METERED FROM THE CARB SO THE RESTART PROC WILL FAIL. 2) THE CESSNA POH FOR THE C152; C172 AND C182 CALLS FOR THE PRIMER TO BE IN AND LOCKED IN ENG OUT CIRCUMSTANCES. 3) UPON DISASSEMBLY; THE CARB WAS FOUND TO BE IN GOOD ORDER.

AT APPROX MIDFIELD POINT I TURNED AT 45 DEG ENTRY TO DOWNWIND; ANNOUNCED; AND ENTERED PATTERN. AT 2 MI E POINT; I ANNOUNCED POS IN RESPONSE TO A CESSNA CARDINAL PURPORTING TO BE ON MIDFIELD DOWNWIND. MY ALT AT THE 2 MI POINT WAS 2300 FT MSL; 200 FT ABOVE PATTERN ALT. I CONTINUED TO DSND TO PATTERN ALT OF 2100 THEN TURNED R TO DOWNWIND. I ESTABLISHED DOWNWIND WHILE CONTINUING TO SEARCH FOR THE CARDINAL. THE CARDINAL THEN BROADCAST SHE WAS ENTERING A L BASE FOR 17. I CONTINUED DOWNWIND AND FINALLY SPOTTED THE PLANE AT LEAST 4 MI NE OF THE ARPT -- AN UNUSUALLY WIDE L BASE. THE CARDINAL TURNED A LONG FINAL. I EXTENDED MY DOWNWIND TURN UNTIL PAST THE CARDINAL; WHO WAS THEN ON FINAL. I ANNOUNCED AND THEN TURNED L BASE AND SUBSEQUENTLY FINAL. THE CARDINAL TAXIED SLOWLY BUT FINALLY CLRED THE RWY WHEN I WAS AT LEAST 1 MI OUT. THE LNDG WAS UNEVENTFUL; AND I CLRED THE RWY AND TAXIED TO THE GAS PUMPS. AT THAT POINT THE MALE AND FEMALE FROM THE CARDINAL CAME OVER TO MY ACFT AND ASKED TO TALK TO ME. (IN ALL SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATION THE MALE DID MOST OF THE TALKING THOUGH THE FEMALE WAS THE ONLY VOICE ON THE CARDINAL'S RADIO. THEY NEVER MADE IT CLR WHO THE PIC WAS DURING THEIR FLT.)  HE INQUIRED IF I HAD SEEN HIS ACFT; AND I STATED YES; ON AN EXTREMELY WIDE L BASE BUT NOT BEFORE. HE THEN CLAIMED THAT ON HIS DOWNWIND WE HAD NEARLY COLLIDED AND HE HAD TAKEN EVASIVE ACTION BY DIVING. HE FOLLOWED BY STATING THAT I HAD NEARLY HIT THE CARDINAL AS IT WAS FLYING THE DOWNWIND AND I HAD APCHED FROM THE NE. I COUNTERED THAT I HAD ARRIVED FROM THE NE BUT HAD ENTERED THE PATTERN CORRECTLY BY TURNING W TOWARD THE RWY THEN TURNING AGAIN ON A 45 DEG ANGLE TO ENTER A DOWNWIND AND ANNOUNCING EVERY TURN. IF OUR ACFT HAD INDEED BEEN NEAR EACH OTHER; THE CARDINAL WAS AT LEAST 1-2 MI OUTSIDE THE NORMAL L-HAND DOWNWIND AS FLOWN AT B24. ADDITIONALLY; AT THE PURPORTED POINT OF THE INCIDENT; I WAS STILL 200 FT ABOVE THE PATTERN ALT DSNDING TO BE ESTABLISHED AT THE CORRECT PATTERN ALT (2100 FT) AT THE NORMAL DOWNWIND ENTRY POINT. THE OTHER ACFT; THEREFORE; WAS NOT IN EITHER THE CORRECT POS FOR DOWNWIND AS THEY HAD BROADCAST NOR AT THE CORRECT ALT. ALSO AT THIS TIME THERE WAS GLIDER ACTIVITY AT THE ARPT; ONE OF WHICH I SPOTTED OVERHEAD AS I ENTERED THE DOWNWIND. THE GLIDER ENTERED THE PATTERN AND WAS ABLE TO COMPLETE A PATTERN BEFORE THE CARDINAL COMPLETED THE TURN TO FINAL. FURTHER DISCUSSION ENSUED; AND I QUERIED THE OTHER PLT IF HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE OPERATIONAL PROC AT B24. HE CLAIMED TO BE A TENANT AT THE ARPT WITH 'EVERY RATING' AND 'THOUSANDS OF HRS.' I EXPLAINED THE STANDARD PATTERN AS I FLEW IT THAT DAY AND AS IS FLOWN BY OTHER PLTS AT B24. I TOLD HIM I HAD NOT SEEN THE CARDINAL WHERE IT WAS ANNOUNCED. I HAD 2 OTHER PEOPLE IN THE C170 TFC SPOTTING; AND THOUGHT THE CARDINAL HAD FLOWN AN EXTRAORDINARILY WIDE PATTERN. I EXPLAINED THAT THE CARDINAL'S ACTIONS AND RADIO WORK MISCOMMUNICATED ITS POS RELATIVE TO THE ARPT; LEADING ME TO SEARCH THE NORMAL DOWNWIND AREA. NOT SEEING TFC; I TURNED MY DOWNWIND AND FLEW THE PATTERN. I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE WAS A CLOSE ENCOUNTER WITH THE ACFT. GIVEN THE VISIBILITY AFFORDED BY THE C170; HAD THE CARDINAL HAD TO DIVE TO AVOID THE ACFT; I WOULD NO DOUBT HAVE SEEN IT. I DID NOT -- NOR DID MY PAX. I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE WAS A CLOSE ENCOUNTER OR NEAR MISS WITH THE CARDINAL. CONCLUSION: THERE MUST BE EVER-PRESENT VIGILANCE BY ALL PARTIES AT UNCTLED ARPTS. I WAS MISLED INTO SEARCHING THE NORMAL PATTERN AREA FOR ANNOUNCED TFC WHEN IT OBVIOUSLY WAS NOT THERE.

THIS WAS NOT IN EVIDENCE. THE POSSIBILITIES WERE AS I SEE IT: 1) A PIECE OF GUM OR CEMENT IN THE CARB TEMPORARILY STUCK IN THE JET. 2) I PULLED THE MIXTURE ACCIDENTALLY; AND THE EVIDENCE WAS MASKED BY NOT HAVING TIME TO EFFECT THE EFATO CHKS; AS I HAD TO DO THE CHKS FOR EFATO LNDG AND THE MIXTURE WAS PULLED IMMEDIATELY AS AN INADVERTENT START AND FIRE PRECAUTION. THIS CAUSE VERY UNLIKELY AS I WAS NOT AT CIRCUIT HT; AND EVEN AS A BE-KIND-TO-THE-ACFT ACTION IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO DO IT WITHOUT ASSOCIATING THE CUTOUT WITH THE THROTTLE ACTION; AND THOUGH I HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST TAUGHT TO DO THIS; I HAVE NOT DONE SO FOR MANY YRS. 3) IT WAS CARB ICE AND MY BEING USED TO A HVY 40 HP MOTOR GLIDER HAD MASKED THE PERFORMANCE DETERIORATION.

MY CESSNA TOOK OFF FROM DLL AT ABOUT XF30 ENRTE TO RYV. THE PRESENT WX CONDITION THEN WAS CLR SKIES AND 8-10 SM. PASSING MADISON; I BEGAN TO TRACK RYV USING THE ADF. I WAS STILL MAINTAINING ALT (2200 FT MSL) AND HDG. NOT LONG AFTER; WE PASSED OVER A LITTLE TOWN WHICH I COULD NOT IDENT ON THE MAP. I ALSO REALIZED THAT VISIBILITY WAS DIMINISHING BEFORE US. I THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE JUST CLOUDS; SO I DECIDED TO DSND TO 2000 FT MSL STILL TRACKING RYV ON THE ASDF. WE FLEW ABOUT 3 MINS PAST THE TOWN WE JUST SAW AND ALMOST SUDDENLY WE LOST ALL VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE GND. I SAID TO MY BROTHER THAT WE NEEDED TO GET OUT OF THIS SIT IMMEDIATELY; ASSURED HIM THAT EVERYTHING WAS FINE AND A 180 DEG TURN WOULD TAKE US BACK TO THE DIRECTION WE CAME FROM. AT THAT TIME IT SEEMED TO TAKE A WHILE BEFORE WE HAD SOME VISIBILITY BEFORE US; BUT WE COULD NOT FIND THE TOWN THAT WE HAD PAST OVER A FEW MINS AGO. I LOOKED OVER TO THE W HOPING TO SEE PERHAPS MADISON OR SOME OTHER TOWN BUT VISIBILITY WAS POOR. AT THIS POINT IN TIME; I DID NOT KNOW HOW FAR WE WERE AWAY FROM DLL OR RYV. I DECIDED TO CONTACT MADISON APCH FOR RADAR ASSISTANCE. SINCE RADAR SVCS WERE CLOSED IN MADISON; WE WERE ADVISED TO CONTACT ZAU WHICH RESPONDED TO OUR CALL IMMEDIATELY. I EXPLAINED TO ZAU THAT WE RAN INTO IFR CONDITIONS WHILE ENRTE VFR TO RYV. ZAU ASKED ME TO STATE MY INTENTION TO GO TO RYV. I TOLD HIM THAT WE WERE HEADED TOWARDS RYV FOR LNDG; AND WOULD APPRECIATE RADAR VECTORS TO THAT LOCATION. ZAU THEN INSTRUCTED ME TO SQUAWK IDENT. I WAS TOLD TO CLB TO 3000 FT MSL; AND GIVEN A HDG THAT WOULD TAKE ME TO RYV. SHORTLY AFTER; ZAU ADVISED ME TO ABANDON THE APCH TO RYV; STATING THAT THE CONDITIONS WERE IFR; AND THAT HE WOULD GIVE ME A NEW VECTOR TO DLL. ALL THIS TIME I WAS NOT ABLE TO SEE ANYTHING ON THE GND. AFTER ABOUT 10-15 MINS ON THE NEW COURSE AND ALT (4000 FT MSL); MY BODY BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THE PLANE WAS BANKED TO THE L AND ASCENDING. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE; I ASKED MY BROTHER IF HE TOO FELT THAT WE WERE TURNING; AND HE CONCURRED. I LOOKED OVER THE INSTS AND THE ALT INDICATOR WAS LEVEL; NOT CLBING NOR DSNDING; THE VSI WAS AT ZERO AND THE ALT INDICATOR WAS SHOWING 4000 FT MSL. EVERYTHING THE INSTS SHOWED ME WENT AGAINST WHAT OUR BODIES TOLD US. TO ASSURE MYSELF THAT I WAS TRACKING A STRAIGHT COURSE AND MAINTAINING ALT; I DECIDED TO CALL ZAU WHO SAID THAT I WAS DOING FINE AND FOR THE REST OF THE FLT I HAD TO JUST RELY ON THE INSTS. ABOUT 5 MINS PASSED. ZAU WAS ABLE TO CONTACT XYZ FLT WHICH WAS ENRTE TO DLL. A LITTLE LATER; ZAU COORDINATED WITH XYZ FLT WHO OFFERED TO ASSIST ME OUT OF THE IFR AREAS; TAKING ME TOWARDS DLL WHERE CONDITIONS WERE VFR. ZAU GAVE MED-FLT PERMISSION TO COMMUNICATE DIRECT WITH ME. ENRTE TO DLL; I REQUESTED XYZ FLT TO DIRECT ME TO PORTAGE INSTEAD; AS I WAS ALREADY LOW ON FUEL. XYZ FLT DSNDED ABOVE THE RWY AND WE DID A SAFE LNDG IN C47. UPON TOUCHDOWN; XYZ FLT RELAYED A MESSAGE FOR ZAU THAT WE WERE TO CALL HIM ASAP. AT THE FBO; I CALLED UP CTR WHO WANTED TO KNOW IF WE HAD A SAFE TOUCHDOWN. I APOLOGIZED TO HIM REGARDING THE INCIDENT AND ALSO THANKED HIM AND HIS STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK PUT INTO GETTING US OUT OF THE FOG AND DOWN SAFELY. I HAVE ASKED FOR THE NAMES OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO TALKED TO ME ON THE RADIO AND THE PLT OF XYZ FLT (UNKNOWN); THAT I MAY WRITE A PERSONAL NOTE OF 'THANKS' TO BOTH OF THEM FOR WHAT THEY HAD DONE FOR ME THAT NIGHT. IN RETROSPECT; I REALIZED THAT THE WX CAN CHANGE RAPIDLY OVER A FEW HRS. THE INCIDENT COULD BE AVOIDED IF I HAD GOTTEN A CURRENT WX RPT RATHER THAN RELY ON THE ONE THAT WAS TAKEN WHEN WE DEPARTED FROM C47 AT ABOUT XA00 HRS EVEN THOUGH THE WX THEN WAS EXCELLENT.

HE TOLD ME THAT I WOULD HAVE HEARD SOMETHING ON 124.1 AND THAT THERE WAS NO NEED TO CONTACT UNICOM SINCE THE TWR WAS OPERATING. I UNFOLDED MY CHART AND TOLD HIM THAT A CREASE HAD ERASED THE LAST DIGIT OF THE CTAF FREQ 124.1 AND THAT I DIALED IN 124.0. I CALLED TWR 10-15 MINS LATER TO ASK TO SPEAK WITH THE MGR. THE PERSON WITH WHOM I HAD ALREADY SPOKEN TOLD ME THAT HE WAS THE MGR. I ASKED HIM HIS NAME AND AGAIN OFFERED TO DRIVE TO AND SHOW HIM MY CHART WITH THE CREASE. HE DECLINED. I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE OUTCOME OF THE 'PLT RPT' FOR DEV AND I ASKED HIM WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO MY JOB AND LICENSE. HE TOLD ME 'I RPT; THEY INVESTIGATE.' CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: I TRUSTED REVIEWEE BECAUSE OF HIS CFI EXPERIENCE AND HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE AREA; TO PROCEED TOWARD XYZ ARPT. THE SKY WAS EMPTY; THE VISIBILITY WAS GREAT. THERE WAS NO CEILING. THESE FACTORS LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT SAFETY WAS NOT COMPROMISED. WE OPENED OUR EYES AND EARS AND SAW ONE PLANE DOING 1 TOUCH-AND-GO AT XYZ ARPT. WE HEARD THE AWOS AND HAD NO REASON TO THINK THAT OUR RADIOS WERE OTS. I DOUBLE- AND TRIPLECHKED MY READING OF THE CTAF FREQ; SEEING ONLY 124__ (BLANK). HOW IT WAS DISCOVERED: OVER THE PHONE WITH MGR OF XYZ TWR. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: I DIALED BOTH FREQS 124.0 CTAF AND 123.05 UNICOM SO THAT WE COULD XMIT ON AND MONITOR BOTH FREQS. IN ACCORD WITH MY CHIEF PLT; I WILL TAKE AN EXAMINATION ON REGS (FAR PARTS 61 AND 91). I WILL TAKE A CLASS WITH AN FSDO REPRESENTATIVE ON THAT SUBJECT MATTER.

WHEN WE TOOK OFF FROM RWY 25; WE WERE FACING A BRIGHT SUN; LOW ON THE HORIZON. JUDGEMENTS: POOR. DECISION: IMPAIRED BY PERCEPTIONS. FACTORS AFFECTING THE QUALITY OF HUMAN PERFORMANCE: NO EXPERIENCE OF THE AREA AND MISREADING OF THE FREQ ON THE MAP. ACTIONS OR INACTIONS: 1) ACTIONS: USE OF 2 FREQS AND SEE AND AVOID STRATEGY. 2) INACTIONS: NOT DIVERTING THE FLT TOWARD AN AIRSPACE I WAS MORE FAMILIAR WITH.

THE TANKS APPEARED TO BE FUEL IN NORMAN AND ABOUT 40% FULL IN SERMAN. IT WAS ALSO DARK; SO IT WAS HARD TO TELL.

(I ATTEMPTED AT THIS POINT TO CONTACT PROVIDENCE BECAUSE ON THE WAY INTO NORWOOD EARLIER THE BOSTON APCH CTLR HAD INSTRUCTED ME TO DO SO; AND SINCE I WAS HEADING IN THE DIRECTION OF PROVIDENCE'S SPACE; AND WAS; SO I THOUGHT; CLR OF BOSTON'S; I MADE NO ATTEMPT TO CONTACT BOSTON THIS TIME.) AFTER LNDG AT WINDHAM; I GOT A BETTER LOOK AT THE CHART AND REALIZED THAT WHERE I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN FLYING UNDER CLASS B AIRSPACE (FLOOR 4000 FT) (AS I WAS WHEN INBOUND TO NORWOOD EARLIER) I HAD ACTUALLY BEEN IN THE ADJOINING SECTION OF AIRSPACE (FLOOR 3000 FT); MEANING THAT FOR APPROX 3 MI I WAS VIOLATING THE BOSTON CLASS B AIRSPACE. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS AND HUMAN PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS: 1) AS I LEARNED ON MY PREVIOUS TRIP TO NORWOOD; ALTHOUGH IT IS UNDER THE BOSTON B AIRSPACE; ONE MAY DEPART IT WITHOUT A CLRNC FROM CLRNC DELIVERY -- JUST CONTACT BOSTON APCH WHEN AIRBORNE. ON MY PREVIOUS TRIP I WAS DIRECTED TO DO THIS; FAILED TO GET ACKNOWLEDGED BY BOSTON APCH; AND CONTINUED ON MY WAY WELL BELOW THE AIRSPACE; WITHOUT FLT FOLLOWING.

PERHAPS I FAILED TO STATE MY INTENTION TO CLB TO 4500 FT WHEN MAKING MY REQUEST TO DEPART FROM NORWOOD. THE CTLR; WHO WAS QUITE HELPFUL; WOULD PROBABLY HAVE WARNED ME OF THE ERROR I WAS ABOUT TO MAKE IF I HAD STATED MY INTENTIONS MORE CLRLY AND COMMUNICATED MORE. UNLIKE THE BOSTON APCH CTLR HE WAS NOT TOO BUSY; AND I FAILED TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF HIS HELP. 2) WHEN INBOUND I HAD TRAVERSED UNDER THE CLASS B SPACE FLOOR 4000 FT. BY DEP TIME; THE RWY IN USE HAD CHANGED; WHICH PUT ME FURTHER; TO THE S RATHER THAN FLYING THE REVERSE OF MY INBOUND COURSE AS I INTENDED. I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT OBSERVING THE NOISE ABATEMENT COURSE FOR RWY 17; AND FAILED TO OBSERVE THE OTHER MODIFICATION I WOULD HAVE TO MAKE TO MY FLT PLAN; A LOWER FLOOR TO THE AIRSPACE. I SHOULD HAVE CHKED THE CHART UPON RECEIVING THE NEW RWY ASSIGNMENT INSTEAD OF ASSUMING I WOULD MERELY REVERSE MY INBOUND COURSE AND FLY THE VOR. I ALLOWED MYSELF TO GIVE IN TO 'HURRY.'

DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME WAS A LINE OF MOUNTAINS WITH THE LOWEST BEING 5700 FT. I BECAME PREOCCUPIED BY VERIFYING THAT I WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT CLRNC OF THE TERRAIN; AND I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT I HAD CLBED THROUGH 4000 FT TO 4100 FT. AS SOON AS I REALIZED MY MISTAKE; I BEGAN A DSCNT BACK TO 4000 FT. MOMENTS LATER; ATC CLRED ME FOR 6500 FT; AND I BEGAN A CLB. ABOUT 5 SECONDS LATER; ATC CANCELED THE ALT CLRNC AND INSTRUCTED ME TO MAINTAIN 4000 FT; WHICH I PROCEEDED TO DO. 10 SECONDS LATER; THE CTLR ASKED ME WHETHER I HAD CLBED ABOVE 4000 FT; AND I REPLIED THAT I HAD CLBED TO 4100 FT (THE LAST ALT THAT I RECALLED BEING AT). THE CTLR THEN INFORMED ME THAT TFC WAS EITHER XING OVERHEAD OR NEARBY AT 4500 FT (I'M NOT SURE WHICH). I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER A LOSS OF SEPARATION OCCURRED HERE; AND IF SO; DID IT OCCUR BEFORE OR AFTER THE CTLR CLRED ME TO 6500 FT? THERE ARE SEVERAL CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THIS INCIDENT. THE MAIN FACTOR INVOLVES LACK OF PLANNING WITH REGARD TO AN UNFAMILIAR CLRNC GIVEN BY CLRNC DELIVERY. FOR THIS TRIP; I HAD ORIGINALLY PLANNED TO DEPART N RWY 19; BUT DUE TO WINDS THAT DAY; THE RWYS WERE REVERSED; AND I FOUND MYSELF CLBING OUT ON A WESTERLY HDG INSTEAD OF A SOUTHERLY ONE. I SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERED THIS AFTER CLRNC DELIVERY ISSUED MY DEP CLRNC; AND SHOULD HAVE CONSULTED MY CHARTS WITH REGARD TO THE TERRAIN AROUND THE DEP RTE. I DID NOT SEE THE LINE OF MOUNTAINS THAT DISTR ME UNTIL I WAS AIRBORNE; SO I BECAME PREOCCUPIED WITH MY CHARTS. BECAUSE OF THIS; I OVERSHOT MY CLRED ALT. THE SECOND FACTOR INVOLVES ASSUMPTIONS THAT I MADE ABOUT MY RTE OF FLT. ON DEP; I HAD EXPECTED TO CLB VIA A SBOUND COURSE (FROM PLT GUIDE) AND PROCEEDED BY PILOTAGE BY FOLLOWING I-15 S TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WHAT THE CTLR WAS DOING WAS VECTORING ME TO V-394. THIS WOULD HAVE EVENTUALLY BROUGHT ME BACK TO MY INTENDED COURSE; BUT THE INITIAL SEGMENT HAD ME XING HIGH TERRAIN THAT I WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE AVOIDED. INITIALLY; I WAS NOT AWARE OF THIS; AND I SHOULD HAVE ASKED THE CTLR ABOUT HIS INTENTIONS AND ADVISED HIM OF MY INTENDED RTE OF FLT. SO IN ADDITION TO BEING DISTR BY TERRAIN AVOIDANCE; I WAS DISTR FROM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE ATC WAS VECTORING ME TO; SO I WASN'T MINDING MY ALT. FROM NOW ON; I WILL CONSULT MY CHARTS BEFORE DEP IF I AM GIVEN AN UNFAMILIAR OR UNPLANNED CLRNC RTE. I WILL ALSO BE MORE PRO-ACTIVE IN ASKING ATC ABOUT THEIR INTENTIONS IF I AM BEING VECTORED IN AN UNEXPECTED DIRECTION. THESE STEPS WOULD HAVE AVOIDED ANY DISTRS IN BUSY AIRSPACE.",,,,"ALT AND NAV PROB IN LAS CLASS B AIRSPACE COUPLED WITH A TFC CONFLICT.",

WHEN I PARKED THE PLANE I LISTENED TO THE ATIS AND FOUND THAT RWY 26R WAS CLOSED FOR LNDGS. THE MAIN CAUSE OF THIS EVENT IS I DID NOT HAVE THE CORRECT ATIS. THE ATIS WAS JUST UPDATED DURING MY CALL. THE CTLR DID NOT MENTION THE NEW ATIS. ALSO A FACTOR IN THIS WAS A TRAINING FLT WITH A DIFFICULT STUDENT. I WAS OVERLOADED WITH TEACHING THE STUDENT. ALSO ANOTHER FACTOR WAS THE CTLR WAS OVERLOADED AT THE TIME. THE CTLR WAS PREPARING FOR A FLY-BY OVER A DRAG RACE NEAR THE APCH END OF RWYS 26R AND 26L. THERE WAS ALSO BANNER TOWING OVER THE EVENT.

THE PLT THEN TOOK OFF USING THE COUNTY ROAD WITH NO EVENTS; AND FLEW FOR APPROX 30 MORE MINS; WHICH CONCLUDED THE DAY'S FLYING. AFTER GOING OVER THE EVENTS OF THE DAY THE PLT CAME TO ANOTHER CONCLUSION AS TO THE CAUSE OF THE ENG STOPPAGE. WIND CONDITION FOR THE DAY AND THE COURSE THAT WAS USED CAUSED THE ACFT TO BE FLOWN IN A SLIGHT R WING DOWN ATTITUDE MOST OF THAT AFTERNOON; AND THAT WAS THE ATTITUDE IT WAS IN WHEN THE STOPPAGE OCCURRED.

AS I TAXIED ONTO THE RWY; I STATED ON THE RADIO I WAS ROLLING ON RWY 5 (NOTE WRONG RWY NUMBER). AS I WAS ABOUT TO ROTATE; I SPOTTED THE ROBINSON R22 ON SHORT FINAL TO RWY 5. NO CALLS ON THE UNICOM HAD BEEN MADE FROM THE R22. FROM MY POS THE HELI APPEARED TO BE OFFSET TO THE R SIDE OF THE RWY. IT IS NORMAL FOR THE TRAINING HELIS TO MAKE AN APCH AND LAND IN THE GRASS ALONG THE SIDE OF THE RWY. THIS IS WHAT I THOUGHT THEY WERE DOING. SINCE I WAS ALREADY AIRBORNE; I STARTED A L TURN TO MANEUVER AWAY FROM THE HELI AS I GAINED ALT. THE R22 DID NOT LAND; BUT INSTEAD CONTINUED WITH A LOW APCH DOWN THE CTRLINE OF RWY 5. THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME ANY RADIO CALL WAS MADE (OTHER THAN MINE); WAS WHEN SOMEONE AT THE FBO CALLED TO THE HELI ON UNICOM INFORMING HIM OF ME USING THE OPPOSITE RWY. THE HELI PLT WAS LISTENING AND STATED HE HAD US IN SIGHT; BUT HEARD ME SAY I WAS DEPARTING RWY 5. I ACKNOWLEDGED ON THE UNICOM FREQ I DID INADVERTENTLY SAY RWY 5 AND APOLOGIZED. AT NO TIME WERE OUR 2 ACFT LESS THAN 400 FT APART. I ADMIT MY MIND WAS ON GETTING THE ACFT BACK TO GMU BEFORE IT OVERHEATED AGAIN. BUT UP UNTIL MY 'DEP CALL;' I HAD STATED SEVERAL TIMES I WOULD BE USING RWY 23.

ON JUL/MON/01 AT XA30; I HAD ONE OF MY STUDENT PLTS (A FOREIGN STUDENT FROM INDIA) MAKE A SOLO FLT FOR THE SECOND TIME IN THE PATTERN AND PERFORM TOUCH-AND-GOES AT THE ARPT. DURING THE TOUCH-AND-GOES MY STUDENT WAS TOLD BY THE CTL TWR THAT HE NEEDED TO EXTEND HIS DOWNWIND LEG TO ALLOW ROOM FOR A KING AIR THAT WAS MAKING AN APCH TO LAND AT THE ARPT. AFTER MY STUDENT RECEIVED THE INFO FROM THE TWR HE LOOKED FOR THE TFC AND DID NOT SEE THE KING AIR. BEING NERVOUS FROM HIS SECOND SOLO FLT AND FEARING THAT IF HE CONTINUED EXTENDING HIS DOWNWIND LEG HE WOULD LOSE SIGHT OF THE ARPT; HE TURNED BASE AND PERFORMED A TOUCH-AND-GO IN FRONT OF THE KING AIR. TO MY KNOWLEDGE THE KING AIR WAS ABLE TO MAKE A NORMAL APCH WITH NO CONFLICT OCCURRING AS A RESULT OF THE STUDENT'S DECISION TO TURN BASE AND MAKE A TOUCH-AND-GO. THE TWR MADE A RADIO CALL TO THE STUDENT AND REQUESTED AN EXPLANATION OF WHY HE DID NOT EXTEND DOWNWIND. THE STUDENT INFORMED THE TWR THAT HE WAS A STUDENT PLT ON HIS SECOND SOLO. THE TWR THEN MADE A PHONE CALL TO ZZZ FBO WHERE I WAS SUPERVISING MY STUDENT'S SOLO AND LET ME KNOW OF THE SIT THAT HAD OCCURRED. I THEN APOLOGIZED TO THE TWR AND INFORMED HIM THAT HE WAS A STUDENT PLT AND I REQUESTED THAT THE TWR TELL MY STUDENT TO LAND. THE TWR THEN MADE A RADIO CALL TO MY STUDENT AND SAID THAT HE WAS 'CLRED TO LAND.' MY STUDENT; NOT REALIZING WHAT WAS GOING ON; DID A TOUCH-AND-GO. HE THOUGHT THAT IF THE TWR WANTED HIM TO STOP HE WOULD HAVE SAID 'CLRED TO LAND; MAKE IT A FULL STOP.' WELL; AFTER HE DID THAT TOUCH-AND-GO THE TWR CALLED ME FOR THE SECOND TIME AND SAID THAT HE WAS WRITING ME A CITATION AND TO EXPECT A VISIT FROM THE FSDO. IN MY PERSONAL OPINION; I BELIEVE THAT THE TWR OVERREACTED TO THE SIT. THE TFC AT THE ARPT THAT MORNING WAS SLOW; AND MY STUDENT WAS NEW -- ONLY BEEN FLYING FOR MAYBE 3 WKS. ZZZ FBO IS A FLT SCHOOL THAT HAS BEEN GROWING VERY RAPIDLY AND IS GOING TO GROW 9 TIMES LARGER WITHIN THE NEXT 4 OR 5 MONTHS. THIS GROWTH HAS CAUSED AN INCREASED HEADACHE AND A DECREASE IN TOLERANCE BY THE ZZZ ATC TOWARD THE FLT SCHOOL STUDENTS. I BELIEVE THAT THIS OCCURRENCE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN TREATED SO STRICTLY AND FORCEFULLY HAD IT BEEN A PLANE NOT BELONGING TO ZZZ FBO. I KNOW FOR A FACT THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE WAY THE ATC AT ZZZ HAS BEEN HANDLING AIR TFC. IN CONCLUSION; I CANNOT THINK OF ANYTHING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE TO PREVENT THIS SIT FROM OCCURRING OTHER THAN A CTLR THAT WAS MORE UNDERSTANDING OF A STUDENT PLT'S INEXPERIENCE.",,,,"FOREIGN STUDENT ON SECOND SOLO FLT DID NOT ADHERE TO ATCT LCL CTLR INSTRUCTIONS AT ZZZ; US.",

I WAS NOT ABLE TO CATCH THE NIGHTLY NEWS LIKE THE REST OF AMERICA THAT LEARNED YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO FLY WITHIN 10 NM OF ANY FACILITY. I DID NOT EVEN KNOW THERE WAS A POWER PLANT IN THE STATE. ON THE VFR TERMINAL AREA CHART; THE FACILITY IS ONLY MARKED BY THE 1000 FT AGL AND BELOW OBSTRUCTION SYMBOL WITH SMALL NON CAPITALIZED LETTERS SAYING PLANT. I DID NOT KNOW THIS SYMBOL WAS A PWR PLANT. I ARRIVED AT THE ARPT AT XA00 ON THE MORNING OF 10/WED/01. MY STUDENT AND I DID OUR STANDARD EVALUATION OF THE CURRENT WX AND NOTAMS ON OUR RECENTLY PURCHASED DTN WHICH GIVES US WX AND NOTAMS VIA SATELLITE. THIS SYSTEM IS NOT AN FAA SYSTEM LIKE YOUR STANDARD DUATS; THEREFORE I SHOULD HAVE CHECKED WITH A WX BRIEFER. ENCLOSED IS THE PRINTOUT OF NOTAMS THAT WERE AVAILABLE TO ME ON THIS DTN SYSTEM. YOU WILL SEE THAT THERE IS NO MENTION OF THE SITES IN THIS STATE. MY STUDENT AND I DEPARTED THE ARPT ON A LOCAL FLT AT XA30. WE THEN FLEW DIRECT TO ZZZ. WE DID ONE TOUCH AND GO AND NOTED THE FACT THAT HERE WAS A DECENT SURFACE WIND FOR PRACTICING GND REFERENCE MANEUVERS. MY STUDENT REQUESTED AT THAT TIME TO DO SOME GND REFERENCE MANEUVERS. I THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO PRACTICE THESE MANEUVERS WITH ANY KIND OF WIND UNTIL THIS POINT. SO WE VENTURED OFF TO A LOCAL PRACTICE AREA LOCATED OUT ON THE RADIAL OF THE VOR AND 2 STATUTE MI S OF YYY. WE WERE AT 500 FT AGL WHEN WE WERE INTERCEPTED BY TWO F16 FALCONS. I IMMEDIATELY SWITCHED THE ONE RADIO THAT WE HAD TO 121.5. MY FIRST CALL WAS 'F16 8 MILES SE OF ZZZ THIS IS CESSNA ON 121.5.' FSS RADIO IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED WITH 'CESSNA THIS IS FSS RADIO IF YOU ARE 8 SE OF ZZZ YOU ARE IN A NO FLY ZONE.' I RESPONDED WITH 'FSS RADIO THIS IS CESSNA WE WILL HEAD DIRECTLY N.' FSS RADIO CAME BACK WITH 'THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA.' I LATER CAME BACK WITH FSS ON 121.5 BECAUSE THE F16S WERE DOING REPEATED PASSES AND TOLD THEM. WE WERE HEADING DIRECT FOR XXX AND AT THIS POINT FSS RADIO RELAYED THAT INFO TO THE PROPER AGENCIES AND TOLD US TO SWITCH TO FREQ AND STAY WITH THEM TO XXX. WE LATER GOT A FREQ CHANGE FOR CTAF AND LANDED. MY FIRST ACTION AFTER BEING INTERCEPTED WAS THE ROCKING OF THE WINGS AND TRYING TO FOLLOW THE INTERCEPTOR TO THE DESIRED HEADING PER PAGE 5-6-4 OF THE AERONAUTICAL INFO MANUAL AFTER WATCHING THE F16 PERFORM CLIMBING TURN TO 18000 FT. I DECIDED TO HEAD N AWAY FROM THE BRAVO AIRSPACE. IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT I WAS ABLE RAISE FSS RADIO ON 121.5. I FEEL THIS SIT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF ALL ARPT MANAGERS WERE REQUIRED TO POST THIS INFO ON TFR'S AND OTHER AIRSPACE CLOSURES OF THIS MAGNITUDE AT ACCESS POINTS TO THE RAMP. I FEEL THE STANDARDIZATION OF ALL COMPUTER BASED WX BRIEFING SYSTEMS FOUND IN FLT PLANNING ROOMS AT MOST FBO SHOULD BE CERTIFIED BY THE FAA TO GIVE OUT THE CORRECT INFO. I FEEL THAT ALL SITES SHOULD BE CLEARLY MARKED AND SHOWN AS NATIONAL SECURITY AREAS. I WILL ALWAYS GET THE CURRENT NOTAMS STRAIGHT FROM THE WEATHER BRIEFER FROM THIS DAY ON.

SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE MY FLT I HAD CREATED A FLT PLAN INCLUDING CHKPOINTS; ETA; AND DISTANCES AND REVIEWED IT WITH MY INSTRUCTOR. THE MORNING BEFORE THE FLT I CALLED FOR A PREFLT BRIEFING AND REVIEWED MY PLAN WITH AN INSTRUCTOR AT THE ARPT BEFORE MY FLT. I WAS TOLD THERE WERE NO NOTAMS ENRTE AND THAT THE WEATHER WAS FINE. FOR THE LAST 30 MILES OF THE FLT I WAS MOSTLY FLYING OVER NON-DESCRIPT FARMLAND AND THERE WERE VERY FEW VISUAL CHKPOINTS. ONE OF MY CHKPOINTS WAS CROSSING THE 47 DEG LINE OF THE PATUXENT RIVER VOR. AS I NEARED THE CHKPOINT I COULD NOT RAISE THE MORSE CODE FOR THE PATUXENT RIVER VOR SO I CONSULTED MY CHART AND FOUND THAT I WAS STILL ON COURSE; BUT I NO LONGER HAD GOOD TIME ESTIMATES FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FLT. MY NEXT CHKPOINT WAS TO FLY OVER THE CTR OF THREE TOWNS. WHEN I REACHED WHAT I THOUGH WAS THE CHKPOINT I APPEARED TO BE OVER THE SOUTHERNMOST OF THE TOWNS INSTEAD OF THE CENTRAL ONE.

I DECIDED THAT FURTHER CIRCLING WOULD GIVE ME NO NEW INFO AND THAT THE BEST MOVE WOULD BE TO LAND. I LANDED AND BEGAN TAXIING OF THE RWY.

HE CONTINUED; 'YOU SHOULD NOT BE FLYING A THING.' I SINCERELY APOLOGIZED TO HIM; ALTHOUGH I WAS NOT SURE IF I HAD MADE A MISTAKE. I THOUGHT AT LEAST THAT WAS THE POLITE WAY TO SAY TO THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THE AVIATION SAFETY. HE SAID THAT I CHANGED FROM THE ONT TWR FREQ WITHOUT HIS APPROVAL. THAT IS WHY HE COULD NOT GIVE MY HDG. HE DID NOT SPECIFY WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED AFTER I CHANGED MY RADIO FREQ. ALTHOUGH I WAS TELLING HIM THAT I WAS POSITIVE THAT I WAS INSTRUCTED TO CHANGE THE RADIO FREQ TO SOCAL APCH BY ONT TWR; HE DENIED THIS AND SUDDENLY HUNG UP AFTER HIS SAYING 'TALK TO YOU SOON!' IT WAS APPARENTLY IMPLYING THAT HE WAS GOING TO TRY TO TAKE AN ACTION AGAINST ME FOR CERTIFICATE ACTIONS FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE FARS. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY WITH GOOD VISIBILITY OF MORE THAN 10 MI. I TOOK OFF FROM EL MONTE ABOUT XA45 ON JAN/SUN/02 ONT ARPT. IT WAS AN UNEVENTFUL FLT AND I LANDED RWY 26L. I TOOK A BREAK FOR ABOUT 20 MINS AND WENT BACK ON BOARD TO MY C152 (RENTAL). BEFORE I STARTED THE ENG; I TALKED TO ONT DEP CTL (APPROX XB20). HE GAVE ME SQUAWKING NUMBER XXXX AND SUGGESTED 'R DEP' AND INSTRUCTED ME TO FLY BELOW 2500 FT. ONT ARPT HAS 2 RWYS (RWY 26L AND RWY 27R). THEN I STARTED THE ENG AND CHANGED MY RADIO FREQ TO ONT GND. THIS TIME I WAS INSTRUCTED TO TAXI TO RWY 26L. I THOUGHT THAT I WAS STILL GOING TO TAKE OFF FROM RWY 26R; BUT TAXI TO RWY 26L AND WAIT BEFORE XING THE RWY 26L. BEFORE THE HOLD SHORT LINE AT RWY 26L; I CHANGED MY RADIO FREQ TO ONT TWR. I SAW A BIG B737 WAS ARRIVING TO RWY 26R. THE TWR GAVE ME CLRNC FOR TAKING OFF FROM RWY 26L. I DID NOT GET A SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION EITHER TO MAKE A R TURN AFTER TKOF NOR STRAIGHT OUT DEP. AS I DID TAKE OFF FROM ONT ARPT TO EL MONTE ARPT BEFORE; I TOOK OFF ON COURSE WITH HDG OF 026 DEGS. AFTER ABOUT 5 MINS; I RECEIVED AN INSTRUCTION FROM ONT TWR TO CHANGE MY FREQ TO SOCAL APCH. I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS ABOUT THE RIGHT TIME FOR ME TO HEAR ONT TWR'S INSTRUCTION TO CHANGE MY FREQ; SINCE I WAS ALREADY OR ALMOST OUT OF THE CLASS C AIRSPACE SURROUNDING ONT ARPT. MY ALT WAS ABOUT 2000 FT. SINCE I COULD NOT REPEAT THE EXACT FREQ; I REPLIED TO THEM SAYING 'N-NUMBER; FREQ CHANGE;' AND I CHKED THE CHART TO DOUBLECHK THE FREQ OF SOCAL APCH. THE FREQ WAS BUSY AND I COULD NOT START TALKING TO THEM RIGHT AWAY. THE CLASS D AIRSPACE OF THE BRACKETT FIELD WAS GETTING CLOSE. I DECIDED TO TALK TO BRACKETT FIELD TWR TO REQUEST THE APPROVAL OF TRANSITION THROUGH CLASS D AIRSPACE AT 1900 FT. THE BRACKETT TWR APPROVED MY TRANSITION AND INSTRUCTED ME TO SQUAWK 1200. I THINK I WAS ABOUT 3 MI SE OF THE ARPT. I FLEW BACK TO EL MONTE ARPT AND TALKED TO GND CTL WHO ASKED ME WHETHER I WAS WITH AN INSTRUCTOR AND INSTRUCTED ME TO CALL ONT TWR. I AM PRETTY SURE; ALTHOUGH I CANNOT BE 100%; THAT I WAS INSTRUCTED TO CHANGE FREQ FROM ONT TWR TO SOCAL APCH BY THE TWR. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PROVE WITHOUT AN AUDIO TAPE. THE ONT TWR SUPVR DID NOT SPECIFY WHAT THE CONSEQUENCE WAS OF MY LEAVING FREQ OF ONT TWR. I MIGHT HAVE TAKEN A COURSE; WHICH WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE COURSE HE WAS THINKING ABOUT.

I CLBED TO 5500 FT OUT OF IZA AND CONTACTED SANTA BARBARA APCH FOR FLT FOLLOWING TO TOA. AFTER PASSING THE VENTURA VOR I SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE A BLANKET OF CLOUDS OVER THE S BAY. I STATED THIS TO MUGU APCH WHO GOT BACK TO ME WITH INFO FROM TOA WHICH WAS 20 NM VISIBILITY; BROKEN AT 2500 FT; ETC. I PROCEEDED AND WAS CLRED FOR THE SHORELINE RTE WITH SOCAL AT 5500 FT. I STATED TO THEM THAT I DIDN'T HAVE THE SHORELINE IN SIGHT AND THEY GAVE ME VECTORS WHICH GOT ME OVER TORRANCE. OVER TORRANCE THEY ASKED ME TO START A DSCNT WHICH I DECLINED BECAUSE THERE WERE NO BREAKS IN THE CLOUD LAYER WHICH SEEMED TO BE AT ABOUT 5000 FT. TOA WAS CLAIMING THEY HAD CLR SKIES TO THE S; THEY COULD SEE THE OCEAN. SOCAL VECTORED ME AROUND WHILE I LOOKED FOR AN OPENING. I WAS STARTING TO GET LOW ON FUEL AND THERE WERE NO OPENINGS IN THE CLOUDS. THERE WAS A FULL MOON AND I COULD SEE A BLANKET FOR AS FAR AS MY EYES COULD SEE. I TOLD SOCAL THIS AND THAT I WAS PREPARED TO GO THROUGH THE CLOUDS TO GET DOWN BECAUSE THAT LOOKED LIKE MY ONLY POSSIBILITY. THEY GAVE ME A VECTOR AND I STARTED A DSCNT DOWN THROUGH THE CLOUDS. I BROKE OUT OF THE CLOUDS AT ABOUT 4000 FT OVER SAN PEDRO HARBOR. AT THIS POINT I COULD SEE TOA CLRLY AND WAS ABLE TO COME IN AND LAND SAFELY. TOA WAS CORRECT WHEN THEY SAID THEY COULD SEE OUT TO THE OCEAN; BUT THEY HAD NO IDEA THERE WAS A CEILING AT 4000 FT FROM THE MARINE LAYER THAT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE THERE UNTIL XG00. I BELIEVE THE PROB WAS WITH THE WX FORECASTING. IT DIDN'T REALLY SEEM LIKE ANYBODY KNEW THE MARINE LAYER WAS THERE EXCEPT FOR ME SINCE I WAS RIGHT ABOVE IT. I'M NOT INST RATED BUT HAVE FLOWN IN THE CLOUDS WITH INSTRUCTORS BEFORE AND HAVE LOGGED QUITE A BIT OF HOOD TIME AND MADE A FEW PRACTICE APCHS IN PREPARATION FOR AN INST RATING. THIS HELPED ME GET DOWN THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND MAKE A SAFE LNDG; BUT NONETHELESS I ONLY HOLD A PVT PLT CERTIFICATE AND THE WX BRIEFING I RECEIVED PUT ME INTO A DANGEROUS SIT. UPON LNDG I TALKED TO SOME OTHER PLTS WHO HAD GONE UP BUT CAME RIGHT BACK DOWN BECAUSE OF THE WX AND THEY WERE UNDER THE SAME IMPRESSION I WAS; 20 NM VISIBILITY; BROKEN CLOUDS; ETC; THE CONDITIONS THAT WERE BEING RPTED TO THEM FROM FSS AND LCL ATIS RECORDINGS.",,,,"A C152 PLT FOUND HIMSELF IMC IN VFR.",

I FIRST LOOKED UP THE WX ON WEB SITE. IT CALLED FOR VFR AND I ALSO WATCHED THE WX CHANNEL. NO SIGNIFICANT WX. AT ABOUT XA18; 1 HR LATER; I CALLED FSS AND THE WX BRIEFER TOLD ME THAT THE WX WAS VFR. HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT FOR THE RTE OF FLT I WAS TAKING THAT BTWN 5000-6000 FT I WOULD PICK UP A TAILWIND OF ABOUT 10 KTS. I TOOK OFF FROM THE ARPT (F45) 1 HR LATER AND STARTED THE CLB UP TO 6500 FT TOWARDS TAMPA. AT 6500 FT THE SKY WAS CLR; NO CLOUDS; UNTIL I CROSSED OVER LAKE OKEECHOBEE WEST; CLOSE TO LAKE CHANCE ARPT. I THEN STARTED MY TURN TO THE NW AND NOTICED CLOUDS TO THE S STILL CLR TO THE N. AT THIS TIME I STARTED TO PREPARE FOR MY ARR INTO TPA ARPT GOING OVER THE CHARTS; MY FIRST TRIP INTO CLASS B AIRSPACE. I WAS MAKING MY SCANS TO THE SIDE AND FRONT OF THE PLACE. AFTER 10 MINS; I LOOKED DOWN AND THERE WAS A SOLID BLANKET OF CLOUDS EXCEPT FOR A 2+ MI OPENING AT ABOUT 4000 FT. I THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD BE THE ONLY OPENING TO GET DOWN SO I STARTED THE DSCNT DOWN. BEFORE I COULD GET THROUGH THE CLOUDS; WX FACTORS SEALED THE OPENING. I THEN STARTED THE CLB UP AT THE MAX RATE OF CLB BUT THE CLOUDS COVERED ME AT THIS POINT. I SQUAWKED 7700; 7600 AND CALLED FSS 122.00 AND DECLARED AN EMER; BUT MY RADIO WAS NOT WORKING CORRECTLY. THERE WAS A LOT OF STATIC. I COULD MAKE OUT SOME OF THE XMISSION IN CALLING ZMA; BUT EVERY CHANNEL I TRIED I COULD NOT GET THROUGH. I HAVE HAD ABOUT 10 HRS OF INST TRAINING AND HAVE GONE TO THE DISTRICT TRAINING CLASSES. SO I KEPT THE WINGS LEVEL AND SLOWED MY SPD TO ABOUT 65 KTS. I KEPT PRESSING THE IDENT ON THE XPONDER WITH 7600 IN IT SO ZMA COULD KEEP ANY PLANES AWAY FROM MY PLANE. AT THIS POINT; I HAD TO GET DOWN WITH NO HELP. I WAS AT ABOUT 5500 FT AND DECIDED TO DSND 500 FT AT A TIME AND WATCH MY INSTS CAREFULLY. AT ABOUT 3500+ FT I BROKE THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND THEN SQUAWKED 1200 AND TRIED TO CONTACT FSS; BUT NO ANSWER. I THEN TRIED TO CONTACT TPA APCH BUT NO ANSWER TO LET THEM KNOW I WAS ALRIGHT. I WAS ABOUT 35 MI OUT AND I CONTACTED TPA APCH. THE CTLR THERE TOLD ME THAT IF I LANDED IN HIS AIRSPACE THAT I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO LEAVE UNTIL THE RADIO WAS FIXED. THE FSS MAN ALSO TOLD ME THAT IN THE AREA OF WEST OKEECHOBEE THERE ARE NO WX RPTING STATIONS. SO THERE IS NO REAL WAY TO TRACK THE WX. THE CORRECTIVE ACTION WOULD BE TO PUT A RPTING STATION AT OR AROUND LABELLE OR ARCADIA AREA.

THE COMMERCIAL AIRLINERS TAKE OFF TO THE N BECAUSE THAT IS THE DIRECTION THEY ARE HEADING.

THE CTLR HAVING A BAD DAY WAS THE MAIN CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT. WHY SHE WAS WORKING; I DO NOT KNOW! CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WERE A HIGH NUMBER OF ACFT IN THE PATTERNS AT RVS; AND AN OVCST THAT MADE IT HARD FOR US TO SEE THE CESSNA ACFT ABOVE US; WHILE WE WERE CLBING TO PATTERN ALT. MORE SPACING AND BETTER TFC ALERTS; AND A LIMIT TO ACFT OPS AT RVS WOULD HELP PREVENT THESE INCIDENTS; BUT WOULD IMPACT EFFICIENCY AT RVS.

I WAS FLYING FROM THE R SEAT IN THIS CASE. PRIOR TO TKOF; THE ASOS INDICATED THE WIND WAS 7 KTS AND 10 DEGS L OF RWY CTRLINE. THE WINDSOCK AGREED WITH THIS DIRECTION BUT I ESTIMATED THE SPD MORE LIKE 10-12 KTS. I DID NOT LEAVE THE PATTERN AND THE FOLLOWING INCIDENT OCCURRED ON THE FIRST LNDG. I HAD PLANNED TO DO A PRACTICE SHORT FIELD LNDG BUT ON FINAL HAD SOME DIFFICULTY STABILIZING THE GS; APPARENTLY DUE TO WIND GUSTS EVEN THOUGH NO GUST FACTOR WAS INDICATED ON THE ASOS. SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT PWR CHANGES WERE REQUIRED ON FINAL. FOR THIS REASON; I WAS ATTEMPTING TO MAINTAIN 60 KIAS RATHER THAN THE NORMAL SHORT FIELD APCH SPD OF 55 KIAS FOR THIS ACFT. ON SHORT FINAL AT ABOUT 100 FT AGL; I EVIDENTLY ENCOUNTERED SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT WINDSHEAR BUT PERHAPS DIDN'T FULLY APPRECIATE WHAT HAD HAPPENED. AIRSPD INCREASED BY AT LEAST 10 KTS AND THE DSCNT RATE WENT NEAR ZERO. I CUT PWR TO CTL THE DSCNT RATE AND PROBABLY INSTINCTIVELY RAISED THE NOSE A BIT TO CTL THE AIRSPD. JUST ABOUT THE TIME I GOT THESE CORRECTIONS IN PLACE; I EVIDENTLY HIT THE OPPOSITE WINDSHEAR AS THE AIRPLANE SUDDENLY STARTED DSNDING VERY RAPIDLY. I WENT TO FULL PWR BUT KEPT THE NOSE DOWN A BIT TO AVOID A STALL. UNFORTUNATELY; I COULD NOT ARREST THE DSCNT AND EITHER RAN OUT OF ALT OR HAD INSUFFICIENT AIRSPD TO PULL THE NOSE UP AND FLARE. THE NOSEWHEEL CONTACTED THE GND FIRST AND HARD AND COLLAPSED WHICH ALSO RESULTED IN THE PROP STRIKING THE GND WITH FULL PWR. FLYING FROM THE R SEAT MAY HAVE BEEN A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR.

PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT; LGB TWR HAD ISSUED A FREQ CHANGE. HOWEVER; BECAUSE WE WERE STILL WITHIN LGB DELTA AIRSPACE; I REMAINED ON TWR FREQ. WE WERE APPROX 1900-2200 FT IN ALT WHEN ALL THIS OCCURRED. I THEN CALLED THE TWR AND ASKED WHAT RWY THE BONANZA HAD DEPARTED; AS THIS ACFT WAS WITHIN LGB DELTA AIRSPACE TOO. ALT FIRST THE CTLR SAID IT HAD DEPARTED RWY 25R; AND THEN HE SAID THAT WASN'T TRUE; THE CTLR FOR THAT RWY HAD DEPARTED A CESSNA 172 SBOUND ALONG THE RIVER. I SAID I WONDERED; BECAUSE 'YOU GUYS ARE PRETTY GOOD AT LETTING THOSE ACFT KNOW WE WERE IN FRONT OF THEM.' I DID RELATE SEVERAL TIMES THAT OUR ENCOUNTER WAS A CLOSE ONE. THEY SAID THEY HAD NOT BEEN IN CONTACT WITH ANY BONANZA AT THAT TIME. THE CTLR DID INFORM ME THERE WERE NUMEROUS TARGETS IN THE VICINITY S OF OUR POS AT THAT TIME. THE WHOLE ENCOUNTER SEEMED TO BE ONE OF THE TYPICAL HIGH WING; LOW WING TYPE. AM NOT CERTAIN THAT THE BONANZA PLT SAW US; AND THIS PLT DEFINITELY AVOIDED CONTACTING LGB TWR FOR TRANSITION; DUE TO HIS POS AND ALT. WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHERE HE CAME FROM; AND FILE A NEAR MISS RPT.

MY STUDENT AND I REALLY DIDN'T HAVE SUFFICIENT TIME TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION FOR AVOIDANCE DUE TO THE POS OF THE OTHER ACFT WHEN FIRST SEEN. TOO CLOSE; TOO QUICK. I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE TWR DIDN'T HAVE THIS TARGET ON THEIR RADAR SCOPE. THE FAA CHKED BOTH TWR RADAR AND APCH RADAR TO NO AVAIL.

THE FLT RETURNING TO LGB WAS A TRAINING FLT IN PREPARATION FOR THE COMMERCIAL LICENSE. THE LNDG AT TRM WAS FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE 'TAXI BACK' AND TKOF. ALONG THE RETURN RTE OF FLT; BOTH PSP ATIS AND RIV ATIS WERE USED TO GATHER CURRENT ALTIMETER SETTINGS. IN THE VICINITY OF AJO (AT SANTA ANA CANYON) WE ATTEMPTED TO TUNE LGB ATIS. AT THIS TIME; THE RADIO MALFUNCTIONED AND WOULD NOT XFER THE FREQ FROM 'STANDBY' TO 'ACTIVE' WITH RIV ATIS STUCK IN THE 'ACTIVE.' AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO SWITCH FREQS; WE THEN TURNED THE UNIT OFF TO LET IT COOL DOWN AND PERHAPS THEREBY BECOME FUNCTIONAL ONCE AGAIN (WHICH IT DID NOT). THE FIRST ERROR IN PLT JUDGEMENT OCCURRED WHEN A TIME CHK WAS MADE IMMEDIATELY SUBSEQUENT TO THE RADIO FAILURE. WITH DEAD RECKONING ESTIMATES; WE FIGURED WE WOULD REACH THE BORDER OF LGB AIRSPACE AFTER THE TWR HAD CLOSED. WE THEN INITIATED A DSCNT FROM 6500 FT TO 2000 FT MSL IN PREPARATION FOR LNDG. WE ALSO KNEW THERE WOULD NOT BE AN AIRSPACE CONFLICT AT FUL OR SLI; BOTH LYING DIRECTLY ALONG OUR PLOTTED COURSE; AS THE TWRS AT THOSE ARPTS HAD CLOSED. WE LATER DISCOVERED THAT OUR ERROR IN DEAD RECKONING WAS EXACERBATED BY A WATCH SET 5 MINS FAST. THE SECOND ERROR IN JUDGEMENT OCCURRED WHEN WE DECIDED NOT TO USE THE LOST COM XPONDER CODE 7600. THE SKEWED REASONING BEHIND THIS DECISION WAS THAT SINCE WE EXPECTED LGB TO BE CLOSED AT THE TIME OF OUR ARR; WE DID NOT THINK ANYONE WOULD BE PRESENT TO OBSERVE THE 7600 CODE. WHAT WE DID NOT ACCOUNT FOR AT THE TIME WAS THE POTENTIAL FOR INST APCHS FROM SOCAL INTO LGB WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO USE THIS INFO. WE REALIZED THAT WE MAY HAVE CAUSED A TFC CONFLICT WITH A CESSNA CITATION THAT LANDED 10 MINS AFTER WE DID. THE NEXT ERROR IN PLT CONDUCT OCCURRED AFTER OUR FLT ENTERED LGB CLASS D AIRSPACE. AT THIS TIME; WE WERE SEARCHING FOR TFC AND PLANNING OUR APCH TO RWY 30. APPROX 1 MI S OF THE 91 FREEWAY WBOUND AT 2000 FT AND ABEAM THE TWR; I BRIEFLY GLANCED AT THE TWR. AT THIS TIME; I DID NOT OBSERVE A LIGHT-GUN SIGNAL; NOR DID I EXPECT TO SEE ONE. WE CONTINUED OUR TFC PATTERN BY ENTERING L DOWNWIND FOR RWY 30; AND THEN LANDED ON THE RWY. WE SHOULD HAVE SPENT MORE TIME LOOKING AT THE TWR. THE REALIZATION OF OUR ERROR OCCURRED WHEN THE LGB POLICE HELI TRAINED ITS SPOTLIGHT ON OUR ACFT AS WE MOVED ALONG TXWY G. IN HINDSIGHT; WE REALIZE THAT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE CUT OUR PLANNING SO CLOSE; AND THAT WE SHOULD HAVE CONFIRMED THE ACTUAL TIME/OP OF THE TWR BEFORE XING LGB AIRSPACE. WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR LIGHT-GUN SIGNALS. WE COULD HAVE DIVERTED TO CPM (COMPTON); A NEAR-BY NON TWRED ARPT. THERE; WE COULD HAVE MADE A CELL PHONE CALL TO RECEIVE LGB ATIS; CONFIRMING THAT THE TWR WAS INDEED OPEN/CLOSED. HAD WE THEN DISCOVERED THAT THE TWR WAS OPEN; WE COULD HAVE CALLED THE TWR; NOTIFIED THEM OF OUR PREDICAMENT AND COORD ENTRY TO LGB AIRSPACE AND LNDG AT THE ARPT. I HAVE CONTACTED CAFI/SAFETY COUNSELOR IN REGARDS TO THIS MATTER. I HAVE SCHEDULED GND/FLT TRAINING COVERING LOST COM PROCS AND LIGHT-GUN SIGNALS. I HAVE INCLUDED THE IMPORTANCE OF LOST COM AND INTERCEPTION PROCS INTO MY SYLLABUS; AND PLAN TO INSTRUCT MY STUDENTS ON THE DETAILS OF LOST COM; INCLUDING DEMONSTRATIONS OF LIGHT-GUN SIGNALS FROM THE TWR. I ALSO PLAN TO INFORM ALL OF MY FLYING ACQUAINTANCES OF MY ERROR SO THAT THEY MAY NEVER REPEAT MY MISTAKE.

HOWEVER; THE C152 BADLY OBSTRUCTS THIS VIEW SOMEWHAT. MOST IMPORTANTLY; HOWEVER; I KNOW NOW TO BE VERY CAREFULLY WHEN XING THE EXTENDED RWY CTRLINE OF OTHER ARPTS; EVEN IF I AM SEVERAL MI FROM THEM. THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT MANY PLTS FLY STRAIGHT OUT FROM THIS ARPT (WATTS/WOODLAND) IN HIGH-PERFORMANCE AIRPLANES ENRTE TO MORE POPULOUS SOUTHERN AREAS (SAN FRANCISCO). THIS IS BECAUSE THERE IS A MAINT FACILITY AT THIS ARPT THAT SVCS MANY FAST; HIGH PERFORMANCE AIRPLANES SUCH AS THE PLANE I ALMOST COLLIDED WITH.

THE PATTERN AND CTAF WERE FULL OF PLANES AND POS RPTS. A MALE VOICE ON THE GND OFFERED ADVICE TO ANY PLTS WHO SEEMED UNAWARE OF THE PROX OF OTHER PLANES AND SEVERAL TIMES INTERVENED TO HELP PLANES DEPART; ASKING PLTS IN THE PATTERN TO CIRCLE WHILE SEVERAL PLANES BACK-TAXIED THE SINGLE RWY. IT WAS UNCLR TO ME WHETHER HE WAS AN AUTH; BUT HE WAS VERY HELPFUL GETTING US IN AND OUT OF THE STRIP. THERE MAY HAVE BEEN AS MANY AS 80 PLANES ON THE FIELD AT THE HT OF THE FLY-IN. THE APCH END OF RWY 20 HAD BEEN USED ALL DAY AS A PRIMARY PEDESTRIAN XING AND PEOPLE WERE PASSING BTWN MY PLANE AND THE ONES ON EITHER SIDE; AND ALSO XING IN FRONT OF MY PLANE FROM SIDE-TO-SIDE.

SEEING NO ALTERNATIVES TO INCREASE THE SAFETY OF THE SIT; I DETERMINED TO MOVE MY PLANE INTO THE DEP SEQUENCE AS SOON AS WAS PRACTICAL AFTER STARTING UP. I HAD SEEN NOTHING BUT DEPS FOR THE PREVIOUS 1/2 HR AND DURING THE LONG AND NERVOUS MIN BEFORE I PULLED OUT TO DEPART I HEARD NOTHING BUT POS RPTS OF PLANES DEPARTING THE PATTERN IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS. FOR THE MOMENT THERE WERE NO PLANES IN LINE TO LEAVE THE RAMP AREA ACROSS FROM ME AND THE PLT OF THE CESSNA THAT WAS FIRST IN LINE ON MY SIDE OF THE RWY WAS TURNING AROUND AND ADDRESSING SOME SIT IN HIS REAR SEATS. I LOOKED TO THE N; BEYOND HIM AND COULD SEE NO PLANE ABOVE THE TREE TOPS WHICH WERE ABOUT 200 FT AWAY. I PULLED OUT AND ROLLED R INTO A SOFT-FIELD DEP; STAYING IN GND EFFECT TO BUILD UP MY SPD. AS I RAISED THE NOSE TO CLB; I SAW A C172 PASSING ABOVE ME; IN LINE WITH THE RWY; ABOUT 100 FT ABOVE ME. I WAS DOING ABOUT 65 MPH (MY ASI DISPLAYS MPH) AND HE WAS CLBING; DOING ABOUT THE SAME SPD; JUST AHEAD OF ME. I CHKED TO BE SURE I WOULD CLR THE TREES AT THE END OF THE RWY AND HELD THE PLANE AT ABOUT 150 FT AGL AS HE CLBED; STAYING ONLY A WINGS LENGTH TO MY R BUT RAPIDLY INCREASING HIS LEAD AND ALT ABOVE ME. I KEPT MY PLANE LOW UNTIL HE TURNED XWIND IN FRONT OF ME AND I DEPARTED TO THE S; AS PLANNED. I MADE AN ASSUMPTION (TO CALL AN ASSUMPTION FOOLISH IS REDUNDANT) THAT THE STREAM OF DEPARTING PLANES WOULD CONTINUE UNINTERRUPTED. I COULDN'T SEE FAR ENOUGH UP FINAL TO SPOT A PLANE ON A LOW APCH. I ALSO ASSUMED THAT A MIN OF RADIO LISTENING WOULD HAVE WARNED ME THAT A PLANE WAS LNDG. I ALLOWED A SINGLE SAFETY CONCERN TO SO DOMINATE MY ATTN THAT MY DANGEROUS IMPATIENCE SEEMED TO ME PRUDENCE.

WE RECEIVED A WX BRIEFING FROM FLT SVC FOR OUR RTE OF FLT. WE PLANNED OUR RTE OF FLT VIA PILOTAGE TO GIF (NON TWRED FIELD). WE DEPARTED ISM (CTLED AIRFIELD) ABOUT 15 MINS BEFORE DUCK. ABOUT 10 MI SW FROM KISSIMMEE; WE FLEW OVER OUR FIRST LANDMARK. AFTER THAT; WE ALTERED OUR COURSE TOWARDS GIF; WHICH WAS ABOUT A WESTERLY HEADING. ABOUT THIS TIME; IT WAS DARK AND WE WERE USING ROADS AND LARGE LAKES TO LOCATE OUR POS. WE LOOKED FOR THE ARPT BEACON AND FOUND ONE THAT WAS DIRECTLY AHEAD OF US. ONCE WE SAW THE ARPT BEACON; WE LOOKED AT THE SECTIONAL CHART TO VERIFY THAT THIS WAS OUR DEST. WE WERE SURE THAT THIS WAS OUR DEST BECAUSE THERE WAS A ROAD N OF THE FIELD AND ALSO A LAKE. ABOUT 10 MI FROM THE FIELD; WE RECEIVED THE CURRENT WX CONDITIONS AND BEGAN XMITTING OUR INTENTIONS ON THE CTAF. THE WINDS AT GIF WERE FAVORING RWY 22. AS WE GOT CLOSER TO THE ARPT (ABOUT 5 MI); WE SAW WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS RWY 22. WE CALLED OUT OUR INTENTIONS OF FLYING OVER THE FIELD; JUST TO VERIFY THE WINDS AND LOOK FOR OTHER TFC WHO MIGHT BE IN THE PATTERN. WE HEARD OVER THE CTAF THAT SOMEONE WAS IN THE PATTERN DOING TOUCH AND GOES BUT COULD NOT SEE THEM. ONCE WE GOT CLOSER TO THE ARPT; WE WERE AT 1500 FT MSL AND WE POSITIONED OURSELVES SO THAT WE COULD SEE THE WINDSOCK AND THE OTHER TFC. ONCE WE GOT OVER THE FIELD; WE LOOKED DOWN TO FIND THE WINDSOCK AT THIS POINT AND COULDN'T FIND IT. SO WE STARTED TO SET UP FOR THE RWY THAT THE OTHER ACFT WAS USING. WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO WAS FLY SWBOUND AND THEN TEAR DROP AROUND TO ENTER 45 DEGS TO THE L DOWNWIND FOR RWY 22. AS WE TURNED SWBOUND; I LOOKED DOWN AT THE RWY AND I FAINTLY NOTICED THE RWY NUMBER; IT WAS RWY 27; THEN I NOTICED THAT THE ARPT CONFIGN DIDN'T MATCH GIF. ONCE I REALIZED THAT WE WERE AT THE WRONG ARPT; I TOLD THE STUDENT TO BEGIN A CLB AND HEAD BACK TO WHICH WE CAME FROM. AS WE WERE CLBING OUT AND HEADING OUT OF THE AREA; I WAS REVIEWING THE SECTIONAL TO LOCATE OUR POS. I TOLD THE STUDENT TO FLY TOWARDS THAT FIRST POINT THAT WE USED TO GET TO GIF; WHICH WAS A LARGE LAKE. AS WE PROGRESSED TO THAT POINT; I CONTINUED TO LOCATE OUR POS. AS WE PROGRESSED FURTHER; WE SAW GIF OFF OUR L WING AND THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED WE MUST HAVE FLOWN OVER BOW (WHICH IS A TWRED FIELD). THE PROB AROSE FROM THE DISORIENTATION OF OUR POS DUE TO NIGHTFALL. ANOTHER FACTOR THAT CONTRIBUTED TOWARDS THE PROB; CONTINUING WHEN WE SAW WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS THE RWY THAT WE WOULD BE USING; NOT LOOKING AROUND FOR OTHER BEACONS TO VERIFY WHAT WE HAVE DETERMINED; CONTINUING OUR HEADING TOWARDS THE ARPT; EVEN THOUGH WE DIDN'T SEE THE OTHER ACFT WHO WAS IN THE PATTERN; THESE ARPTS LIE TOWARDS THE EDGE OF DIFFERENT CHARTS AND WE WERE USING THE CHART ONLY FOR GIF. IF WE LOOKED AT THE OTHER CHART; WE PROBABLY COULD HAVE LOCATED OUR POS A LITTLE BIT BETTER AND IT COULD HAVE HELPED US FIND GIF AND AVOID BOW. THE DISCOVERY OCCURRED WHEN WE WERE OVER THE ARPT AND I REALIZED THAT WE WERE AT THE WRONG ARPT. THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WE TOOK WERE A CLB AND HEADING BACK FROM WHICH WE CAME AND THEN DETERMINE OUR POS. ONCE WE GOT ON THE GND; WE WENT OVER WHAT HAD HAPPENED; WE LOOKED AT THE CHARTS AND REALIZED THAT THE ROAD AND LAKE WERE VERY SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS FOR BOTH ARPTS AND THAT WE SHOULD HAVE USE OTHER LANDMARKS.",,,,"C152 CFI AND STUDENT MISTOOK BOW; A TWRED ARPT; FOR GIF; AN UNCTLED FIELD AND ENTERED BOW'S CLASS D AIRSPACE WITHOUT CLRNC.",

I VISUALLY INSPECTED THE FUEL TANKS DURING PREFLT TO VERIFY THAT THE FUEL LEVEL ON THE LONG RANGE TANKS WAS TOUCHING THE BOTTOM OF THE COLLAR. THIS SHOULD HAVE GIVEN ME 24.5 GALS USABLE FUEL. THE MANUAL SAYS THE RANGE FOR THIS AMOUNT AT 65% PWR SHOULD BE 4 HRS AND 30 MINS RESERVE. I ONLY PLANNED ON 4 HRS. MY FLT PLAN WAS FOR 2 HRS 46 MINS TOTAL. I FILED FOR 3 HRS 16 MINS TO ALLOW FOR POSSIBLE STOPS AT 2 ARPTS OR TO ALLOW FOR STRONGER THAN FORECAST WINDS. I NOTICED BEFORE TKOF THAT THE FUEL GAUGES WERE READING HALF AND LESS; AND DECIDED THEY WERE READING ABOUT 3 GALS LOW EACH. I HAD MADE THIS SAME XCOUNTRY WITH MY INSTRUCTOR IN THE REVERSE DIRECTION JUST 4 DAYS BEFORE IN THE SAME ACFT WITH THE SAME FUEL LOAD. WE STOPPED ENRTE ABOUT 1 HR FROM HOME AND REVIEWED THE FUEL USAGE AND VISUALLY CHKED THE TANKS. FUEL USAGE WAS TO SPECS. WE COMPLETED THE FLT WITH 3.2 HRS ON THE HOBBS AND AN ESTIMATED 6+ GALS LEFT ON A MUCH WARMER DAY. THEREFORE I FELT CONFIDENT THAT 24.5 GALS (4 HRS) WOULD BE ENOUGH WITH UP TO 75 MINS RESERVE. THE FIRST LEG OF THE TRIP WENT AS PLANNED TO THE MIN. ON THE SECOND LEG I FELL BEHIND SCHEDULE BY 15 MINS AND ATTRIBUTED THIS TO STRONGER WINDS. I ELECTED NOT TO LAND AT THE SECOND ARPT BECAUSE OF THE HIGH WINDS. I HAD ANTICIPATED THIS MIGHT BE THE CASE AND HAD A THIRD ARPT IN MIND FURTHER ON IN A LESS WINDY AREA. I ALSO THOUGHT THAT BY CUTTING THE CORNER AND HEADING BACK THE OTHER DIRECTION; MY HEADWIND WOULD BECOME A TAILWIND AND I COULD MAKE UP SOME TIME. AT THIS POINT I NOTICED THAT ONE OF THE FUEL GAUGES WAS READING EMPTY. I FOUND THIS QUITE WORRISOME; BUT I HAD BEEN IN THE AIR ONLY 2 HRS 28 MINS; AND THOUGHT THAT THE GAUGE HAD TO BE WRONG; ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT HAD BEEN ON EMPTY. THE ENG SEEMED TO BE RUNNING NORMALLY; AND I WAS CAREFUL TO MAINTAIN 2400 RPMS (65% PWR) ALT 7500 FT. AT 2 HRS 52 MINS; AS I WAS DSNDING AT 100 KIAS; PREPARING TO LAND AT MY ALTERNATE; THE ENG BEGAN TO SPUTTER. IT RECAUGHT AT LEAST 5 OR 6 TIMES. I'M NOT SURE WHAT MY ALT WAS WHEN IT DIED; AROUND 1000 FT AGL OR LESS I WOULD GUESS. FORTUNATELY THERE WERE WIDE OPEN DRY WHEAT FIELDS ALL AROUND; AND I LANDED WITHOUT DAMAGE TO PERSON OR PROPERTY. THE TIME WAS XA54 LCL. THE HOBBS READ EXACTLY 3 HRS. ON THE GND; I TRIED TO CONTACT FSS; FLIGHT-WATCH; ATC AND A NEARBY UNICOM WITHOUT SUCCESS. FINALLY I RECEIVED A RESPONSE FROM A GOOD SAMARITAN IN THE AIR AT THE ARPT I WAS HEADING FOR. SHE CAME OUT AND LOCATED ME AND RELAYED A MESSAGE TO MY HOME FBO. I CHKED THE FUEL TANKS. THE R ONE WAS EMPTY; BUT THE L ONE CONTAINED 4.5 GALS ACCORDING TO THE MEASURING STICK. I SHOULD HAVE HAD 6.4 GALS. I BELIEVE THE ENG WAS HAVING SUBTLE PERFORMANCE PROBS; NOT DEVELOPING THE PWR IT SHOULD HAVE FOR THE RPM SETTING. I THINK THIS ACCOUNTS FOR THE SLOWER GND SPD BECAUSE ON THE LAST 12 NM I WAS ONLY GETTING 80 KTS GND SPD WITH AN 8 KT TAILWIND (FORECAST). IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN 103 KTS. YET IT WAS USING FUEL AT A HIGHER RATE. THE BIGGEST PROB WAS THE FAILURE TO FEED THE LAST 4.5 GALS IN THE L WING. EVEN WITH THE SLOWER GND SPD AND HIGHER FUEL BURN; 4.5 GALS SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN ME ALL THE WAY HOME; ALBEIT WITH NO RESERVE; BUT I WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN THAT WITHOUT CHKING THE TANKS UPON LNDG. IF THE FUEL BURN HAD BEEN NORMAL I WOULD HAVE GOT HOME 15 MINS LATER THAN FILED; BUT WITH THE HALF HR RESERVE. I DON'T THINK I JUST MISJUDGED THE FUEL LEVEL. AT LEAST 3 PEOPLE CHKED IT. ME; MY INSTRUCTOR; AND THE PERSON WHO FILLED IT. I'M NOT A MECH; BUT I DON'T SEE HOW THE OWNER; MY INSTRUCTOR OR I COULD HAVE KNOWN IN ADVANCE OR PREVENTED THIS COMBINATION OF ACFT PERFORMANCE PROBS. THE FLT PLAN WAS GOOD; THE EXECUTION WAS GOOD; BUT THE ACFT FAILED. IT'S EASY TO SAY' YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE TO THE NEAREST ARPT WHEN YOU FIRST NOTICED A POSSIBLE FUEL PROB; REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH FUEL YOU SHOULD HAVE HAD.' AT THE TIME; THE NEAREST ARPT WAS STILL 10 NM AWAY IN A HEADWIND. WITH 20/20 HINDSIGHT; IF I HAD GONE THERE; I PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE MADE IT; AND WOULD HAVE GONE DOWN IN A POPULATED AREA INSTEAD OF A NICE BIG WHEATFIELD. FURTHERMORE; I WAS RIGHT ABOUT NOT BEING OUT OF GAS. THE ENG QUIT WITH 45 MINS OF FUEL IN THE L TANK. ALL IN ALL I THINK I HAD THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOME. THE ONLY THING I COULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY WAS TO HAVE ANTICIPATED IMMINENT ENG FAILURE AND SET IT DOWN IN A FIELD WHILE I STILL HAD PWR. LESSON LEARNED: 1) ALWAYS FILL YOUR TANKS TO THE TOP; ESPECIALLY ON XCOUNTRIES AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOUR RTE COVERS RURAL AREAS. ABOUT THE TIME I THINK THE PROB MAY HAVE STARTED ON LEG 2; WHEN MY GND SPD STARTED TO DETERIORATE; I WAS 30 NM FROM FUEL. 2) FLT PLAN FOR 1 HR RESERVE. 3) STOP AND FILL UP WHEN YOUR GAUGES READ LOW EVEN IF YOU KNOW THEY'RE WRONG. 4) ALWAYS CARRY A CELL PHONE. 5) ALL OF THE ABOVE WON'T SAVE YOU FROM ENG FAILURE. 6) IF YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE IN TROUBLE; AVOID ARPTS THAT ARE SURROUNDED BY HOUSES; A FIELD WOULD BE BETTER. 7) THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN A FORCED LNDG IS NOT ABOUT GETTING MAX GLIDE OR LNDG INTO THE WIND; IT'S ABOUT TOUCHING DOWN WHERE YOU HAVE ROOM TO ROLL OUT WITHOUT HITTING ANYTHING.

ACCORDING TO THE ARPT FACILITY DIRECTOR; THERE IS NO CALM WIND RWY; BUT RWY 17 IS GENERALLY USED. ANOTHER FACTOR IN THIS SIT WAS THE PA28'S CLOSER THAN USUAL POSITIONING OF ITS BASE LEG.

WE CALLED ZZZ TWR; WHILE AT AN ALT OF 4500 FT MSL; TO REQUEST LNDG. THE TWR HAD TOLD US TO MAKE A L DSNDING 270 DEG TURN TO LOSE ALT; PRIOR TO ENTERING THE TFC PATTERN. WE COMPLIED; AND STARTED DOWN. WE WERE DSNDING AT ABOUT 1000 FPM; TO GET DOWN TO PATTERN ALT EXPEDITIOUSLY. AFTER MAKING THE 270 DEG TURN; OUR ALTIMETER STILL INDICATED THAT WE WERE AT ONLY ABOUT 3000 FT; SO WE REQUESTED AND RECEIVED CLRNC TO CONTINUE WITH OUR DSNDING TURN. AS WE CONTINUED INTO THE SECOND TURN; I BEGAN TO SUSPECT THE ALTIMETER. THE VSI WAS SHOWING A STEADY DSCNT AT 800-1000 FPM; BUT AS BOTH MY STUDENT AND I COMPARED THE VIEW OUT THE WINDOW WITH THE INDICATED ALT; THE TWO DID NOT AGREE. WE APPEARED TO BE LOWER THAN THE ALTIMETER INDICATED. I POINTED THIS OUT TO MY STUDENT; AND ASKED WHAT HE SAW. WE BOTH AGREED IT DID NOT LOOK RIGHT. AT THAT POINT; AS IT LOOKED LIKE WE WERE IN FACT LOWER THAN THE 2600 FT THAT THE ALTIMETER INDICATED; I CALLED TWR TO ASK WHAT THEY SHOWED FOR US ON THEIR RADAR. THE TWR REPLIED THAT OUR MODE 'C' WAS INDICATING ONLY 600 FT MSL! I KNEW WE WERE LOW; BUT NOT THAT LOW! WE IMMEDIATELY APPLIED FULL PWR; AND CLBED BACK UP TO WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS AN APPROPRIATE PATTERN ALT. DURING THIS TIME; OUR VSI WAS SHOWING A CLB; WHILE THE ALTIMETER CONTINUED TO SHOW A DSCNT. THROUGHOUT THIS; THE AIRSPD APPEARED TO OPERATE NORMALLY. IN THE MEANTIME; WE TAPPED ON THE INST; SINCE IT SEEMED TO BE STUCK; BUT NOTHING HAPPENED. WE LEVELED OFF CLOSE TO PATTERN ALT; WITHOUT HAVING AN ALTIMETER TO REF. AGAIN; I CALLED TWR TO ASK FOR OUR MODE 'C' READOUT; AND THEY TOLD ME 900 FT. AT THAT POINT; WE WERE DOWNWIND ABEAM THE NUMBERS; AND TWR ASKED US IF WE COULD MAKE A 'SHORT APCH;' AS THEY HAD A HAWKER ON FINAL. I SAID YES; AND WE TURNED TOWARDS THE RWY TO COMPLY. THE ALTIMETER WAS STILL MALFUNCTIONING; BUT THE VSI APPEARED TO BE WORKING. AGAIN WHEN I WAS ON SHORT FINAL; I AGAIN TAPPED THE ALTIMETER; AND IT SUDDENLY BECAME 'UNSTUCK;' RAPIDLY UNWINDING; SPINNING; IN A BLUR; UNTIL IT STOPPED ABRUPTLY AT ABOUT 200 FT MSL. THEN; IT SUDDENLY APPEARED TO OPERATE NORMALLY; AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED. THE RESULTANT LNDG WAS UNEVENTFUL. AFTER WE WERE ON THE GND; IT INDICATED THE PROPER FIELD ELEVATION FOR ZZZ. WHILE ON THE GND; IT OPERATED NORMALLY. AFTER LNDG; I ASKED THE TWR; BEFORE I LEFT THE FREQ; IF THERE WAS ANY PROB WITH OUR BEING SO LOW; WELL BELOW PATTERN ALT; AND KNOWING THE NOISE SENSITIVITY OF THE AREA. BUT; THE TWR DID NOT REPLY; OR THEY DID NOT HEAR US. DURING THE TIME THAT THIS HAPPENED; THEY DID NOT MAKE ANY MENTION OF OUR BEING LOW; WITH A LOW ALT ALERT; AS WE WERE WELL BELOW TFC PATTERN ALT; NOR DID THEY QUESTION OUR LOW ALT; EVEN WHEN I CALLED. THEY JUST CALMLY STATED OUR ALT AS 600 FT. WE DID HAVE THE CORRECT ALTIMETER SETTING IN THE KOLLSMAN WINDOW.

I FEEL IMPORTANT DETAILS TO CONSIDER INCLUDE THE FACT THAT I WAS PART OF A GROUP OF ACFT ALL FLYING THE SAME RTE; ONE OF WHICH WAS ALSO A C152 WHICH DEPARTED ROUGHLY 15-20 MINS EARLIER. ALSO; THIS WAS MY FIRST XCOUNTRY OF THIS MAGNITUDE AND I RELIED TOO MUCH ON THE INPUT OF THE MORE EXPERIENCED MEMBERS OF THE GROUP WHEN IT CAME TO FLT PLANNING.

WE ALL AGREED THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE IT TO OUR DEST WITH THE REQUIRED 30 MINS OF RESERVE FUEL FOR DAY VFR FLT. OBVIOUSLY; THIS WAS NOT THE CASE.

I HAD VISUALLY VERIFIED THAT THE FUELER HAD TOPPED THE TANKS PER MY REQUEST. I ALSO PERFORMED A VERY THOROUGH PREFLT INSPECTION OF THE ACFT. AS FAR AS FUEL PLANNING; WHEN FLYING THIS SPECIFIC ACFT AT LOW ALTS WITH PROPER LEANING; IT CAN USUALLY BE OPERATED FOR 3 HRS 50 MINS; WITH A 30 MIN VFR FUEL RESERVE. THIS IS THE ENDURANCE WINDOW THAT I WAS USING FOR MY FLT. WHILE I WAS NEARING CMH I WAS STARTING TO GET NEAR THE END OF THIS ENDURANCE WINDOW. I KNEW THAT I STILL HAD 1 MORE SITE TO SHOOT THAT WAS 2 MI SE OF THE FIELD. AT THIS TIME; ACCORDING TO MY FUEL PLANNING; I SHOULD HAVE HAD ABOUT 30 MINS OF FUEL LEFT BEFORE I GOT TO MY 30 MIN RESERVE. THE ONLY THING THAT WAS GETTING TO ME WAS THE FACT THAT THE FUEL GAUGES WERE GETTING VERY LOW. I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE; I RE-LEANED THE PLANE AND VERIFIED BOTH OF THE MAGS WERE FIRING WELL. I THOUGHT THROUGH EVERYTHING THAT I HAD BEEN TAUGHT ABOUT THE COMMON INACCURACY OF FUEL GAUGES IN ACFT. I TOOK INTO ACCOUNT MY RECENT EXPERIENCES IN ACFT THAT HAD 1-2 HRS OF FUEL ON BOARD EVEN THOUGH THE GAUGES INDICATED THAT THEY WERE COMPLETELY EMPTY. I ALSO CONSIDERED THAT EVEN IF SOMETHING WERE TO GO WRONG WHILE I WAS OVER THE SITE THAT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE A PWR OFF LNDG SO I DECIDED THAT I NEEDED TO TRUST MY FUEL PLANNING; AS THAT IS THE MOST ACCURATE MEANS OF KNOWING MY FUEL STATE. I MADE MY FIRST CIRCLE OF THE SITE AT 2500 FT MSL AND AS I CAME AROUND THE N SIDE OF THE TARGET MY ENG BEGAN TO SURGE. I IMMEDIATELY TURNED N TO ESTABLISH A BASE LEG FOR THE RWY. I WAS ALREADY ON WITH TWR DUE TO MY PROX TO THE FIELD; I TOLD THEM THAT I NEEDED TO LAND AND THAT I WAS HAVING FUEL TROUBLE. THE TWR CTLR CLRED ME TO LAND IMMEDIATELY; AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY VOIDED THE CLRNC FOR AN AIRLINER THAT WAS ON A LONG FINAL FOR THE RWY. DUE TO THE FACT THAT RWY 28L WAS CLOSED AND HAD PEOPLE AND EQUIP ON IT; I HAD TO GO FOR THE N RWY (RWY 28R). THE WINDS WERE 220 DEGS AT 17 KTS GUSTING TO 21 KTS. THIS DID NOT HELP MY CAUSE; BUT IT DID APPEAR THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THE RWY; I FOOLISHLY ADDED 10 DEGS OF FLAPS. ON SHORT FINAL; I ROUNDED OUT OVER THE BLAST PAD. THE THRESHOLD LIGHTS WERE DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME AND MY INTENTION WAS TO AVOID HITTING THEM WITH MY LNDG GEAR. I COULD SEE THE MAIN GEAR ON MY L SO I AIMED IT IN BTWN 2 OF THE LIGHTS; AS I GOT CLOSE I TRIED TO BRING THE RIGHT SIDE UP WITH BANK TO CLR THE LIGHTS; BUT UNFORTUNATELY I HIT ONE OF THEM. I TOLD THE TWR OVER THE RADIO 'I THINK I TAGGED ONE OF YOUR REILS.' THE TWR SAID THEY WOULD CHK ON IT. DURING THIS BIT OF CONVERSATION; I MADE A CTLED LNDG ON THE RWY AND WAS ROLLING OUT. THE TWR ASKED IF I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO COST CLR OF THE RWY AND I INFORMED HIM THAT I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO; BUT I WOULD LET HIM KNOW IF I COULDN'T MAKE IT. I DID MAKE IT ONTO THE FIRST AVAILABLE TXWY; THEN GOT OUT AND PUSHED IT CLR. GND SPOKE TO ME AND SAID THAT THEY WERE SENDING A TUG. AFTER THE TOW FUEL WAS ADDED TO THE PLANE AND AFTER MEETING WITH THE ARPT AUTH OVER THE BROKEN LIGHT; AND MEETING WITH 2 GENTLEMEN FROM THE COLUMBUS FSDO; AT THEIR REQUEST I STARTED THE PLANE. THIS MADE IT CLR THAT FUEL EXHAUSTION WAS CLRLY THE CULPRIT. AS PART OF AN ASSIGNMENT FROM MY EMPLOYER; I RAN THE NUMBERS AGAIN TO SEE WHY I RAN OUT OF FUEL 20 MINS BEFORE I WAS SUPPOSED TO REACH MY VFR RESERVE. THE DECIDING FACTOR WAS THAT I PLANNED WITH A PWR SETTING OF 2300 RPM BUT DUE TO THE WINDS I WAS ACTUALLY RUNNING A PWR SETTING 2400 RPM WITHOUT THINKING OF THE DIFFERENCE THAT THIS WOULD MAKE IN MY ENDURANCE NUMBERS; WHICH IS A 35 MIN DIFFERENCE PER THE MANUAL.

DUE TO THIS DISTR; I FEEL THAT I HAD FORGOTTEN TO UPDATE MY FLT PLAN TO FLY DUE S RATHER THAN CONTINUE ON MY HDG OF 197 DEGS.

AFTER A FEW MOMENTS; I SAW WHAT I THOUGHT WAS RAMONA ARPT AND STARTED DSNDING FROM 6500 FT TO 2600 FT. AS I GOT CLOSER TO THE ARPT; I REALIZED THAT IT WAS NOT RAMONA ARPT. ONCE I REALIZED IT WAS NOT; I IMMEDIATELY STARTED TO CLB AND CONTACTED RAMONA ARPT; WHO IN TURN HAD ME CONTACT SOCAL APCH. SOCAL APCH THEN GAVE ME A HDG TO FOLLOW TO GET TO RAMONA. WHAT I DID NOT REALIZE WAS THAT I HAD ENTERED THE RESTR AIRSPACE AT CAMP PENDLETON. WHEN I LANDED AT RAMONA ARPT I WAS TOLD BY THE RAMONA TWR THAT I NEEDED TO CONTACT CAMP PENDLETON TO EXPLAIN WHY I HAD VIOLATED THEIR AIRSPACE. I WAS UNABLE TO CONTACT THEM; AS I COULD NOT FIND A PHONE. AFTER REFUELING; I DEPARTED RAMONA ARPT AND HEADED BACK TO LONG BEACH. ONCE AT LONG BEACH; I WAS ALSO UNABLE TO FIND A PHONE TO CALL CAMP PENDLETON. THE FOLLOWING MORNING I CONTACTED CAMP PENDLETON TO EXPLAIN MY ACTIONS. I WAS TOLD THAT THE MATTER WOULD BE REFERRED TO FSDO AS I HAD VIOLATED THE RESTR AREA AIRSPACE. I EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT I AM A STUDENT PLT AND HAD GOTTEN LOST ON THE WAY TO RAMONA AND HAD; IN TURN; ACCIDENTALLY ENTERED THE RESTR AIRSPACE AND APOLOGIZED. THE REASONS FOR THIS WERE; AS I WAS AN INEXPERIENCED PLT; THE FLT FROM LONG BEACH TO PALM SPRINGS TO BLYTHE TO RAMONA TO LONG BEACH WERE SLIGHTLY TOO LONG FOR A STUDENT PLT. I WOULD; THEREFORE; NOT RECOMMEND SUCH A LONG FLT TO ANY STUDENT PLTS; AS IT IS A HUGE TEST OF ENDURANCE. ALSO; AFTER LEAVING BLYTHE; I BEGAN TO FEEL HUNGRY AND TIRED. FOR THIS REASON I WAS UNABLE TO THINK STRAIGHT. DUE TO SOME TURB I WAS EXPERIENCING ON SOME OF THE WAY TO PALM SPRINGS AND MOST OF THE WAY TO BLYTHE; I WAS REQUIRED TO CONCENTRATE A LOT MORE IN ORDER TO CTL THE ACFT IN TERMS OF SAFETY AS I DID NOT WANT TO COME DOWN TO EARTH OTHER THAN LNDG THE ACFT SAFELY. I DO NOT FEEL THAT MY INSTRUCTOR IS AT FAULT; AS I SHOULD HAVE MADE THE CHANGES SUGGESTED IMMEDIATELY. WITH BETTER JUDGEMENT I FEEL THAT THIS INCIDENT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. I FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT THIS INCIDENT NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED AS I HAD ENTERED MIL AIRSPACE. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 625637: IN RETROSPECT; I REALIZE THAT OTHER STUDENTS' NEEDS WERE A CAUSE OF DISTR FOR ME. POSSIBLE PREVENTION COULD HAVE OCCURRED HAD I SIMPLY ASKED NOT TO BE BOTHERED BY OTHER STUDENTS WHILE I AM REVIEWING FLT PLANS. IN ADDITION TO THIS; I FEEL THAT TIME PRESSURES WERE A FACTOR IN THIS AIRSPACE VIOLATION. WE SHOULD HAVE STARTED EARLIER IN THE DAY SO THAT GETTING MY STUDENT OFF OF THE GND WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A FACTOR. FINALLY; FOR A STUDENT PLT; THE RTE MENTIONED ABOVE WOULD BE TOO LONG AND INVOLVED.

I MADE 3 RADIO CALLS EXPLAINING THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING THE PATTERN FOR THE LAST 3O MINS AND ARE YOU ON FREQ? I FINALLY GOT RESPONSE FROM AN APOLOGETIC PLT EXPLAINING THAT HE DID NOT HEAR US ON THE RADIO. I EXPLAINED THAT THE WINDS ARE FAVORING RWY 34. THE OTHER PLT SAID THAT HE WAS MAKING RADIO CALLS AS WELL BUT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I OR MY STUDENT HAD HEARD HIS VOICE. THE WINDS WERE BLOWING FROM THE N AT LEAST 8 KTS. FROM THERE WE PROCEEDED BACK TO PARKING AND BEFORE WE HAD COMPLETED OUR TIE-DOWN OF THE AIRPLANE THERE WERE TWO OTHER AIRPLANES IN THE PATTERN FOR THE RWY THAT WE WERE USING; RWY 34. WHAT I BELIEVE LED UP TO THE EVENT WAS THAT THE OTHER ACFT BELIEVED HE WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THE PATTERN AND HE DID NOT MAKE ANY RADIO CALLS OR EVEN LISTEN FOR THE OTHER TFC.

THIS WAS A VFR FLT THAT NECESSITATED NAVING NEAR AND POTENTIALLY THROUGH CLASS B AIRSPACE IN THE BALTIMORE AREA. I CALLED FSS TO FIND OUT ABOUT TFRS IN THE AREA AND ANY OTHER RESTRS OR ENHANCEMENTS TO THE AIRSPACE. ABOUT 10 MI FROM THE CLASS B AIRSPACE AS DEPICTED ON MY SECTIONAL CHART; I RADIOED BALTIMORE APCH. AFTER CALLING THEM A NUMBER OF TIMES; I DID NOT HEAR A REPLY TO MY CALL. THE AIR WAVES WERE EXTREMELY BUSY WITH MUCH STATIC AND VARIOUS OTHER CALLS BEING STEPPED ON. I REMAINED CLR OF THE CLASS B AIRSPACE GOING JUST UNDERNEATH THE RING AND GENERALLY IN THE DIRECTION I NEEDED TO GO. HOWEVER; DUE TO THE CONGESTION OF AIRSPACE IN THIS AREA; I PURSUED A CLASS B TRANSITION. FINALLY I BEGAN TO GET A LITTLE NERVOUS. IT WAS THEN THAT I REALIZED THAT THE SECTIONAL CHART WHICH I WAS USING FOR NAV WAS OUT OF DATE. I HAD INADVERTENTLY GRABBED 1 OF 2 SECTIONALS FOR WASHINGTON. I ALWAYS KEEP OLDER SECTIONALS AROUND TO MARK UP WITH PEN AND PENCIL; KEEPING THE NEWER ONES CLEAN AND MORE READABLE. THE ONE I MISTAKENLY SELECTED WAS INDEED OUT OF DATE (BY 8 MONTHS -- IT WAS THE PRECEDING CHART THAT HAD BEEN ISSUED). IN THE CONFUSION OF MAKING RADIO CALLS UNANSWERED; NAVING COMPLEX VFR AIRSPACE; STAYING CLR OF CLASS B AIRSPACE; ETC; I WAS ALSO USING AN OUT-OF-DATE CHART. I THEN ASKED MY FRIEND (WHO WAS ASLEEP) TO HELP ME OUT AND LOOK FOR THE CURRENT CHART WHICH I KNEW WAS IN THE PLANE. HE FINALLY FOUND IT AFTER SEVERAL MINS. JUST ABOUT THAT TIME I HEARD A RADIO CALL FROM APCH LOOKING FOR AN ACFT SQUAWKING 1200. I ASSUMED THAT THE CALL WAS MEANT FOR ME -- THE RETURN RADIO CALL FROM APCH. MY FRIEND AGAIN HELPED OUT AND ANSWERED THE CALL AND OBTAINED A SQUAWK CODE FOR ME. I STUDIED THE MORE UP-TO-DATE CHART AND WAS SHOCKED TO FIND THAT THE DC ADIZ INCLUDED THE AREA IN WHICH I WAS FLYING! -- NOT SO WITH THE PREVIOUS SECTIONAL CHART. I HAD ENTERED THE ADIZ WITHOUT OBTAINING A SQUAWK CODE AND HAD PROCEEDED ABOUT 5 MI INTO IT BEFORE GETTING A CODE. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; THE VOICE ON THE RADIO ASKED ME TO CALL A PHONE NUMBER ONCE WE LANDED. AGAIN MY FRIEND MADE THE CALL TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAD HAPPENED; AS HE IS MORE EXPERIENCED THAN I WHEN IT COMES TO THIS TYPE OF MATTER AND I; REALIZING THAT I HAD MADE A FLT INTO ADIZ AIRSPACE; THOUGH JUST A SHORT WHILE; WAS VERY SERIOUS INDEED. MY FRIEND CALLED THE NUMBER; BUT RATHER THAN LISTEN TO HIS EXPLANATION THEY SIMPLY ASKED FOR AND WERE GIVEN HIS NAME AND PLT CERTIFICATE NUMBER. ACTUALLY HE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THAT I WAS PIC BUT THEY APPARENTLY WERE SO BUSY AND RUSHED THEMSELVES THAT HE COULD NOT GET A WORD IN EDGEWISE AND SO IT WAS LEFT AT THAT. THEY PROBABLY ASSUMED THAT HE WAS PIC. HOWEVER; I HAD PLTED THE PLANE INTO AN ADIZ BY VIRTUE OF HAVING REFED THE WRONG CHART AND DID NOT HAVE THE SIT CORRECTED UNTIL I RECEIVED A SQUAWK CODE ABOUT 5-10 MI INTO THE ADIZ. I NEVER DID GET A CLASS B TRANSITION. I REMAINED ON THE CODE UNTIL EXITING THE ADIZ. I KNOW THAT ANY FLT INTO SUCH AN AIRSPACE IS VERY SERIOUS.

I LOOKED AT THE HDG INDICATOR AND CONFIRMED THAT THE HELI'S DIRECTION OF TRAVEL WAS NEARLY AT 90 DEG INTERCEPT ANGLE. I LOOKED OVER TO MY R; TOOK THE CTLS AND LIFTED (BANKED) THE R WING UP. I SAW A HELI IMMEDIATELY TO MY R AND FORWARD; HEADING DIRECTLY TOWARD US. I SAW THE L SIDE AND BELLY OF THE 'JET RANGER' TYPE HELI; INDICATING THAT IT WAS AHEAD AND SLIGHTLY ABOVE OUR ALT.

AFTER THE HELI PASSED; WHICH WAS IMMEDIATE; I THEN BROUGHT THE PLANE BACK UP TO TPA (WHICH IS 1000 FT). MY STUDENT CONTINUED THE APCH AND LNDG WITHOUT FURTHER EVENT. I AM POSITIVE THAT HAD NO EVASIVE ACTION BEEN TAKEN BY ME; THE 2 ACFT WOULD HAVE HIT. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE HELI WAS GIVEN CLRNC TO TRANSITION THE AIRPLANE ON A CERTAIN HDG OR TRANSITION. HOWEVER; IT DEVIATED FROM IT'S ORIGINAL COURSE WITHOUT CLRNC. THE PLT'S UNANTICIPATED ACTION AND DEV FROM HIS CLRNC; AS WELL AS LACK OF SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND PROCEDURAL KNOWLEDGE (HELI TPA IS 500 FT AND NORMAL TRANSITION TO THE R RWY IS 2000 FT); AS WELL AS HIS VIOLATION OF FAR 91.113 AND LACK OF EVASIVE ACTION CONTRIBUTED GREATLY TO THIS INCIDENT. THE CTLR'S AUTH TO ALLOW THE HELI TO TRANSITION THE AIRSPACE AT TPA (IF; FACT) AND LACK TO EFFECTIVELY CTL THE ACFT AFTER THE DEV FROM ASSIGNED HDG ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THIS INCIDENT.

I ACCELERATED FORWARD (360 DEG HDG) MAINTAINING ALT AND THE CESSNA DOVE AND TURNED R (120 HDG APPROX). WE CAME WITHIN 100 FT SEPARATION. I DIDN'T RECEIVE ANY TFC WARNING FROM THE TWR. I HAD A TCASII INDICATION. THE TCASII SCREEN WAS HEAVILY CLUTTERED DUE TO THE PROX WITH THE ARPT AND THE LARGE NUMBER OF ACFT IN THE AIR AND ON THE GND. IT IS NOT UNCOMMON TO RECEIVE SEVERAL WARNINGS WHEN XING OVER AN ARPT. THE TCASII IS SET OFF BY THE ACFT ON THE GND SQUAWKING MODE C. I WOULD SUGGEST THE TWR CTLR KEEP TFC OUTSIDE OF THEIR AIRSPACE IF THEY FEEL OVERLOADED OR IF SITUATIONAL AWARENESS IS LOW OR LOST.

ON THE WAY HOME; I RECEIVED FLT FOLLOWING FROM ST PETERSBURG/CLEARWATER TO ORMOND BEACH. WHILE TALKING TO TPA APCH; ALL COM WAS CLR. WHEN I WAS XFERRED OVER TO ORL APCH; ALL COM WAS CLR. ORL APCH PUT ME ON VECTORS THAT WERE EXTREMELY OFF OF MY PLANNED FLT COURSE. MY PLANNED FLT COURSE HAD ME ON A HDG OF 045 DEGS; SOME OF THE VECTORS WERE 290 DEGS; 330 DEGS; 010 DEGS. THIS I BELIEVE WAS DUE TO ORL'S HVY FLOW OF TFC. I INFORMED THE CTLR THAT I WAS EXTREMELY OFF COURSE AND IF I GOT TOO FAR N; I DID NOT WANT TO GET LOST WHEN SHE XFERRED ME TO DAYTONA APCH. SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE WOULD STAY WITH ME AND GET ME BACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK. AFTER ABOUT 15 MINS OF NOT HEARING FROM APCH; I TRIED TO CONTACT THEM. I COULD NOT HEAR A RESPONSE FROM THE CTLR; BUT I COULD HEAR OTHER PLTS. I KNEW THEY COULD HEAR THE CTLR BECAUSE THEY WOULD REQUEST MISSED APCH INSTRUCTIONS. I WOULD HEAR A MOMENT OF SILENCE; THEN THE PLT WOULD REPEAT THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT WERE ASSIGNED. I TRIED TO GET ORLANDO BACK THROUGH DIFFERENT FREQS; BUT NO RESPONSE. I SWITCHED OVER TO DAYTONA APCH AND TOLD THEM THE SIT. I COULD HEAR DAYTONA APCH LOUD AND CLR FOR ABOUT 10 MINS; BUT THEY COULD NOT GET ME ON RADAR CONTACT. THEY GAVE ME PERMISSION TO END FLT FOLLOWING BUT KEEP IN CONTACT WITH THEM IF I NEEDED ANYTHING. I PUT MYSELF ON A HDG OF 090 DEGS SO I WOULD HIT THE COAST AND FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHERE I WAS. I DID NOT THINK ANYTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE RECEIVER I JUST THOUGHT THAT I WAS SO FAR AWAY FROM ORLANDO AND DAYTONA THAT MY RADIO COULDN'T PICK THEM UP. I THEN SWITCHED OVER TO JACKSONVILLE APCH AND TOLD THEM THE SIT; THAT I WAS NOW BASICALLY LOST BECAUSE I DID NOT KNOW HOW FAR N I WAS. THEY GOT ME ON RADAR CONTACT AND INFORMED ME THAT I WAS 10 MI W OF CRAIG MUNICIPAL. NOW I KNEW WHERE I WAS; BUT I HAD BEEN IN THE AIR FOR ABOUT 2.5 HRS AND THE PLANE HOLDS ABOUT 3.5 HRS WORTH OF FUEL. SINCE THE FLT FROM CRAIG TO ORMOND IS ABOUT 40 MINS; I DECIDED TO STOP FOR FUEL AND PLAY IT SAFE. I INFORMED APCH AND SWITCHED OVER TO SAINT AUGUSTINE'S ATIS THEN TO TWR. I WAS GETTING NO RESPONSE AGAIN; THEN I FIGURED OUT THAT SAINT AUGUSTINE TWR WAS CLOSED; SO I TREATED IT AS AN UNCTLED FIELD. I SAFELY LANDED AND TAXIED TO THE FBO FOR FUEL. IT WAS THEN THAT I WAS INFORMED; BY THE MAN ON THE FUEL TRUCK; THAT I WAS WRONG ABOUT THE TWR BEING CLOSED. I READ THE TIME WRONG IN MY AFD. TWR HAD RESPONDED TO MY CALLS; I JUST COULD NOT HEAR THEM. I BELIEVE THAT MY RECEIVER WAS WORKING MOST OF THE TIME. I THINK THE REASON I LOST DAYTONA AND ORLANDO IS BECAUSE I WAS TOO FAR AWAY. ORLANDO FORGOT ABOUT ME AND THAT'S HOW I ENDED UP SO FAR N. I SHOULD HAVE KEPT MYSELF MORE SITUATIONALLY AWARE. I THINK THE FACTORS THAT MESSED UP MY AWARENESS WERE THE NIGHT FACTOR AND FATIGUE FROM A LONG DAY. I WAS ALSO CONFUSED WITH WHY THE RECEIVER ONLY WORKED SOMETIMES.

APCHING PHD; CEILINGS BEGAN TO THICKEN AND FORWARD VISIBILITY BEGAN TO DECREASE; HOWEVER SLANT VISIBILITY TO THE GND REMAINED GOOD. APPROX 6 NM FROM PHD; AKRON APCH CANCELED RADAR SVCS. I IMMEDIATELY WENT TO SQUAWK CODE 1200 AND ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT PHD UNICOM ON 122.8 FOR ARPT ADVISORIES. A CHEROKEE ON THE GND RPTED THE ACTIVE RWY AS RWY 32; AND I ANNOUNCED I WOULD ENTER A R UPWIND FOR RWY 32 ONCE I MADE VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE FIELD. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; VISUAL CONDITIONS BELOW CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY -- FIRST A FEW LOW PASSING CLOUDS; AND THEN ZERO VISIBILITY BELOW. 2 ACFT PREPARING TO DEPART RWY 32 WERE ADVISED BY ANOTHER ACFT OF SOME LOW CLOUDS W OF THE ARPT. AT 3 NM E OF PHD; I BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE TOTAL IMMERSION IN IMC. MY ALT WAS BTWN 2500-3000 FT MSL. I IMMEDIATELY INITIATED A 180 DEG TURN FROM A HDG OF 300 DEGS TO 120 DEGS. SIMULTANEOUSLY; I RE-CONTACTED AKRON APCH AND 1) ADVISED THEM OF BEING UNABLE TO LAND AT PHD DUE TO IMC; 2) ASKED THEM TO CLOSE MY ACTIVE VFR FLT PLAN; AND 3) ASKED THEM FOR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE IN FILING AN IFR FLT PLAN FOR A RETURN TO AGC. I HAD HOPED FOR AN IMMEDIATE SQUAWK CODE AND RADAR SVCS. INSTEAD; AKRON APCH REFERRED ME TO CLEVELAND FSS. I CONTACTED CLEVELAND FSS ON 122.2 AND SPENT SEVERAL MINS ATTEMPTING TO EXPLAIN TO THEM MY CURRENT SIT (IN AND OUT OF IMC) AND THE DETAILS OF MY PROPOSED FLT PLAN. CLEVELAND FSS REPEATED MY PROPOSED FLT PLAN WRONG; HAD DIFFICULTY CAPTURING MY NAME; INSISTED ON A CALCULATED TIME ENRTE TO AGC AND APPEARED TO THINK I WAS ON THE GND AT PHD; WHEN I WAS ACTUALLY IN THE AIR AND IN VARYING CONDITIONS -- NONE OF THEM ESPECIALLY FAVORABLE. EVENTUALLY; CLEVELAND FSS RETURNED ME TO AKRON APCH. UPON RETURNING TO AKRON APCH; I WAS ADVISED THEY DIDN'T HAVE MY FLT PLAN IN THE COMPUTER YET; AND INSTRUCTED ME TO TURN TO A HDG OF 360 DEGS TO AVOID PITTSBURGH CLASS B AIRSPACE. THIS TOOK ME BACK TOWARDS; OR PARALLEL TO THE WX I WAS TRYING TO BEAT. MY RECENT HDG HAD BEEN 120 DEGS; TAKING ME BACK TO THE HLG VOR WHERE I HAD JUST COME FROM AND WHERE CONDITIONS WERE GOOD. AT AN ALT OF 3000 FT MSL; I WOULD HAVE BEEN BELOW PITTSBURGH CLASS B. AFTER SEVERAL MINS; AKRON APCH ADVISED THEY WEREN'T RECEIVING MY XPONDER AND WITHOUT SUCH; THEY WOULD BE UNABLE TO ASSIST ME. I WAS ADVISED TO MAINTAIN VFR -- APPARENTLY THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND I WAS ALREADY IN AND OUT OF IMC THAT WAS WORSENING ON THEIR ASSIGNED HDG OF 360 DEGS. AFTER SEVERAL MORE MOMENTS OF CYCLING THE XPONDER; CHKING CIRCUIT BREAKERS AND RECYCLING THE NUMBERS; AKRON APCH RECEIVED MY SIGNAL AND INSTRUCTED ME TO CLB TO 5000 FT AND HEAD DIRECT HLG. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; AKRON APCH HANDED ME OFF TO PITTSBURGH APCH ON A FREQ I WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH. UPON CONTACTING PIT APCH; THEY IMMEDIATELY ADVISED ME I WAS ON THE WRONG FREQ AND TO SWITCH TO THE MORE APPROPRIATE FREQ FOR MY ALT; ACFT AND FLT PLAN. PIT APCH GAVE ME A DSCNT TO AN ALT BELOW THE CLOUDS AND I FINISHED MY IFR FLT IN VMC MAKING A VISUAL APCH TO AGC. DISAPPOINTMENTS: VFR INTO IMC IS UNACCEPTABLE. I UNDERSTAND THAT AND WAS SURPRISED HOW QUICKLY THE CONDITIONS CHANGED IN THE LAST FEW MOMENTS. HAD I NOT HAD AN INST RATING; I MIGHT HAVE MORE CRITICALLY EVALUATED THE SLOWLY CHANGING CONDITIONS EARLIER AND ABORTED THE FLT; BUT VISIBILITY TO THE GND WAS ACCEPTABLE AND MY FIRST CONTACT WITH ACFT AT PHD APPEARED FAVORABLE. ONCE IN TROUBLE; I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE RESPONSE OF AKRON APCH; AND THE DIFFICULTY I EXPERIENCED WITH CLEVELAND FSS IN FILING A FLT PLAN. I CONTINUALLY RE-EVALUATE MY COM. WAS IT MY FAILURE TO DESCRIBE MY SIT? I DON'T THINK SO. SHORT OF DECLARING AN EMER; I COULDN'T BELIEVE THEY ABANDONED ME TO FSS WITHOUT RADAR OR RADIO CONTACT. THE CONTINUAL QUESTIONING FROM FSS ABOUT MY PROPOSED RTE; HOW TO SPELL MY NAME; AND WHAT VOID TIME I WANTED WAS FRUSTRATING AT A TIME I WAS IN IMMEDIATE NEED OF RADAR SVCS AND DIRECTIONAL GUIDANCE. AND; UPON RETURN TO AKRON APCH; BEING TOLD TO MAINTAIN VFR (WHICH IS HARD TO DO WHEN YOU ARE ALREADY IN IMC) WAS NOT OF ANY HELP IN MY CURRENT SIT. I WISH I COULD REVIEW THE TAPED XMISSIONS WITH THE ATC CTLRS IN AN ATTEMPT TO ASSIST ME (AND THEM) IN UNDERSTANDING WHERE THE CONFUSION OCCURRED AND HOW TO IMPROVE OUR COMS IN THE FUTURE. PERHAPS MY RADIO XMISSION SIGNAL WAS POOR? PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE ASSERTIVE AND REFUSED TO SWITCH TO CLEVELAND FSS AND SIMPLY DEMANDED AN IMMEDIATE SQUAWK CODE AND RADAR SVCS. IT SEEMS THAT IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN AGAIN TO ME OR ANYONE ELSE; THE PROCESS OF GETTING RADAR SVCS AND AN APPROVED FLT PLAN SHOULD BE EXPEDITED. MY FIRST EXPERIENCE IN ACTUAL SINGLE PLT IFR WAS TOLERABLE; BUT I CAN MORE CLRLY THAN EVER SEE HOW A VFR PLT WITHOUT INST TRAINING COULD EASILY AUGER IN FROM THE COMBINED CONFUSION OF THE ACFT ENVIRONMENT AND THE ADDED PRESSURE FROM THE CLUMSINESS OF THE ATC/FSS ENVIRONMENT IN THIS SIT.",,,,"A PLT IN C152 VFR NEAR PHD INADVERTENTLY ENCOUNTERS IMC AND HAS DIFFICULTY OBTAINING ASSISTANCE FROM ATC.",

THE STUDENT DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS AND PROCEEDED TO APPLY UNEQUAL BRAKING ADDING TOO MUCH L BRAKE. THIS CAUSED THE AIRPLANE TO START VEERING TO THE L OF RWY CTRLINE. INSTRUCTOR STATED 'MY AIRPLANE' AND IMMEDIATELY INITIATED R RUDDER PRESSURE AND R BRAKE IN AN ATTEMPT TO STOP AIRPLANE VEERING TO THE L AND REMAIN ON THE RWY. INSTRUCTOR THEN STATED 'OFF THE BRAKES.' STUDENT DID NOT RELEASE L BRAKE UNTIL APPROX 2-3 SECONDS LATER AND STUDENT STATED 'YOUR AIRPLANE' TO THE INSTRUCTOR AT WHICH POINT THE STUDENT RELEASED ALL BRAKES AND FLT CTLS. AT THIS POINT THE AIRPLANE WAS AIMING STRAIGHT AT A RWY LIGHT APPROX 15-25 DEGS OFF RWY CTRLINE TRAVELING AT APPROX 20-25 KTS. INSTRUCTOR DETERMINED THAT IF A FURTHER ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO STAY ON THE RWY AT THIS POINT; THE AIRPLANE WOULD STILL GO OFF THE RWY AND MOST CERTAINLY HIT THE RWY LIGHT. TO AVERT; THIS INSTRUCTOR STARTED APPLYING L RUDDER PRESSURE AND USED DIFFERENTIAL BRAKING; APPLYING MORE L BRAKE THAN THE R BRAKE TO BOTH SLOW THE AIRPLANE AND TO HELP STEER THE AIRPLANE FARTHER TO THE L TO AVOID THE RWY LIGHT. AIRPLANE WENT OFF THE L SIDE OF THE RWY BTWN RWY LIGHTS INTO AN AREA OF GRASS SURROUNDING THE RWY STRAIGHTENED OUT THEN PARALLELED THE RWY WHILE SLOWING STRAIGHT AHEAD AND THEN PROCEEDED BACK ONTO THE RWY IN A CTLED MANNER. AIRPLANE DID NOT SUFFER ANY DAMAGE NOR DID ANY RWY LIGHTS. THE LCL TWR CTLR THEN ASKED IF WE HAD HIT ANYTHING AND IF WE WERE IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE. INSTRUCTOR STATED 'WE MANAGED TO MISS EVERYTHING' AND THAT WE DID NOT NEED ASSISTANCE. AIRPLANE TAXIED TO THE END OF RWY 24 AND TURNED R AT THE TXWY A3 INTXN CLRING THE RWY WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. UPON QUESTIONING THE STUDENT; I DETERMINED THAT THE PREVIOUS INSTRUCTORS HAD NOT EXPLAINED THE NOSEWHEEL STEERING SYS OR THE BRAKE SYS ADEQUATELY TO THIS STUDENT. SHE ALSO STATED THAT PREVIOUS INSTRUCTORS TOGETHER DID NOT TELL HER HOW TO DO THINGS AS MUCH AS HER ASSIGNED INSTRUCTOR EVEN IF THE FIRST 3 FLTS WERE PUT TOGETHER. I FEEL THE INADEQUATE EXPLANATION OF THE BRAKING AND NOSEWHEEL STEERING SYS WAS A MAJOR FACTOR. CONTRIBUTING TO THIS I BELIEVE WAS THE STUDENT'S EXPERIENCE WITH PREVIOUS INSTRUCTORS WHO HAD ALL MADE SURE THE AIRPLANE MADE THE MID FIELD A2 TXWY R TURNOFF. AS A FURTHER FACTOR; IT SEEMS THE STUDENT WAS NEEDING ADDITIONAL PRACTICE APPLYING L BRAKE; AS SHE WAS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO HAVING TO DO THIS IN EVERYDAY LIFE AND ALSO PROPER BRAKE APPLICATION TECHNIQUES. I ALSO FEEL THE IMPORTANCE OF BRAKING STRAIGHT AHEAD WHILE DECELERATING FROM A LNDG SHOULD BE STRESSED BEGINNING WITH THE FIRST FLT AND THAT A TURN ONTO A TXWY ONLY BE ATTEMPTED ONCE THE AIRPLANE HAS SLOWED DOWN TO A SAFE TAXI SPD. I BELIEVE THE ADDITION OF STRESSING BRAKING STRAIGHT AHEAD DURING AFTER LNDG DECELERATION TO NORMAL TAXI SPD SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE FAA'S AIRPLANE FLYING HANDBOOK INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT 'THE AIRPLANE SHOULD BE GRADUALLY SLOWED TO NORMAL TAXI SPD BEFORE TURNING' AS WELL AS ONLY TURNING OFF THE RWY AFTER THE AIRPLANE HAS ATTAINED A SAFE TAXI SPD FIRST.",,,,"C152 INSTRUCTOR AND STUDENT LNDG AT ARB HAVE RWY EXCURSION.",

I ANSWERED BY SAYING YES AND AFTER THAT MY RADIOS KEPT GOING IN AND OUT AND I COULDN'T HEAR ANYTHING ANYMORE. I KEPT CIRCLING THE ARPT LOOKING FOR LIGHT GUN SIGNALS BUT NOTHING HAPPENED.

HE HAS OWNED AND FLOWN THE AIRPLANE FOR YRS; BUT HAD NOT FLOWN MUCH IN THE PAST 2 YRS BECAUSE: 1) HE HAD GNDLOOPED IT HIMSELF; AND 2) AFTER IT CAME OUT FROM THE SHOP HIS INSTRUCTOR GNDLOOPED IT. HE CAME TO ME FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTION. HE SAID HE HAD NEVER FELT COMFORTABLE WITH WHEEL LNDGS. WE FLEW FOR MANY HRS GETTING HIM COMFORTABLE IN THE AIRPLANE AND ALSO TEACHING HIM WHEEL LNDGS. AFTER MANY FLTS HIS SKILLS WERE BETTER THAN THEY HAD BEEN WHEN HE STARTED; ALL HE WAS LACKING WAS CONFIDENCE. SO I CONTINUED TO FLY WITH HIM FOR MORAL SUPPORT AND TO KEEP BUILDING HIS CONFIDENCE. HIS SKILLS GOT TO THE POINT WHERE I WOULD SIMPLY REMIND HIM PERIODICALLY TO MAKE SURE HIS TOES WERE OFF THE BRAKES; OR TO KEEP LOOKING DOWN THE RWY. ON THE DAY OF THIS INCIDENT; HE HAD INVITED ME TO GO GET BREAKFAST WITH HIM AND A FRIEND. THERE WAS ABOUT A 7-8 KT XWIND COMPONENT FROM THE L. I SUGGESTED WE STAY IN THE PATTERN FOR A FEW TOUCH-AND-GOES BEFORE DEPARTING; BECAUSE HE HAD NOT FLOWN IN A FEW WKS. ON THE FIRST TKOF; I HAD TO REMIND HIM TO START WITH AILERONS FULL INTO THE WIND. OTHER THAN THAT; THE TKOF WAS TEXTBOOK. HE RAISED THE TAIL; KEPT IT STRAIGHT WHILE ROLLING ON THE MAINS; LIFTED THE R MAIN; THEN THE L MAIN; REMAINED IN GND EFFECT UNTIL REACHING VY; THEN CLBED OUT. THE LNDG WAS ALSO A TEXTBOOK WHEEL LNDG -- HE STABILIZED THE AIRPLANE IN A LEVEL ATTITUDE JUST INCHES OFF THE RWY; TOUCHED THE L MAIN; CAME FORWARD ON THE STICK; TOUCHED THE R MAIN; IDLED PWR; AND SLOWED. WITH THE XWIND HE WAS FOCUSING INTENTLY ON THE RUDDER WORK; AND AS HE SET THE TAIL DOWN HE WENT AILERONS NEUTRAL. AGAIN; I REMINDED HIM TO PUT AILERONS INTO THE WIND; AS WE ROLLED TO A STOP. HE KEPT AILERONS INTO THE WIND AS WE BEGAN OUR TKOF ROLL; BUT THIS TIME AS HE RAISED THE TAIL HE WENT NEUTRAL WITH THE AILERONS. AS THE TAIL CAME UP THE AIRPLANE BEGAN TO WEATHERVANE TO THE L; AND INSTEAD OF ADDING RUDDER HE WENT FULL AILERON TO THE R (AWAY FROM THE WIND!) OF COURSE THIS MADE THINGS MUCH WORSE. I SAID 'R RUDDER!' AND HE WAS ADDING IT BUT THEN HE PULLED PWR AND LET GO OF EVERYTHING WHILE THE NOSE WAS SWINGING BACK TO THE R. I SAID 'MY PLANE;' BUT UNFORTUNATELY; I HAD NOT BEEN ON THE CTLS; SO WHEN I TOOK IT; IT WAS ALREADY QUITE OUT OF CTL. I TRIED TO STOP THE SWERVING BUT WITH A 200+ LB PAX IN THE BACK SEAT IT HAD A LOT OF MOMENTUM. I BRIEFLY ADDED PWR TO HELP MAKE THE TAIL MORE EFFECTIVE. THIS HELPED; BUT WITH THE TAIL ON THE GND AND MOVING AT A SLOW SPD; I DECIDED IT WOULD BE SAFER TO BE SLOWING DOWN THAN SPEEDING UP. SO I IDLED PWR AND TRIED TO KEEP IT STRAIGHT BUT BY THIS TIME THE TURN HAD TIGHTENED UP AND WE GNDLOOPED TO THE L. ALTHOUGH WE NEVER LEFT THE RWY WE DID DRAG A WINGTIP AND THE HORIZ STABILIZER. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: XWIND. THE XWIND WAS ONLY 7 OR 8 KTS; BUT IT DID CONTRIBUTE TO THE INITIAL LOSS OF CTL; WHICH WAS A YAW INTO THE WIND WHEN HE LIFTED THE TAIL. BACKSEAT PAX: WHILE WELL WITHIN CTR OF GRAVITY; THE AFT CTR OF GRAVITY DID CONTRIBUTE. PRIMACY: UNFORTUNATELY; THE PLT'S INITIAL REACTION WHEN THE NOSE YAWED L WAS TO MOVE AILERONS R; INITIALLY WITH NO RUDDER INPUT. THIS HABIT OF 'DRIVING THE AIRPLANE LIKE A CAR' IS COMMON AMONG TRICYCLE GEAR PLTS. I WAS VERY SURPRISED TO SEE IT IN THIS PLT; WHO HAD LEARNED IN TRICYCLE GEAR BUT HAD FLOWN TAILWHEEL FOR AT LEAST THE PAST 100 HRS. COMPLACENCY: I HAD LANDED THIS AIRPLANE IN 20 KT DIRECT XWINDS; AND HAD SEEN THIS PLT DO LNDGS IN 10 KT AND 15 KT XWINDS IN THIS PLANE. HE HAD JUST LANDED IN THE 7-8 KT XWIND. I HAD BEEN ON SO MANY FLTS WITH HIM (DOING TOUCH-AND-GOES) THAT WERE UNEVENTFUL THAT I VERY MUCH TRUSTED HIS SKILLS. THEREFORE; WHEN I TRIED TO SAVE IT; THINGS HAD ALREADY GOTTEN FAR OUT OF CTL. LESSON LEARNED: AS AN INSTRUCTOR; YOU CAN NEVER BE 'ALONG FOR THE RIDE.' EVEN THOUGH THE PLT HAD ADMITTED SEVERAL FLTS AGO THAT HE COULD GO BY HIMSELF; HE JUST 'DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE GOING ALONE JUST YET.'

MAYBE THE STUDENT AND THE INSTRUCTOR BOTH MISREAD THE FUEL QUANTITY ON THE TANK. THE PROB HERE IS THAT THE STUDENT AND THE INSTRUCTOR DO NOT RELY ON THE FUEL GAUGES BECAUSE THE FUEL GAUGES OF THE C152 IN THAT FLYING SCHOOL USUALLY DO NOT WORK PROPERLY. FOR INSTANCE; IN THE GND THE GAUGES READ NORMALLY; BUT WHEN YOU START FLYING; THEY START INDICATING ERRATIC READINGS.

UPON ARRIVING (20 MI OUT) AT ZZZ3 APCH ASKED WHICH OF THE 2 APCHS I WANTED; VOR OR GPS. ACFT IS ONLY CERTIFIED FOR THE VOR AND THAT WAS THE APCH I ASKED FOR. WAS TOLD THE VOR WAS OTS. FSS NEVER GAVE ME THE NOTAM AND I DIDN'T ASK FOR NOTAMS FOR THIS FLT (MISTAKE #1). UPON ARRIVING 5 MI FROM ZZZ3 I ASKED FOR AND APCH GAVE THE CEILING AT ZZZ3. I HAD TRIED TO PICK UP THE ATIS THERE; BUT COULDN'T RECEIVE IT ON #2 COM. HAD THE VOR BEEN IN SVC IT (ATIS) WOULD HAVE TOLD ME THE CEILING WAS BELOW MINIMUMS. I THEN ASKED APCH FOR VECTORS TO THE NEAREST ILS. I WAS GIVEN VECTORS FOR THE ILS RWY 11 INTO ZZZ. APCH GOT ME WITHIN 6 MI S OF ZZZ1 AND THEN PUT ME ON AN EXTENDED DOWNWIND FOR THE ILS. (BREAK; I KNEW THEY HAD BEEN HOLDING AIRLINERS BECAUSE OF WX.) I KNEW I WAS GETTING LOW ON FUEL BUT DIDN'T TELL APCH (MISTAKE #2). WE DEPARTED ZZZ2 AT XA10Z. IT WAS HARD IMC FROM XA00Z UNTIL PRESENT TIME XB30Z. WHILE ENRTE AT 7000 FT I HAD MODERATE TURB AND ASKED FOR HIGHER BECAUSE I HAD A PAX ON BOARD AND WANTED SMOOTHER AIR. IT WAS SMOOTHER AT 9 FOR AWHILE. BACK TO PRESENT; I KNEW THE ZZZ CEILING WAS ABOVE MINIMUMS. XC40Z APCH FINALLY PUT ME ON BASE LEG FOR THE ILS. MY NEEDLE (VERT) WAS AWAKING UP WHEN THE ENG QUIT. ALT 3000 FT MSL IN A SMOOTH CLOUD LAYER. ACFT BEST GLIDE SPD 70 MPH. I IMMEDIATELY WENT TO 70 MPH AND DECLARED AN EMER. APCH SAID ARPT AT MY 11; 2 1/2 MI. I HEADED THAT WAY BUT WHEN I BROKE OUT 300 FT AGL I COULD ONLY SEE TREES. THERE WAS AN OPENING UP AHEAD BUT I COULDN'T CONFIRM THAT IT WAS THE ARPT. (THE TREES WERE TALL; 80 FT TO 100 FT HIGH.)

MY BIGGEST CONCERN WAS A SEMI AND THE CARS BEHIND ME PILING UP. BLEEDING OFF AIRSPD TO LAND IN CTR LANE I CAME CLOSE TO CAR AHEAD OF ME 30 FT? AND THEN HE STARTED PULLING AWAY FROM US.

THE PLANNED ROUTING WAS ZZZ; ZZZ1; ZZZ2; ZZZ; WHICH I HAD DONE PREVIOUSLY ON DUAL XCOUNTRY FLT WITH MY INSTRUCTOR. I SHOWED MY INSTRUCTOR MY FLT PLANS; FLT DOCUMENTS; WE DISCUSSED THE WX; RADIOS AND I WAS CLRED TO GO. IT JUST SO HAPPENED THAT MY INSTRUCTOR WAS SCHEDULED TO DO A DUAL XCOUNTRY WITH A STUDENT ON THE SAME RTE DEPARTING A FEW MINS BEHIND ME. I WAS VERY INVOLVED IN THINKING ABOUT MY FLT AND WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO AND I WAS NOT AWARE AND HONESTLY WOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THE FACT THAT I NEEDED A SPECIAL ENDORSEMENT IN MY LOGBOOK AND STUDENT CERTIFICATE. THE FLT WENT WELL ALL THE WAY TO ZZZ1. HOWEVER ON THE LNDG AT ZZZ1; I BOUNCED THE AIRPLANE ON LNDG. WHEN THE AIRPLANE CAME TO A STOP THE MOTOR HAD STOPPED. I EXITED THE AIRPLANE AND SAW THAT THE NOSEWHEEL WAS MISSING AND PROP WAS CURLED BACK. MY INSTRUCTOR LANDED SHORTLY AFTERWARDS AND HAD WITNESSED WHAT HAPPENED. MY INSTRUCTOR REALIZED THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO ENDORSE MY LOGBOOK AND ASKED ME FOR IT. I GAVE IT TO HIM AND A FEW MINS LATER HE BROUGHT IT BACK TO ME AND I PUT IT IN MY BAG WITHOUT LOOKING AT IT. SOMETIME LATER MR X; THE OWNER OF THE FLT SCHOOL; CAME TO THE TERMINAL; HE ASKED ME FOR MY LOGBOOK WHICH I HANDED TO HIM. MY STUDENT CERTIFICATE WAS IN A SMALL POUCH IN THE BACK OF THE LOGBOOK. JUST PRIOR TO DEP FROM ZZZ1 I ASKED MR X FOR MY LOGBOOK BUT HE SAID HE NEEDED IT FOR THE INVESTIGATION AND WOULD RETURN IT AFTER THE ENDORSEMENT EXPIRED. I RODE BACK TO ZZZ1 WITH MY INSTRUCTOR IN THE C150 HE WAS FLYING AND MY INSTRUCTOR'S STUDENT RODE BACK WITH MR X. AFTER ARRIVING ZZZ MR X ASKED ME TO TAKE A DRUG TEST; WHICH I DID. IN CLOSING; I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THE LACK OF AN ENDORSEMENT IN MY DOCUMENTS WHEN I LEFT ZZZ WAS AN HONEST OVERSIGHT. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 753821: A STUDENT PLT THAT I HAVE BEEN TRAINING WAS INVOLVED IN A BOUNCED LNDG THAT RESULTED IN A PROP-STRIKE AT ZZZ1. MY STUDENT WAS FLYING A C152. I WAS GIVING DUAL FLT INSTRUCTION TO ANOTHER STUDENT IN A C150 AND ARRIVED AT ZZZ1 SHORTLY AFTER MY SOLO STUDENT LANDED. THERE WERE NO PERSONAL INJURIES. MY STUDENT WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE TERMINAL BUILDING. AFTER ENSURING THAT BOTH FLT PLANS WERE CLOSED; I CALLED THE OWNER OF ACFT X TO ADVISE HIM OF THE INCIDENT. HE SAID HE WAS IMMEDIATELY LEAVING AND SHOULD ARRIVE IN ZZZ1 AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. I TOLD MY EMPLOYER; THE ACFT OWNER; THAT I HAD FORGOTTEN TO MAKE THE REQUIRED ENTRIES IN THE STUDENT'S LOGBOOK AND ON THE REVERSE OF THE MEDICAL FORM. A LITTLE MORE THAN AN HR AFTER THE INCIDENT; THE ARPT MGR TRANSPORTED ME TO THE TERMINAL. DURING THAT RIDE I VOLUNTARILY TOLD THE MGR THAT I HAD FORGOTTEN TO MAKE THE PROPER ENDORSEMENTS IN THE STUDENT'S LOGBOOK AND ON THE REVERSE OF THE STUDENT'S MEDICAL FORM. I REGRET THE ERROR OF NOT MAKING THE PROPER ENDORSEMENTS PRIOR TO THE FLT. THE LATER SIGNING OF THE LOGBOOK; WAS DONE WITHOUT FRAUDULENT INTENT ON THE DATE INDICATED; WHICH INFO WAS TRUE AND CORRECT.

THEREAFTER; I SECURED THE ACFT AND PARKED THE ACFT AT THE APRON. APPROX 45 MINS LATER; I CHKED THE FUEL LEVERS IN MY ACFT AND I GOT INTO MY ACFT WITH THE INTENTION OF TAXIING TO THE SELF FUEL PUMPS TO GET SOME AVGAS 100LL FUEL FOR MY ACFT. AFTER THE COMPLETION OF MY PREFLT CHK; IT ESCAPED MY MIND TO TAXI TO THE SELF REFUEL STATION. I TAXIED TO THE DEP END OF RWY 25R. (I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WAS THE MOMENT OF CRUCIAL ERROR AND FORGETFULNESS ON MY PART.) I TOOK OFF FROM THE ZZZ2 ARPT AND TOOK A R DOWNWIND DEP SO AS TO AVOID TERRAIN N OF THE AIRFIELD.

AFTER ACKNOWLEDGING THE CALL; I CHANGED FREQ TO THE AWOS FREQ AT THE ZZZ2 ARPT TO OBTAIN THE CURRENT WINDS. I PROCEEDED TO CHANGE THE FREQ TO THE ZZZ2 CTAF TO ADVISE ANY POSSIBLE TFC OF MY WHEREABOUTS AND TO ANNOUNCE MY INTENTIONS TO LAND. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THIS CALL; MY ENG STOPPED AND I BEGAN TO TRIM THE ACFT SO AS TO OBTAIN AN AIRSPD THAT WOULD GIVE ME MAX GLIDING DISTANCE. I TURNED L OF MY PRESENT POS TO GO BACK TO MIL ARPT AS THIS WAS THE ARPT CLOSEST TO ME WHERE I DETERMINED I COULD LAND SAFELY WITHOUT HARM TO LIFE OR PROPERTY. IMMEDIATELY AFTER FOLLOWING RECOMMENDED PROCS FOR THE EMER; I CONTACTED MIL APCH CTL ON THE FREQ 119.9 AND INFORMED THEM ABOUT MY SITUATION AND DECLARED AN EMER. APCH CTL ADVISED ME TO CONTACT TWR. ON SWITCHING TO TWR FREQ; I WAS ADVISED TO LAND ON RWY 21R. I ACKNOWLEDGED. AFTER REVIEWING THE READINGS OF MY ALTIMETER; I ADVISED TWR THAT I MAY BE UNABLE TO GLIDE TO RWY 21R AND REQUESTED FOR PERMISSION TO LAND ON RWY 21L. AFTER MIL TWR CLRED ME TO LAND ON RWY 21L; I MADE A SAFE LNDG ON RWY 21L. I WAS GIVEN PERMISSION TO TAXI ACROSS THE RWY 21R AND HOLD POS AFTER WHICH EMER VEHICLES WOULD ESCORT ME. AFTER BEING DETAINED FOR SECURITY PURPOSES; I WAS ESCORTED TO THE ZZZ2 ARPT BY AN OFFICER TO TRY AND OBTAIN SOME 100LL AVIATION FUEL AS THE MIL ARPT DID NOT CARRY THAT GRADE OF FUEL. I PURCHASED A 5 GALLON GAS CAN WHICH I FILLED UP TO THE BRIM; WITH 100LL AT ZZZ2. THE OFFICER THEN TOOK ME BACK TO THE ACFT WHERE I WAS ALLOWED TO DISPENSE FUEL INTO THE ACFT. THEREAFTER; I WAS ESCORTED TO THE BASE MGR OFFICE WHERE I HAD TO FILL UP SOME FORMS. I WAS ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE BASE UPON COMPLETION OF THE FORMALITIES AND TAKE OFF.

I CALCULATE THAT IF THE PLANE TAKES 26 GALLONS; IT SHOULD HAVE HAD 9.5 GALLONS IN EACH WING. I THEN CALCULATED THAT IF I WAS GOING TO BE FLYING FOR 2 HRS THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN ME 12 GALLONS PLUS 1 GALLON OF THE GND OPS. SO 13 GALLONS PLUS 2.5 GALLONS OF UNUSABLE FUEL -- THAT'S 15.5 GALLONS OUT OF 19 GALLONS. I THOUGHT THE PLANE HAD ANOTHER 3.5 GALLONS OF USABLE FUEL. I CHKED THE FUEL LEVELS IN ALL PHASES OF FLT; AND AT THE END OF THE FLT THE NEEDLES WERE POINTING A LITTLE LESS THAN 1/4 IN EACH TANK -- JUST BEFORE I SHUT THE PLANE DOWN.

IT TOOK THE STUDENT LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO GET FUEL AND FINISH FLT PLANNING. I RETURNED TO THE PLANE AND ASKED IF HE WAS READY TO GO; AND HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS.

I'M SURE THE OUTCOME OF THIS ACTION IS ALREADY CLR. WE DEPARTED ZZZ1 AT APPROX XA10; SBOUND TO ZZZ.

IF YOU ADD THE 12 MINS AS SPECIFIED IN THE POH FOR OUR CLB AND 10 MINS FOR TAXI AND RUN-UP; THAT WOULD HAVE TECHNICALLY MEANT THAT WITH OUR 24.5 GALLONS OF USABLE FUEL WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FLY FOR 4 HRS 11 MINS.

DURING THE LAST PORTION OF OUR FLT NEARLY 10 NM FROM OUR DEST AT EXACTLY 3 HRS 30 MINS INTO THE FLT; I NOTICED THAT THE RPM SUDDENLY DROPPED FROM 2400 FPM TO 2200 RPM.

I EXECUTED A CLBING TURN AND RPTED TO THE APCH MY CURRENT ALT (I RECALL SOMETHING MORE THAN 1000 FT BUT NOT QUITE SURE NOW) CLBING 3000 FT; HDG 350 DEGS. I WAS CONFUSED ABOUT THE 350 DEG HDG AND THE HDG SW OF MY FLT DIRECTION TO ZZZ2; SO I HALTED AT 150 DEG HDG BUT CONTINUE TO CLB. WHEN THE APCH ASKED WHAT HDG I HOLD; I REPLIED 150 DEGS. I WAS REPRIMANDED TO KEEP RWY HDG; WHICH I IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED. I COMPLIED TO THE ATC INSTRUCTION TO CLB TO 4000 FT; WHICH WAS THE ALT I FILED FOR; BUT DECLINED THE INSTRUCTIONS OF CLBING TO 5000 FT A FEW TIMES BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID OF GETTING INTO ICING CONDITIONS DUE TO THE FREEZING LEVEL OF 5000 FT I GOT FROM THE WX BRIEFING AND THE VISIBLE MOISTURE (IT WAS RAINING AT THE TIME). THE ATC CTLR GAVE ME 2 CHOICES OF VECTORING AND GPS APCH FOLLOWING THE OLM VOR. I CHOSE THE SECOND CHOICE BECAUSE THE PLANE HAS THE GPS DEVICE (WHICH I WAS MISTAKENLY FILED AS /A INSTEAD OF /G) AND I HAD SET IT UP FOR A GPS APCH TO RWY 16 AT ZZZ2. HOWEVER; I WAS CONFUSED ON THE SECOND PART OF THE CLRNC TO FOLLOW THE OLM VOR; WHICH I DIDN'T HAVE THE FREQ FOR. I WAS VERY BUSY LOOKING UP THE FREQ FOR THE OLM VOR ON THE IFR LOW LEVEL CHART AND FINDING A WAY TO SET IT UP ON THE GPS THAT WAS ALREADY BEEN SET FOR THE APCH IN THE ACTUAL IMC WITH CLOUDS OF MULTIPLE SHADES AROUND ME; I GOT INTO ADVERSE CONDITIONS AND I WAS IN SOME SORT OF A DIVE. I NOTICED THE ATTITUDE WENT HAYWIRE; THE ENG SOUNDED LOUDER; AND THE AIRSPD INDICATOR WENT TO THE YELLOW ARC. I DROPPED EVERYTHING AND TRIED TO CURE THE SITUATION; I FORGOT TO RESPOND TO THE ATC CALLS. I DO NOT RECALL HOW MANY TIMES; BUT I KNOW THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN MORE THAN ONCE BECAUSE I GOT INTO THAT ADVERSE SITUATION AT LEAST TWICE. IN ADDITION; ADDED TO ALL THOSE CONFUSION; I NOTICED THAT THE GPS SCREEN WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AND I COULD NOT FIND A WAY TO KNOW WHERE I WAS ON THE SCREEN. AT THE END; THE ATC CTLR OFFERED TO DIVERT ME TO ANOTHER ARPT; ZZZ3; WHERE I COULD LAND VISUALLY. THE APCH ADVISED ME TO CALL HIM THROUGH THE ZZZ3 CTLR; WHICH I DID. I WAS ADVISED THAT FSDO WILL GIVE ME A CALL LATER ON. AFTER REFUELING THE PLANE; I DECIDED TO RETURN TO THE ACFT BASE AT ZZZ AND TERMINATED THE FLT. I FILED FOR AN IFR SHORT FLT WITH AN ILS RWY 13R APCH FROM ZZZ3 TO ZZZ BECAUSE OF THE IMC WAS STILL IN EFFECT AND THE BASE OF CLOUDS WAS ONLY ABOUT LESS THAN 1000 FT; AND BECAUSE I COULD NOT STAY IN THE PLANE WITH MY WRECKING NERVE AFTER THE CALL. I HAD WANTED TO GO HOME VERY BADLY. I EXECUTED THE FLT ALRIGHT UNTIL THE ATC CTLR GAVE ME THE L-TURN FINAL CUT TO JOIN THE LOC 13. I DID TURN L BUT WHEN I HEARD THE ATC CTLR REPEATED THE CLRNC 'L-TURN TO 15 JOIN THE LOC; I THOUGHT I TURNED IN A WRONG DIRECTION; SO REVERSED THE DIRECTION OF MY TURN TO THE R AND REPEATED 'L-TURN TO 15 TO JOIN.' I SPECULATE; NOW; THAT THE SECOND CALL WAS BECAUSE I DID NOT REPEAT THE 'L-TURN' INSTRUCTION; NOT BECAUSE I DID IT WRONG THE FIRST TIME. AFTER 40 OR 50 DEGS INTO THE TURN; THE ATC CTLR CALLED TO TELL ME MY MISTAKE OF EXECUTING THE R-TURN INSTEAD OF THE INSTRUCTED (AND REPEATED) L-TURN. AT THE TIME; MY WORKLOAD WAS TO THE MAX DUE TO MY INABILITY TO CHANGE THE GPS DEVICE TO CONNECT TO THE GS AND LOC INST (I DID MENTION TO THE ATC CTLR DURING THIS TIME THAT I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO USE THE ILS APCH AND ASKED FOR LOC APCH INSTEAD; BUT I WAS DECLINED DUE TOTHE HVY IMC WX AT THE TIME). I FOUND OUT AND USED THE BACK-UP INST FOR THE APCH AND CONFIRM WITH THE ATC THAT I WOULD CONTINUE WITH THE ILS APCH. I FEEL THAT THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT CAN HELP WITH THIS INCIDENCE. FIRST; I NEED TO BE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE GPS DEVICE ON BOARD AND SHOULD HAVE SET ALL THE DEVICES UP INSTEAD OF RELYING ON ONE INST (IT WOULD HELP IF I ASKED FOR THE VOR FREQ INSTEAD OF LOOKING IT UP MYSELF). SECONDLY; I FEEL THAT IT WOULD HELP ME TREMENDOUSLY IF THE CLRNC WERE NOT SO WORDY. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE ATC CTLR WANTED TO BE HELPFUL AND TRIED TO POINT OUT ALL THE STEPS; THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH INFO A PERSON CAN DIGEST AND TRULY REGISTER -- ESPECIALLY WHEN THE WX PLAYS A ROLE. I WISH I COULD HAVE SOME CLRNCS WITH FEWER WORDS AND WAS DELIVERED IN A SLOWER SPD. THIRDLY; IF THE ATC CTLRS CAN KEEP THEIR COOL; IT WOULD HELP A LOT. IN THE IMC; PLTS WOULD ALREADY FEEL SCARED. I WOULD! I ACTUALLY FEEL SCARED OF THE ATC CTLRS MORE THAN THE WX; ALTHOUGH I KNOW THAT I NEED THEIR HELP.",,,,"LOW TIME PRIVATE PLT WITH INSTRUMENT RATING RELATES A HARROWING TALE OF THEIR FIRST ACTUAL IMC FLT.",

MY CONCERN: PLT (INSTRUCTOR?) IN ACFT Y PERFORMED HIS/HER MANEUVERS WITH ABSOLUTELY NO REGARD TO ANY OF SEVERAL OTHER ACFT IN GAI TFC PATTERN; IN VMC. THE MANEUVER WAS POORLY PERFORMED BUT; FAR MORE IMPORTANT; WAS DANGEROUSLY PERFORMED WITH NO CONSIDERATION FOR POTENTIAL CONFLICTS WITH OTHER ACFT OPERATING IN VICINITY OF GAI.

I FIGURED THEY WERE SENDING ME 9 DEGS OFF BECAUSE THEY WERE DIVERTING ME FROM TFC. YET THEY NEVER RE-CORRECTED MY HDG; AND THAT IS WHEN I THINK I STARTED TO GET LOST. I HAD BEEN CRUISING FOR ABOUT 20 MINS NOW; AND I BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT I COULDN'T FIND OR RECOGNIZE ANY OF MY DISTANT CHKPOINTS. I TRIED XCHKING WITH VOR'S AND CONTACTING ZZZ1 AND ZZZ2.

THIS WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT ON THE FIRST AND SECOND LEGS THE HDG INDICATOR HAD BARELY PRECESSED AT ALL. I THEN CHANGED MY HDG AND GOT BACK TO ZZZ2 WITH THE MAGNETIC COMPASS ONLY. I COULDN'T GO ALL THE WAY BACK HOME BECAUSE OF A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST; I WAS CLOSE TO EXCEEDING THE LIMIT OF 1 HR OF FUEL LEFT DAY OR NIGHT ACCORDING TO THE SOP'S AT THE FLT SCHOOL. I LANDED AT ZZZ2 WITH 8.5 GALLONS OF FUEL LEFT. SECONDLY; I DIDN'T HAVE A NIGHT SOLO ENDORSEMENT; AND IT WAS A FEW MINS BEFORE IT WAS ACTUALLY CONSIDERED NIGHTTIME WHEN I LANDED AT ZZZ2. AFTER LNDG; I TAXIED OVER TO THE FBO AND WAITED FOR MY FLT INSTRUCTOR TO PICK ME UP AND TAKE ME BACK HOME. THERE WERE A FEW PROBS I HAD ENCOUNTERED AT ZZZ; AND I BELIEVE THEY ADDED NO HELP TO THE SITUATION TO BEGIN WITH. AFTER I LANDED AT ZZZ (MY DEST ON THE SECOND LEG OF MY XCOUNTRY) AND GOTTEN FUEL; I CONTACTED TWR LIKE THEY HAD REQUESTED AFTER I HAD GOTTEN THERE. TWR TOLD ME TO TAXI TO RWY 7 BY B-9 AND THEY ALSO TOLD ME TO CONTACT DEP. I THOUGHT THAT TO BE WEIRD SINCE TWR HAS TO GIVE THE CLRNC TO TKOF/LAND NOT DEP. YET; AS SOON AS I CONTACTED DEP; THEY GOT IRRITATED AND TOLD ME TO BACK TO TWR. THEY OBVIOUSLY HAD COM PROBS; AND IT WAS ALL VERY CONFUSING. ALSO; MY PUSH-TO-TALK BUTTON BARELY WORKED ON MY YOKE. I HAD TO CLICK IT 5 OR 6 TIMES JUST TO GIVE AN UNDERSTANDABLE RESPONSE TO THE TL TWR. THESE THINGS I BELIEVE DIDN'T HELP THE SITUATION AT ALL. OVERALL; I FEEL I COULD'VE DONE A FEW THINGS BETTER TO HELP PREVENT ME FROM GETTING LOST. IN THE FIRST PLACE; I SHOULD'VE CHKED THE HDG INDICATOR EVERY 15 MINS FOR PRECESSION LIKE I HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO. INSTEAD; I RELIED ON THE FACT THAT THE FIRST 2 LEGS IT HAD BARELY PRECESSED AT ALL; WHICH WASN'T A VERY SMART THING TO DO. ALSO; WHEN I HAD GOTTEN LOST; I COULD'VE CONTACTED FLT WATCH; OR CLBED HIGHER TO BETTER GET MY BEARINGS. I DID DO A FEW THINGS RIGHT THOUGH. I WAS AWARE OF THE FACT THAT I DIDN'T HAVE A SOLO NIGHT ENDORSEMENT SO I MADE SURE THAT I WOULDN'T BREAK A REG BY GETTING ON THE GND BEFORE IT TURNED TO NIGHTTIME. I ALSO XCHKED WITH VOR'S AND TRIED CONTACTING CTLED ARPTS. THESE WERE GOOD LOST PROCS THAT I FOLLOWED TO HELP ME FIND WHERE I WAS. GETTING LOST WAS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE; AND I HOPE TO NEVER MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES AGAIN THAT I MADE ON MY LAST FLT.",,,,"FAILURE TO MONITOR PRECESSION ON HER DG LEADS STUDENT PLT OF C152 ASTRAY.",

The reason the pilot tried to turn off on Alpha 7 was to quickly clear the runway for the jet traffic that had been cleared to position and hold behind him at Alpha 9 just after his touchdown. Afterward; the pilot realized that he should have kept the aircraft on centerline while braking to a speed that is safe for the aircraft to turn as desired.

As swerve steepened; the aircraft tilted to the left and the left wing tip scraped the runway.

I was able to taxi back onto the runway and via taxiway to the ramp. A visual inspection of the aircraft revealed scrape marks on the underside of the left wing tip and wrinkles on the top and bottom trailing surfaces of the left wing. The navigation and strobe lights on the left wing tip were undamaged and the leading edge appeared unmarked and straight. The yoke control of the left aileron appeared smooth and unaffected. There were no injuries and no apparent substantial damage to the aircraft. A possible cause of the initial swerve might have been a gust from the left-quartering tailwind. If so; the swerve might have been avoided by asking for and receiving permission from ATC for a landing on Runway 27; which would have resulted in a quartering headwind; which would have been easier to control for in a tailwheel airplane such as the Cessna 170-B.

Departed Florida; and refueled in GA. Diverted east-northeast toward Roanoke; VA; due to slow moving storm system across direct route to my destination. About 40 miles west of Roanoke; I was able to turn NNW; toward southeastern Ohio. We had been getting beat up pretty good with turbulence; and I climbed above a scattered layer into smooth air; climbing to 6500 MSL.  The layer gradually increased in altitude; and I climbed to 8500 MSL to maintain VFR cloud clearances.  Everything was still fine at this point; but I was about to make a very poor decision. The cloud layer gradually increased to a continuous layer.  The cloud layer was expected; but I expected to be well past the cloud layer before having to descend in mid-Ohio for fuel; and I stayed above the layer rather than backtracking and descending below the layer.  This was a poor decision.  The wind gradually increased to about 40 KTS headwind.  It gradually became clear to me that I did not have adequate fuel to get past the layer.  The cloud layer did indeed turn out to disappear approximately where I expected it to; but I could not get there with the fuel on board. I was way too far into the corner I created; by the time I admitted to it to myself.  At this point; I did not believe backtracking was a reasonable option.  The storm system; which I had done; an end-run around was slowly moving toward the route I had flown; the terrain behind me was higher; and the ceiling under the cloud layer was minimal. AWOS stations ahead of me were reporting ceiling of greater than 6000 FT; some of them reporting broken layer.  I was still hoping that I would find a break in the cloud layer; and be able to stay legal VFR. I finally realized that I had to choose between two poor options: 1. High probability of running out of fuel in flight if I continued trying to fly past the cloud layer. 2. Descend through the cloud layer; even though I am only VFR rated. I chose to descend through the cloud layer. I set up a heading toward a nearby airport reporting high ceiling; stabilized descent; and descended on instruments. The layer was not very thick; but I did not maintain VFR cloud clearance requirements.  Center would have known where and at what altitude I was; from my transponder.  Hopefully there was no other airplane cruising in that layer. My altimeter and transponder do have a recent IFR certification. After breaking out; I landed; and refueled.  Remaining fuel was minimal.  I then continued on to my destination in Indiana.  Within about 30 miles; the ceiling was unlimited. This is only about the third time that I have ever proceeded on top of an undercast. I did not plan to do it.  I did not have adequate and recent enough weather information to commit to that course of action; particularly with the fuel on board. I have been kicking around the idea of getting my instrument and commercial ratings; thinking that it would be an interesting thing to learn; even though I have no desire to actually do instrument flying on a regular basis.  This event has pushed me further in that direction. The jam I got myself into was my responsibility; caused by my poor decisions and not leaving a legal and safe way out. Fortunately; the minimal instrument time that I get every two years during biennial flight review allowed me to keep the airplane under control.",,,,"VFR C170 pilot descended through a cloud layer without clearance after strong head winds increase fuel consumption.",

If I had been thinking ahead; I would have climbed to 6000 FT MSL; having learned from experience that this is where SLC ATC was most likely to put me. Another pilot; following the same freeway west; was at approximately the same altitude. My plane flew right under his; missing by only 50-100 FT. Neither of us took evasive action. I did not see him the very last moment; due in part to the fact that I was distracted; recording SLC ATIS on my kneeboard. The other aircraft probably never saw me; since I was under this nose. Thankfully; the altimeter in my plane reads a little high; or we might have been at exactly the same altitude. Because westbound aircraft exiting the SLC I-80 Transition are hesitant to cross over the lake; much of the East-West traffic is confined to the area over the freeway. This may be caused by a tendency to avoid the lateral boundaries of SLC airspace; insufficient altitude to cross the lake safely; or simply because it's convenient to follow the freeway. Pilots inbound from; say Wendover (ENV); are often directed to descend and begin following I-80; and other simply do that on their own; to avoid the airspace. As a result; the route from the northern extents of the two mountains that surround the Tooele Valley is also congested. I don't see this as a huge problem that necessarily requires a solution; but thought I'd share a heads up. The near miss did; however; motivate me to illuminate another problem that is somewhat related; and perhaps a bit more serious. The Tooele Valley (area around TVY) is a popular practice area for many flight schools; especially for schools based in SLC. When SLC ATC directs VFR traffic into the valley; they usually order pilots to follow the I-80 Transition west at 5500 FT MSL. Similarly; most VFR pilots entering the SLC airspace from the Tooele valley are instructed to follow the I-80 east at 6000 FT MSL. This creates a narrow 'funnel area' a few miles aouthwest of the Garfield Stack; bound by mountains on one side; the Class B airspace on the other; where the potential for collision is high. Last year; while flying with my CFI; I experienced two near misses at the funnel area. On both occasions; my CFI took evasive action while uttering profanities. I'll bet if you ask other instructors about this funnel area; they too will have several tales of near misses. I believe its just a matter of time before a collision occurs here; between Eastbound and Westbound aircraft that are just entering or leaving the I-80 transition. After a typical pilot enters Tooele Valley at 5500 FT MSL; just west of the Garfield Stack; he makes a beeline to TVY for pattern work.  He will remain at the field for a while; do some touch-and-goes; and then when he is finished; fly straight back towards the Garfield Stack. This creates a condition where many aircraft are flying reciprocal; head-on courses; while in a climbing attitude. Combine this pattern with the funnel effect described above; and you have significant risk of collision. The risk is magnified by the fact that; during transition between the Garfield Stack and TVY; the pilot's workload is high. Pilots entering the valley from SLC first listen to TVY AWOS; and are not usually tuned to the CTAF yet. On the flip side; pilots exiting the valley for SLC are distracted; staining to hear SLC ATIS; which is often unintelligible before the aircraft reaches the lake (due to signal obstruction from the Oauirrh Mountains). Futhermore; the returning pilot might also be recording ATIS on his kneeboard. While all this is going on; everyone is in a nose-high attitude; heading right for each other; and crossing through each other's altitudes. Again; I think it's just a matter of time before something goes horribly wrong here. I don't know what the right answer is; but if arrangements can bemade to ensure that aircraft following these two well traveled routes; on reciprocal heading; aren't transitioning each other's altitudes unless they are under ATC control; that would probably solve the problem. One option might involve extending; to the west; The east-west portion of the I-80 transition for outbound traffic; and using the northeast-southwest leg only for inbound traffic. One might also consider dropping the floor of the Bravo airspace around the funnel area and maintaining radar coverage in that area.",,,,"C152 pilot reports NMAC with opposite direction C172 west of SLC at 5500 FT.",

I was past the road at the end of the runway when I heard a bang and knew the left wheel had hit a tall marker on the south side of the road.  The marker is approximately 20 feet high.  I asked my student to see if the wheel was all right and he said it looked fine to him.  I called back to the airport and asked them to look at the wheel when I made a low pass; which they did and said it looked O.K.  I then went around and came back in and landed the airplane.  I taxied the airplane to the maintenance hangar where I got out of the airplane and looked at the aircraft.  The left wheel seemed fine but on further inspection I noticed a dent in the right leading edge of the horizontal stabilizer.  It was the size of a quarter or 50 cent piece and approximately 1/4' deep.  The mechanic banged both hands against the area and the dent popped out some.  No other damage was seen other than normal for a rental airplane.",,,,"An extended float on an attempted landing at a short runway caused the instructor to assume control from the student and make a go-around.

I had already checked my weather and I had already figured my flight plan and had it filed with FSS. During my preflight I visually checked my fuel and couldn't tell if they were full or not; so I checked it with my fuel gauges that read both tanks were full. Relying on the fuel gauges that they were correct I departed. Upon reaching my turn around point I noticed that my left tank was reading empty; but my right tank read completely full. So I continued my flight back. About six miles out from a neighboring airport I started experiencing engine roughness. I notified Center of the engine roughness and directed my flight towards that diversion airport. When trying to figure out the problem of my engine roughness I checked my fuel gauges and my left tank read low and my right tank read half full. Still thinking that fuel wasn't the problem I proceeded to continue to figure out the problem. Finding no solutions to the problem I continued my course and around 500 FT above the diversion runway; I lost my engine power; but was still able to make a smooth landing. When I was safely landed on the ground I checked my fuel gauges and they  were still reading low on the left and half full on the right; but when I got out to visually check my fuel tanks they were extremely low.

The airport has two tower frequencies; with one of these serving as the CTAF after hours. Although we had looked up this information before the flight and had written the frequency on the navigation log. I used the sectional chart to get the frequency as we approached the airport. Unfortunately; I misread the chart and chose the wrong frequency; although we would not realize this until later. Also; as we approached the airport; and before our flight following was terminated; the Controller pointed out a C17 flying toward the airport from the south (we were approaching from the west). We remained west of the airport; did a left 360 to stay out of the way; and announced our position and intentions. As we rolled out of the turn the other aircraft was out of sight. Two runways were lit and we chose the smaller and closer Runway 18. Runway 18 is situated on the west edge of the airport and has a right traffic pattern; which would keep us out of the way in case the other aircraft was approaching to land. We announced our position on each leg of the pattern and landed on Runway 18 without seeing the other aircraft. We thought the other aircraft may have been passing through and had departed the area (perhaps flying to and from the VOR). After that we made some stop and go landings on the other lit Runway 4/22; always announcing our positions on each leg of the pattern. We never did see another aircraft; but on the last circuit in the pattern we did see a ground vehicle on the taxiway near the runway. We received a couple of bursts of static on the radio; which we thought might be that vehicle transmitting. We watched it and it remained stationary. We landed and the vehicle remained stationary. We announced our intentions to takeoff and the vehicle remained stationary. We initiated the takeoff and as the plane was about to liftoff; the vehicle pulled onto the runway and turned toward us; about 1500 FT ahead. I couldn't tell if the vehicle was moving toward us or was stopped; so I wasn't sure if we could stop in time. Since the plane was lifting off; I elected to climb and offset to the right. As we climbed out well above the vehicle; the student looked down and reported that the vehicle appeared to be a pickup and was stopped. We departed the area and again received flight following. We overheard a C17 complaining about a Cessna that took off ahead of them; forced them to abort a takeoff; and 'wasn't talking to anybody.' Evidently; they were on the larger; unlit runway that intersected the runway we were using. Later on as we tried to figure out what went wrong we discovered my error in selecting the CTAF frequency. I don't know how we missed seeing the other aircraft; perhaps the wing blocked our view; or more likely; we were too fixated on the vehicle.

My home airport is a Class D airport just under the shelf of the Class C airspace.  About five minutes previous I was in contact with the Class C Approach Controller and was cleared to proceed to my home airport.  The lights from my home airport blend in all too well with the surrounding city lights and so I was flying toward what I thought was the airport.  As the airliner approached toward me I had to quickly descend to around 900 FT MSL to avoid the plane as it passed over head at around 300 FT above my position.  Normally airliners on approach in the shelf area stay above 1;700 FT MSL.  After the plane passed overhead I noticed my position relative to a prominent landmark visible at night and realized I was quite a bit more west of my home airport than I thought.  The altitude of this plane and the landmark led me to believe I had flown into the Class C surface area by mistake.  I of course quickly adjusted my course to fly to my airport and to get my self out of the Class C surface area.  This flight occurred late enough at night that my home airport's Tower was closed for the night.  What I learned from this is to use better situational awareness of my position at night.

Preflight and engine startup were normal.  No brake fluid leaks were detected upon external inspection; but the outboard brake pads on both sides were noted to be close to end of normal life.  We both; the student (left seat) and I (right seat); tested the brakes before calling Ground for taxi instructions.  We were cleared to taxi from the North ramp to Runway 6 via Bravo then Alpha.  The taxi proceeded normally with the student learning rudder steering while I followed closely on the controls.  We stopped short of the holdshort line at Runway 6 while in a slight left turn.  While holding short of Runway 6 at Alpha; we ran the Before Takeoff Checklist.  On this lesson; I let the student run the entire checklist with myself clarifying and explaining as necessary.  The Before Takeoff Checklist was completed normally; but the time period took longer than usual since the student was working the checklist and this was only his 2nd lesson.  We then called Tower and were cleared for takeoff Runway 6 with a left turnout for a North departure.  As we began rolling to taxi from the holdshort line to the runway; the student had difficulty straightening the aircraft toward the runway as the aircraft stayed in a left turn.  I immediately took control of the aircraft.  I attempted full right rudder pedal and right brake.  The rudder attempted to respond; but the right toe brake went horizontal from lack of brake pressure.  The aircraft continued to turn left as rudder pressure alone was insufficient to turn right and straighten the aircraft.  I now reduced the throttle to idle and attempted full brake on both sides to stop the aircraft from rolling.  This had the effect of tightening the left turn.  The nosewheel of the aircraft rolled off the taxiway.  With the aircraft now slopping slightly downhill (because the nosewheel was off the taxiway); I had difficulty bringing the aircraft to a stop.  I pulled the mixture to kill the engine.  The aircraft came to rest with the nosewheel off the taxiway; still short of the holdshort line to Runway 6.  As the aircraft was sitting stopped; I pumped both brakes several times and could feel brake pressure return somewhat to the right brake pedal.  From my seat I could see the right brake pads move when right brake pressure was then applied and released. Upon external inspection; the brakes appeared normal with no hydraulic leaks.  There was no damage the aircraft or the airport.  There were no injuries.  I speculate that there is a hydraulic leak within the right brake cylinder; and the extended period of holding the brakes caused fluid to gradually move behind the cylinder head.  This would cause a loss of hydraulic brake pressure and the resulting brake failure.",,,,"C152 instructor reports right brake failure while the student was attempting to taxi the aircraft.

To accomplish this; we had conducted three passes down Runway 12R/30L; turning 180 degrees at the ends; with Tower clearance.  I had informed Tower that we may become momentarily airborne. After the third pass; we repositioned to Runway 30R as instructed; for a final fast-taxi pass; our intent was to then depart Runway 12L in left closed traffic for pattern work.  I transferred control to my student; and asked that the she repeat the maneuver.   She used sufficient power to become airborne; and I noted that she did not immediately retard the throttle; and we were climbing slowly.  I took control at a moment when I could not see the 12L end of the runway.  By the time I yawed the aircraft to give me sufficient visibility; I determined that continuing in a normal climb would be safer than attempting to land on the remaining runway.  As we climbed out; Tower commented 'That was not the fast taxi we expected.'  I apologized and stated that I did not believe we could have stopped safely in the runway remaining.  I noted Tower instructing another aircraft to hold position; and attempted unsuccessfully to observe his position on the ground.  Upon landing; Ground Control informed me of a possible pilot deviation and asked me to call the Tower.  When I called; Tower explained that the other aircraft had already been issued a takeoff clearance.  I do not know whether that aircraft had already begun moving; but it was clearly a potentially dangerous situation.  Lessons for me include noting how quickly a student can convert a fast-taxi into a fully-developed takeoff and climb; and to be ready to assume control more quickly in that situation.  Further; I believe that it would be better to request a takeoff clearance from Tower; and notify them that we may simply fast-taxi the length of the runway and exit at the far end; to cover the possibility of the fast-taxi becoming a departure.",,,,"Flight Instructor reports his student became inadvertently airborne while doing fast taxi maneuvers to illustrate the landing attitude.

When I arrived at the plane my student was walking around the tail performing his preflight inspection; and I supervised his actions. When he completed the visual inspection of the fuel tanks I too inspected the fuel level; and we both confirmed that the fuel level appeared to be half capacity in each tank. No issues were found during the preflight; and no water was found in any sump or the fuel strainer. We started the aircraft; performed a radio check; and taxied out. No issues were found during our completion of the before takeoff checklist. We departed the runway. We then completed two full stop landings. The third landing was preceded by a stabilized approach just like the ones before. Upon touchdown I raised the flaps; and told the student to turn the carb heat off; and apply full power for one more landing. Upon reaching approximately 35 to 45 FT AGL the RPMs decreased substantially; and we began to lose airspeed. At this point there was approximately 500 to 600 FT of runway remaining. I took over the controls; and applied carb heat while also changing the throttle setting to see if this issue could be improved. I also initiated a slight right hand turn to try to stay away from the electrical wires beyond the departure end of the runway. I had only turned approximately 10 to 20 degrees to the right before the engine coughed a couple of times and then quit entirely. I then turned left and planned to put the aircraft down as close to the road as possible in case we needed medical attention. I reduced the throttle to idle; and glided towards my desired touchdown point. I held the aircraft just above the soybeans as long as possible as to dissipate as much speed as possible. The mains settled into the soybeans and I held full backpressure to try to keep the nosewheel from digging into the soil. The aircraft slowed to a walking pace as we approached a drainage ditch on the side of the road; and the aircraft rolled down into the ditch at a very slow speed and settled against the side of the ditch closest to the road. I confirmed with my student that he was unharmed; and we shut off the fuel valve; pulled the mixture to Idle Cutoff; turned off the magnetos and the master switch; and then evacuated the aircraft. Problem: Not enough fuel sufficient for the flight. Cause: Visual inspection of the fuel was inadequate; and a fuel pipette should have been used to determine EXACT amount of fuel on board. Corrective actions: I will never fly a plane unless it is safe and there is more than enough fuel available for the planned flight PLUS extra. Now I will not fly unless it is either topped off; or there is an approved stick to determine EXACTLY how much fuel is in each tank.",,,,"A C152 instructor pilot and student experienced fuel exhaustion and made a forced landing in a field.",

We received flight following from Razorback departure. After contacting departure we were told to contact Razorback approach. I read back the command and returned to Razorback approach. I made multiple calls; more than 8; and heard no responses. When we were about 7 miles outside of FSM with the field in sight I tried to contact Fort Smith tower. I made several calls to the tower with no response. I turned back to Razorback Approach and tried two more times. I then turned to the FSM ATIS and heard nothing. At this point I was 3-4 miles out and I Squawked 7600 in the transponder. I entered the field at a 45 degree angle and flew a right upwind for Runway 25; all the while I was making radio calls as if the Tower could hear me. I continuously scanned the pattern for traffic and saw a high wing Cessna departing Runway 25 and climbing out which was no factor. I also saw a Cessna high wing holding short of Runway 25 so I knew the Tower saw my squawk code. There was also another high wing Cessna holding short of the intersection on the north side of Runway 25. I called out that I was crossing the thresh hold of Runway 7. I then turned downwind for Runway 25. I was at an altitude of 2000 feet when I passed by the Tower. I rocked my wings and a steady green light was shining through the tower window. I confirmed this by turning my landing light off then on. I then proceeded to land as normal. I taxied off the runway to parking and immediately called the Tower and Razorback Approach to clarify what had happened. Both the Tower and Razorback Approach said the situation was handled very well. I then called the owner and chief CFI of my company; and told him of the situation. He advised me to go outside and start the engine to determine if the battery was dead. It was not. I called him back and told him the plane started fine; and then I asked him what I should do. I presented the option for someone to come pick us up; but he assured me that it would be OK to fly back with no radio's. He explained that I would need to call Razorback and the Tower to get a squawk code and everything would go smoothly. I made a call to the FSM Tower. A woman answered the phone and I told her my situation. She advised me that this operation would be permitted and gave me the squawk code. She said to point the aircraft at the tower when ready to taxi and she would flash a green light at us. Then taxi and hold short of Runway 25 and point the plane at her and she would again flash us the green light.  After departure turn right on course and proceed VFR. I told her ETA was XA:40 PM. We arrived at the airport around XA:36 PM and preflighted the aircraft. Around XA:48 the engine was started and we taxied to the edge of the taxiway and pointed at the tower. At this time squawk was entered as requested earlier. The steady green light was shown and we taxied on to taxiway Alpha. At this time we reviewed the plan of action when we hold short and also after departure. We approached the intersection of Runway 19-1 and taxiway Alpha and held short for 10 seconds. We did a rolling run-up to save time as we did not want to be caught in the dark. We held short of Runway 25 and pointed at the Tower. A steady green light was displayed and I confirmed this with the PIC. We then turned the aircraft to face toward the end of Runway 25 to check for traffic. No traffic was seen so we rolled out onto Runway 25. We applied power gradually to catch any last adverse light signal if it was given. No traffic was seen in front of the aircraft at this time. We climbed to 500 feet after field elevation and turned right at the end of the runway. Our heading was around 018 to avoid towers in the area.  After 10 minutes of flight we turned to a more direct heading of 010 and headed toward the Drake VOR. We entered the pattern at our home base and received a steady green light so we rocked the wings and turned the landing light off and on. After landing three ground crew members approached us and said we need to call this number which was presented on a green sticky note. I called the number and which turned out to be Razorback Approach. They said our flight was under investigation due to the fact that we taxied with no clearance from the Tower and we also departed with no clearance. The claim was made that we departed into oncoming traffic and we forced the traffic to divert from their plan of flight. At that Point I explained on the phone what I have written.",,,,"General aviation aircraft described loss of radio event; both as an arrival and subsequent departure; all allegedly coordinated with ATC as appropriate; ATC's questions regarding the event were like due to failed coordination.",

I received a FAA weather briefing prior to flight and there was no mention of the potential for turbulence. My plan was to cross the ridge at 3000 feet MSL. The air was warm and smooth as I departed KCMA and as such gave no indication of the encounter soon to come. Due to the warm temperatures; I kept the climb gradual; with the mixture rich; and the power less than full to keep the cylinder head temperatures down (there are no cowl flaps). This plan; I reasoned; would be more suitable than a direct climb to 3000 after after takeoff. As I got closer to the ridge crossing; I encountered significant turbulence and windshear suddenly with the aircraft departing its even trajectory and disrupting my plan. I focused on attitude control while trying not to lose orientation between the Class B; C; and D airspace in the adjacent area. The combination of focusing on aircraft attitude control and maintaining orientation of the the aircraft relative to the nearby Class B; C; and D airspace; led to lower than planned flight across the ridge. I had planned to climb; however; was not able to execute the climb. Contributing Factors 1. Flight path was near highly congested areas which includes Class; B; C; and D airspace all in close proximity. 2. The Cessna 152 is an aircraft with limited performance. 3. Assumption that smooth air would continue throughout flight regardless of localized terrain topography. 4. A relaxed composure prior to the rough air encounter. 5. The turbulence and windshear was most likely generated by onshore winds crossing the steep ridge line and uneven terrain heating. This placed my flight path on the leeside of the ridge. Human Performance: In retrospect; perception that 'everything' is going to 'plan' and relaxed composure led to poor future projections (in terms of situational awareness). A perception of the upcoming rough terrain with the likelihood of onshore winds should have led me to comprehend the potential of leeside turbulence; this should have have lead to a decision to climb much earlier than plan. The quality of the decisions made were based on my preconceived mind-set. That is: the route was chosen; the air was smooth; keep the cylinder temps under control; watch out for airspace and other aircraft; and enjoy a beautiful day for flying. This was a brimstone path. It is imperative that a pilot constantly remain engaged in the situational awareness process; constantly engaged in perceiving (rough terrain ahead!); comprehending (where's the wind?); and projecting (how will this possibly impact the flight?). The limitations of human performance may be limited by expectations. I expected a smooth and trouble-free flight on this flight - it's not what I encountered. I have flown in conditions substantially worse without concern or incident. The difference is that I was prepared for those conditions prior to flight. In this case; situational awareness suffered. Corrective Actions. 1. Climb to crossing altitude should have been accomplished earlier in flight; or; 2. Upon reaching the turbulence; a turn could have been made to the north through west to remove the aircraft from the environment. 3. Never being 'perfectly' relaxed on a flight. Always asking questions and coming up with alternate plans. The edge of the seat may be the place to fly from. Never forget that a situational awareness breakdown can get any pilot of any experience level. 4.

I have flown this aircraft before and documented its fuel burn at 2500' on a 2.00 hr flight to be 6.8 gph. It has a fuel capacity of 37.5 gallons total; 12.5 on the left and 25.0 on the right. I use FLTPLAN.COM to plan my trips and it shows about 7.5 gph average fuel burn; which gives an endurance fuel of 5.0 hrs. I started this trip with a standard preflight including sumping the tanks and checking the oil prior to moving the aircraft out of the hanger. I topped off the fuel tanks myself and took off from a private field. I got flight following through Center and about half way through; Center advised me they lost my transponder. I turned it off and back on and stopped getting a reply light. I continued to my destination. There I pulled and reset the transponder CB; visited with the owner and had the aircraft topped off with fuel. It took 22.21 gallons so my 3.0 hour flight showed a burn of 7.4 gph. I flew to my next destination in just under an hour. On contact with Tower there I was getting a reply light but they were not receiving my transponder. I showed the aircraft to a man (he did not fly it) then departed for home.  I was planning to continue through Class B Airspace before dark. I double checked my flight time and fuel burn and it looked fine but I thought since I was going to be landing after dark I might as well get some extra fuel. I had chosen an Executive airport because it was clear of Class B airspace and I would not have to bother ATC with my transponder problem again. Center cleared me direct to destination. As soon as I replied; my engine lost power. I turned on the auxiliary fuel pump and called 'Center I've power loss. What do you show as the nearest airport?' While making this call I pressed the NRST button on my 496. It showed a major airport 11.4 NM. Then Center called and said 120 degrees and about 11 miles. I replied 'that won't work--the engine has failed. I see what looks like a football field on my left.' As I bank to look; I pump the throttle and the engine regains power. I notice the auxiliary fuel pump pressure is 2.5 to 3--normal is 4.0. I realize I'm out of fuel and advise Center. While holding a left bank to keep the fuel flowing I started a climb and headed for nearest airport. The engine cut in and out as I tried to get all of the altitude that I could. I was advising Center all the way. They cleared me to land on any runway. I could see the runway and lights and had climbed to about 2700' when the engine quit running. I advised Center that the engine had failed and I was not going to make the airport. I saw two options; a bayou and a golf course. The bayou's banks looked steep; so it was my second choice. I started surveying the golf course to see if it was clear of people and to judge the distance of a clear way; keeping the bayou as an option and watching my altitude. Then; I saw a single person at the approach-end of a golf course. I committed to land and adjusted speed with slip and flaps. I had a normal touchdown; medium breaks; ending in a safe; normal landing. The propeller had stopped at about 500' AGL. My cell phone indicated the time of my phone call to Center to advise that I was safe and alive. The aircraft Hobbs meter showed only 3.4 hours since departing. About 3 hours of this was actual flight time. This would have been 11.02 gph burn for the full 3.4 hrs that the Hobbs indicated and 12.5gph for the 3hrs of flight. This led me to believe that the aircraft did not hold the full 37.5 gal that it was supposed to. After investigation; I decided to remove the wings of the aircraft and trailer it from the golf course to my airport. Two FAA investigators oversaw the metering of the fuel into the right wing and it turns out that the outboard tank did not vent properly. There are two 12.5 gallon tanks in the right wing for a total of 25 gal with a single fill port on the inboard tank. Itlooked topped off full at only 16.2 gallons. It turns out that the faster you fill the tank; the less fuel it takes to seem full; so when I showed full out I was about 12 gal short. Note the fuel gauges are on the inboard tank and showed full.",,,,"A C170 engine stopped from fuel starvation because the outboard tank in the right wing did not vent properly so when the tanks were filled only 16.2 gallons could be loaded instead of 25.",

I also had the Tower check the visibility south of the airport near where Aircraft X was going and they said it didn't look good. This was relayed to the aircraft. The pilot responded saying it looked OK to him and he continued to VT8. I continued to give him advisories and could see on RADAR that he was following the shoreline of Lake Champlain and then Route 7 to VT8. I did not tell the pilot to remain clear of Class C airspace as it looked like he was going to be clear of it enroute to his airport. I later found out that VT8 is included in our Class C Airspace to protect for the VOR 1 Approach which was not in use at the time. This is not found on our approach maps on the displays in the RADAR room. I did cancel automatic releases off BTV at the time the C152 passed west of BTV to ensure no conflicts with any departures. There were no departures delayed. The pilot reported VT8 in sight and I terminated RADAR and switched him to UNICOM. Since the pilot did not request SVFR and I couldn't offer it.

I drained all the water and took another sample that did not have any water in it. I started my flight and headed south. I climbed to 6500 FT MSL; VFR cruising altitude. Weather was clear to the south and visibility more than 10 SM with clouds to the west of my route. After approximately 50 minutes of cruising at 2500 RPM and 100 knots indicated airspeed in C152; I contacted Approach. I asked for flight following to continue my flight to my first stop for refueling. Once I got flight following; I flew for about 3-5 minutes. And then my RPM dropped from 2500 to 2300 and accelerated back to 2500. I quickly checked both magnetos several times. During the mag check; RPM would still sometimes drop 100-300 RPM and then accelerate back to normal. For the next couple minutes the engine was running fine. At that time I checked the mixture; oil pressure; fuel indicators; and fuel selector and decreased RPM to 2300. I checked the mags again and they worked fine. After I checked everything RPM dropped from 2300 to 1800 or maybe even more and accelerated back to normal. Then Approach talked to me and I decided to tell them that I'm experiencing engine problems and would like to land. They asked me if I 'm declaring emergency and I said yes. Approach asked me to describe the situation and say how much fuel I have on board. I told them I had more than half tanks and that my RPM drops and accelerates back. Then I decided to squawk an emergency code; 7700; but by mistake squawked 7500 and did not notice it. That created more problems. Approach asked me how many people I had on board and I said 1. They informed me of current weather and winds at a nearby airport and wanted me to contact them on ground. I changed frequency and announced myself on CTAF frequency. Descending down on long base I was at 80 knots at almost idle power settling. It seemed like the engine would still sometimes loose power even at idle setting. But because I was very high I didn't worry about it much. The runway was right in from of me; so I quickly descended and landed. After I landed the engine was running fine and I had no problems taxiing to parking. I shut the engine off when I arrived to the parking spot and contacted Approach and explained to them everything. When our school instructor and Mechanic came down to pick me up; they found some water when they inspected the engine. We still don't know the real cause of RPM drop; but most likely it was water. What I learned from my situation is to take more fuel samples before the flight and be more careful when squawking an emergency code. Other than that I'm thankful that everything went well.

While adjusting to go back onto the runway off to my right; the wing tip tapped the ground. After pulling back onto the runway I checked for any airframe damage. There was no damage that I could feel or see besides the propeller. A way to prevent this problem from happening is to practice landings at different airports around the area and not just be contained around the general area. What I really think happened was since there was great wind gust; the light Cessna 152 did slightly wheelbarrow effect and the propeller tapped the ground.",,"A student of mine went on his first solo cross country. After reviewing his flight plan and checking weather; we decided to postpone the trip due to thunderstorms. He rescheduled the flight for six and a half hours later in hopes the storms would pass. They had passed the aircraft home base well before that time and had just recently passed his planned destination. The weather report I viewed before endorsing his log book said wind direction and speed were approximately 100 at eleven knots; giving a crosswind component of roughly five knots. By the time he had arrived at that airport; the winds had increased significantly. During landing; the propeller struck the ground as well as the right wing tip. Although I cannot be certain; I believe a gust of wind; possibly leading to ballooning; in combination with the pilot's inability to compensate; may have been the direct cause of this incident. I also believe that; like many other incidents; there was a chain of events that led to this occurrence. The first possible problem being that; with the stress of planning; canceling; and re-planning the flight; he may have not been fit for flight. The second being the intense workload on the pilot during the en route phase of flight. He flew through a VFR corridor; requiring him to remain extra alert of other traffic while trying to maneuver around Class B airspace. The third being he would be landing at an unfamiliar airport and was not prepared for any unusual characteristics (such as gusty winds) of that airport. The fourth being that he was cleared to fly straight in to Runway 13 rather than flying the full traffic pattern he is used to. The fifth; and possibly the straw that broke the camel's back; being that the winds were simply greater than his piloting abilities. I believe the incident was a result of both errors on the student's part and on my part as an instructor. The student should have made the decision to abort the landing and make another attempt or divert to an airport with a lighter wind. As the instructor; I should have realized the potential problem and sent him on his first solo cross country to an airport he was familiar with; without an operating control Tower; and with as easy a route as possible.",,"A C152 student pilot on his first solo flight landed at an unfamiliar airport in gusty wind conditions and lost control of the aircraft.

A MIA Approach Controller called our 'I' sector for a manual hand off; the MIA Controller gave our controller the beacon code; call sign; type aircraft; destination and altitude.  The PBI Controller observed the code near the south boundary and called RADAR contact.  From the Flight Data position that I was working I recalled that I had a flight progress strip for that aircraft.  I went to the 'I' scope strip bay and showed the strip to the controller.  It looked like a fight plan someone had typed in using the ARTS because the equipment suffix was 'T' (the normal default).  The strip read VFR MIA..ISM; beacon 37XX; time E0155 the CID 464.  This was an IFR aircraft on a VFR beacon code and not routed via standard routing.  This lead to several issues: First; When MIA Approach enters a ARTS flight plan and it does not have a fix in our airspace and/or the line of flight does not enter our airspace they always have to call for a manual hand off because the ARTS does not recognize that the aircraft should be in our airspace.  If PBI wanted to provide continued flight following to ZMA then we have to amend the FDIO (Flight Data Input/Output) or call ZMA for a manual hand off.  It can lead to excessive land line coordination and be very distracting to the controller.  This night we were very slow but on busy days the MIA Approach Controller can; and does; call multiple times for manual hand offs.  I am not sure that they understand the problem for PBI; or if they feel that a land line call is easy and it is over for them.  These manual hand offs always result in work for PBI to solve if we intend to hand off to ZMA.  Second: The exchange between the MIA Controller and the PBI Controller was lacking a key piece of information.  Even though MIA stated the aircraft was at 6000 FT the beacon code the aircraft was on was a MIA VFR subset the aircraft was squawking 43XX; this has no MSAW processing.  The PBI Controller would not expect this aircraft to be IFR on that code especially when a NAS (National Airspace System) flight plan already existed and the aircraft was taken off the NAS code for some reason.  Third: The PBI Controller asked the aircraft if he was IFR and he said he believed so; since we only had a VFR NAS strip and the aircraft was on a MIA local VFR code I took the strip amended the flight path and altitude and the PBI Controller re-issued an IFR clearance just to be on the safe side.  We then had to drop the ARTS tag; force the new flight plan via FDIO into our ARTS; advise the pilot to squawk the NAS code 37XX; let the new code acquire on the scope; slew and enter on the tag because when it re-acquires it displayed on the RADAR scope on a ZMA Center tag; then slew and enter a hand off to ZMA and watched to be sure it flashed to the proper ZMA sector.  Last night we were slow; but imagine doing this process multiple times during a busy session.  Sometimes we have to ask a FLM (Front Line Manager) to do the land line coordination for manual hand offs to ZMA.  Forth: When the PBI Controller called the MIA Controller to ask why an IFR aircraft was on a VFR subset and recommended that he should have just changed his NAS flight plan to IFR; the MIA Controller said he would take it under consideration.  His answer does not indicate that he understands the MSAW processing or the impact for lost communications nor that PBI would have not considered this aircraft IFR on that beacon code.  PBI Controllers deal many times with flight plans that need some sort of correction from MIA Approach; either the aircraft will not hand off so they call for a manual hand off or the put in a new NAS code near the boundary and then flash that aircraft to us and when we try to hand off to ZMA we discover there are multiple fight plans in the system; either active or proposed.  It is more obvious when an aircraft displays either a double NN or an incomplete call sign.  We are very familiarwith full routing a call sign; finding there are multiples; strip requesting one; try to remove it if we can; then ARTS force the remaining one to us; amend the route into our airspace so we can hand off to ZMA.  This is a very labor intensive process for us.  This was a single incident but the problem we face with MIA approach is chronic; it has been mentions many times and does not seem to be of a concern to many above the FLM level either at PBI or MIA.  Recommendation; train the MIA Controller as to what the VFR subset is for and what the limitations are.  They need to know that if they are going to enter multiple flight plans it will have an impact to the NAS.  They need to know what impact excessive land line calling can do to the adjacent facility.",,,,"PBI Controller provided a detailed example of MIA TRACON's failure to insure proper beacon codes/flight plan information are contained in the data blocks/NAS prior to attempting hand offs.",

While taxiing for take-off I heard a student pilot's initial announcement on the CTAF frequency (122.8) that he was 6 miles out to the north of the airport coming in to land. Since there was nobody else in the pattern at the time; I departed from Runway 19 announcing my departure and calling my turns to every leg of the pattern on the CTAF (to the crosswind; and to the downwind). In the process of departing; I also tried to contact the student several times on the CTAF frequency to confirm his position; since his initial announcement and his intentions weren't clear. I got no response to any of my calls. Shortly after my turn from crosswind to downwind; when I was at the traffic pattern altitude (TPA) of 1;200 FT MSL; I observed the traffic coming quickly at me from the right (at my 1:30 o' clock) with the traffic being in the left descending turn; which was his apparent evasive maneuver to avoid me. Since my airplane is high-wing; and the student pilot was apparently descending; I didn't see him in my field of view until he was already a short distance away from my airplane and till he was already taking his evasive action. When back on the ground; I spoke to the student pilot (who apparently was on his 2nd solo flight; coming back from practice area to the airport) and his instructor. Student claimed he heard my calling out the legs of my traffic pattern (but not my calls addressing him!); and then he got disoriented while looking for me in the pattern. At the time of the incident; student pilot stated intention was to enter downwind for Runway 19 with 45 degrees entry; but instead he was flying as if about to join the downwind at 135 degrees; almost opposite the direction of traffic; and at the TPA. His proper entry should have been flying wide keeping to the left of the pattern (from his perspective) and then doing a course reversal to join downwind at 45 degrees angle. So basically; at the point where he was; he should have been flying much higher than the TPA; and then only descending to the TPA while making sure he's safely away from the pattern and after already having reversed his course to join the downwind. My other concern has to do with his instructor asking the student whether he took evasive action to the right. The suggested turn to the right would be obviously incorrect in this case and would more likely lead to a disaster. Even after my explaining the situation and drawing the diagram; which showed that the student's evasive action to the left was the appropriate one; instructor seemed to keep thinking (and instructing his student) that evasive turn to the right would be the appropriate action. This apparently shows lack of understanding on the part of the instructor that evasive action to the right is only appropriate in head-on and near-head-on approaches; but not with the angled approach paths as we were engaged on. Had the student mindlessly taken the right turn (as he was most likely drilled) he would end up flying into the path of my airplane or end up hitting me from the right at the 90 degrees angle. So the lessons to learn here are twofold: 1) apparent lack of understanding of the proper pattern entry at the uncontrolled airports; resulting in being too low (in this case right at the TPA) while overflying the pattern and prior to having joined it. 2) Lack of understanding by the instructor of the proper collision avoidance maneuvers; and insistence on drilled course of action ('always turn right') as a universal recipe for his students; which is completely inappropriate as a universal recipe.",,,,"A light plane pilot reported an NMAC with another light aircraft flown by a student pilot in the pattern at N07.",

Event took place at my regional airport on the ramp on startup.  I did my preflight and was ready to get into the airplane. I had the line guys top off the fuel tanks and I got in and cranked the engine. The engine starter would turn over but no audible sound was heard of any cylinder combustion whatsoever. The airplane was just previously flown and was already warm; not to mention that it was near 85 degrees outside.  It seemed weird that it had no combustion and just the starter was going; so I laid off on the ignition switch to keep from hurting the starter. I did this about twice or more; its hard to remember. I then thought to put some primer in because the engine was not previously primed.  After priming the engine I tried another crank. This time it still had no noticeable indication of any fuel combustion in the cylinders either.  After this ordeal; I assumed that I may have flooded it. (which makes no sense because the engine shouldn't have needed primer in the first place; but putting primer in would not hurt anyway cause its part of the checklist). I then did my flooded engine procedures to compensate. Around this time between the primer injection and the flooded engine procedures I heard a backfire or a loud detonation. I knew something was wrong and smelled smoke. I then proceeded to run the emergency ground fire checklist and cranked the engine to put the fire out but the ignition then died and nothing moved. By this time the lines guy was there to put the fire out. As far as I could tell the aircraft damages were a burnt induction filter and a blown battery. I have my own suspicions that that the battery may have been faulty due to some previous times that it needed a jump or two to get it cranked.",,,,"A C152's engine did not start on previous attempts and after priming the already warm engine it backfired; lighting the excess fuel and causing an engine fire.

I thought that after 50 hours of training; his English and flying skills were worthy enough to solo. I sent him to do the normal three landings while I watched on the side of the taxiway with my radio. After take off from 31R; he missed ATC instructions three times to make left traffic for 31L. Then; on the left downwind; he was cleared to land and instructed to follow Cessna on a two mile final. He responded to the radio call; but turned base too early; and failed to look for the traffic on final (he admitted later). This caused him to be way too close on final to other aircraft and Tower instructed him to go around and he came back and landed. These two events probably shook him up where he could not think straight. After he landed he was twice instructed to hold short of 31R for a landing aircraft and responded both times. He came up to the runway and stopped short of it but as soon as he stopped; he added power and crossed the runway without clearance; not listening to the Tower yelling at him. He explained after the flight that he got really nervous and blocked out what the Tower was saying and how he was not thinking straight. As an instructor; I realized that his situational awareness and communication skills need work; and that I should have helped develop those more. I also should have spent more time with him; giving non standard radio calls; so that he would get used to those types of instructions.

While I was doing the change over I had the plane plugged in to warm the engine and the oil. The change over took me 1.5 hours. When completed I then performed a preflight while he plane was still in the hangar and found the aircraft ready for flight. Also a check of the oil and cylinders found them both warm. The plane was then pulled out of the hangar and positioned for starting which was accomplished easily and the engine was run at idle for 15 minutes. Then a run up was completed no problems with mags or carb heat. The plane was ready to fly. The next step was to have my friend come aboard on the passenger side and secure for take off. I explained how I taxi on the snow and the take off procedure. I put in 10 degrees of flaps and applied power for the first run down Runway 30. The snow was light and fluffy and I made a track close to the end of the runway. I knew that I would not be able to take off the first time down the runway without making a track. By the end of 30; I executed a 180 turn and taxied back on my tracks to the take off point of Runway 12. Then another 180 turn for a take off following my tracks in the snow headed west. Full power was applied and the plane responded accelerating down the runway and after a short ways the tail wheel was off the ground. The plane was picking up speed and I was comfortable the take off would be successful at this time. As the plane proceeded down the runway and was getting closer to the end where lift off should have occurred the controls were light and I expected to be flying momentarily; however this did not happen. I had to make a decision at this point I could not stop the airplane. The plane was not flying and to the right of the runway was a barn full of milk cows and to the left was a substantial barb wire fence with large wooden post frozen in the ground which supported the wire. The land sloped down away from the runway and beyond the fence was another barn. I choose to maintain directional control straight ahead. The plane left the end of the runway over a bank and was in the air however it was not picking up enough speed. I lowered the nose slightly to pick up additional speed to maintain flight which did not happen. I was successful at maintaining directional control missing two large fence posts however just beyond them the left gear leg with ski hit a frozen pile of dirt breaking the ski off the spindle. The plane then turned left loosing altitude and the left gear leg began to drag on the frozen ground and through another barb wire fence. I knew flight was over and had pulled all the power off just before the plane landed on a sloping grade. An immediate check of my passenger found him not hurt and the master switch; mags and gas were shut off. The plane was positioned with the right wing high and the left wing low; exiting the plane was accomplished through the pilot's door. Once we were out and away from the plane we both did another safety check on each other finding us both unhurt. We both had cameras and took several pictures before heading to the farm house to let the owners of the farm know that I had just had an incident with an airplane in their cow pasture. The farmer was very kind and asked what he could do to help and I responded nothing right then. We then walked down the road back to the hangar where we started from and called the airport manager to report the incident and check who else should be called. The State Police were then called and informed of the incident and the Dispatcher informed me that the Airport Manager and the local police would handle the investigation. The Police arrived at the hangar along with the Fire Department then all of us drove back down to the farm. I had taken several empty gas containers expecting to be able to drain down the upper wing tank that was leaking out a little gas through the vent pipe. The police stopped me and said I could not touch the plane until it was released back to me from the FAA. I received a call from the FAA and was asked questions about the damage to the plane and asked if the passenger or myself sustained any injuries which we had not. I also inform him that there no property damage. The Lieutenant from the Fire Department asked me how much gas had leaked out and I responded about 1 to 1.5 gallons. I had also asked the Fire Lieutenant if I could disconnect the battery which did not happen until the FAA had informed the  Police that he was returning the aircraft back to me. Once returned I disconnected battery then set a container under the plane to drain down the right wing tank. While draining down the tank a state Department of Environmental Services Inspector walked down and asked how I was containing the spilled gas. I responded that the Fire Department had placed absorbent pads under the plane which collected the leaking gas. The Inspector provided me with more pads which I used to place over the other pads. The Inspector informed me to shovel the contaminated snow up into something to contain it and that a licensed company would have to pick the snow up for proper disposal. I used a trash can lined with a heavy plastic liner to accomplish the Inspector's request. The contaminated snow is presently at the hangar. The site was left for the night and a visit with the land owner set a time for the following day to move the plane back to the hangar. A few days later; I inspected the site for any additional contamination and found none; the farmer drove a 4X4 tractor to the site and we used the bucket with a strap sling to pick up the damaged gear leg and removed the broken ski hub from the spindle then installed a wheel. The gear leg was lowered and I installed a long sling around both landing gears connecting the end to the back of the tractor. We slowly pulled the plane ahead which worked nicely to move the plane back to the hangar. The sling was removed and the plane was pushed back inside.","The reporter stated that during the investigation of this event the only cause that he and authorities could plausibly attribute it to was carburetor ice. The aircraft was contamination free because it had been in the hanger and no snow was falling. The ground snow was thick and dry so some amount of friction was present.",,,"A C170B failed to develop flying speed during takeoff on snow skis; departed the runway end and impacted the ground damaging the landing gear.",

We use GATS jars to sample fuel and pour it back into the tanks. As I poured the fuel back into the tanks; I checked the fuel level visually in each tank and saw what I judged to be sufficient fuel for the flight; which I planned to be approximately 1/2 hour. One of the fuel gauges showed just over 5 gallons; which matched my estimate of the fuel in each from looking into the tanks; though the other gauge showed empty.During the climb-out; I became uneasy about the actual amount of fuel in the tank and decided only to do a couple of turns directly over the airport; rather than doing a half hour flight out of the pattern. The airplane performed well. I coordinated with the Tower to descend into the pattern for landing and taxied back to the maintenance area. In the process of discussing the various minor issues I'd noted; we 'dipped' the tanks and I was shocked to see that there was less than a gallon of usable fuel remaining in each wing.

The Student pilot was dispatched on his first solo flight after demonstrating four acceptable landings with an instructor. After an uneventful taxi; run up; and takeoff; the Student received his clearance for the option (touch and go; stop and go; low approach; or full stop) on downwind. The Instructor had directed the Student to make three stop and goes prior to dispatch. From the ground; it appeared the Student was making a normal approach and touched down within the first 500 FT of runway. However the aircraft; a C152; landed with no flare; possibly even in a nose low attitude. This caused the aircraft to land with excess airspeed and too much weight on the nose gear; the condition known as 'wheel barrowing'. When a tricycle airplane 'wheelbarrows'; there is a major loss of directional control due to little weight on the two main gear and too much weight on the nose gear. Combined with the excess airspeed from the lack of flare; this caused the Student pilot to be unable to correct for a left drift - the Student pulled power to idle and added right rudder pressure to counteract the drift; but control could not be obtained. The aircraft exited left of the runway. The Instructor attempted to receive a clearance from both Ground and Tower via radio to proceed to the aircraft but could not obtain contact. The Instructor then made the incorrect decision to proceed to the aircraft; approximately 100 FT on the controlled side of the 'DO NOT CROSS' line. After the event; the Instructor contacted Tower via cell phone and was strongly reprimanded for the incorrect and unsafe decision. Tower warned the Instructor but decided not to file a 'Personnel Deviation Report'. The Student Pilot had demonstrated in the past a lack of awareness while flying the aircraft. However he had appeared to improve his ability to fly the aircraft by the time of his solo flight. The Student had been told many times by his Instructor that if any anomalies occur in the landing phase; whether being high; low; fast; or slow on final; bouncing; or ballooning on landing to perform a go-around. The Student's decision to attempt to salvage the landing instead of performing a go-around lead to the aircraft exiting the runway. The Instructor had never simulated a wheel barrowing condition; and the Student's unfamiliarity with the situation played a factor in his incorrect decision making. The runway surface was also wet due to intermittent light rain. While the aircraft did not hydroplane; the wet surface may have played a role in the aircraft's lack of ability to achieve directional control. Had the Student flared the aircraft correctly during the landing phase; the situation would have been avoided. After entry into the situation; had the Student performed a go-around at the first indication of no directional control; the aircraft would have been able to avoid the runway excursion. Had the Instructor ensured that the Student would have had the proper reaction to the situation through more simulations of faulty landings; the Student may have made the correct decision to perform a go-around.",,,,"An Instructor pilot observing his Student pilot's first solo landing reported that the aircraft landed on its nose wheel and eventually drifted off the runway.

Because it wasn't very far from our home base (just over the 50 mile mark); I didn't worry about a flight plan and the weather seemed to be nice all over. After taking off and establishing cruise; I initiated some more light conversation with the student as it was our first flight together. When [we were] almost there I switched on the weather report to listen to the numbers. The student didn't bother getting flight following and since it was our first flight together and his last before finishing commercial license; I let it slide. While listening to the AWOS I think maybe he was still talking to me and I got a bit distracted after hearing the report when it got to the remarks section. In the remarks the report indicated the lights were off; but I just figured it wouldn't be a problem as I had the runway in sight and an aircraft on the taxi way. The moon was full and so the runway was quite visible as far as the color and outline. When the aircraft touched down I noticed something out front on the runway. The student nicked the edges of it. We taxied the plane back to find out what it was. The runway was closed. Luckily the runway was not torn up yet; but we hit the yellow X. After inspecting the plane and the X no damage was done. We opted for a very short field takeoff and went home with no more problems. Listening to the AWOS again on the way out I found the runway was closed and the taxiway was being used for operations during the day. This is a mistake I will not make again.",,,,"A C152 instructor and student landed at night on a closed runway after the instructor listened to the AWOS but failed to hear the Remarks because of his student's conversation.",

I checked the weather [and] found it to be few-scattered around 2;000 along their route. I looked at the trend of the METARs; looking back 5 hours; and got the impression conditions were improving. I wrote the cross country endorsement with a limitation of ceiling more than 4;000 FT; and told him it was ok to stay above few or scattered clouds. He took off (flight block from 10-13). Some time after I met another student of mine; whom I had sent on the same cross country flight at the same time; he had turned back approximately abeam MMV; where he said there was an overcast layer [at] 2;200. He lost flight following descending to get below clouds; and decided to come back. I asked him if he had heard my other student on the same frequencies; but he hadn't. At this time I checked the company GPS tracking system to find out where the first student was. He seemed to be in close proximity of CVO; and I decided there was not much I could do; and I went out on another flight with another student. The student came back safe; but I did not see him anymore that day. I checked his track on the company GPS tracking system; and found out he had been at a low altitude around the Salem area; and he had busted Salem Class Delta airspace. I called him and asked what frequencies he had been using after he lost flight following; and specifically if he had been talking to Salem Tower. My first impression was that he had been talking to MMV and 7S5 CTAF's. He now tells me he has been talking to Cascade Approach; though I suspect he had been handed off from Cascade Approach without realizing it. I do not know if Cascade Approach has radar coverage at 1;500 FT MSL around Salem airport. The reason I sent the students was that I thought the weather was improving; and even if it didn't; I would be comfortable with them going over a few scattered clouds. I talked them through the endorsement and pointed out that they could not continue flying if there was a layer of clouds (specifying BKN or OVC) lower than 4;000 FT. As they both reached the lower than forecast weather; one student decided to come back; and I gave him praise for his decision making. The other student kept on going; descending below the clouds. I have talked to the student after the incident; and shown him the company GPS tracking system that shows him inside Class D at SLE. The student understood that he had done something wrong; and I do not think the student will ever attempt anything like this again.",,"After takeoff [I] contacted Departure and climbed to 3;500 FT. After passing over MMV airport; I began descent and offset the route due to cloud. I just remember 'do not fly into the cloud' but forget the endorsement required ceiling 4;000 FT. Before arrival at Salem I contacted Cascade Approach. Without knowing I entered the Salem Class D airspace. Then about 10 miles north of CVO airport the Cascade Approach told me change frequency to CVO. I remember over Corvallis city altitude was 1;700 FT. I made one touch and go at CVO airport then back to home field. The weather was getting better on my way back. After departure from CVO I contacted Cascade Approach to request flight following and Approach said 'radar contact'; [and] over Independence altitude was 2;000 FT.",,"Instructor and student describe the events surrounding a solo student cross country that continues into cloud coverage less than prescribed by the solo endorsement.

The Conflict Alert (CA) alarm had gone off as the C152 was rolling for an aircraft in right crosswind to downwind. Our attention was removed from the aircraft on final momentarily. When Local noticed separation would not exist he quickly told the C172 to go around after the aircraft had just crossed the threshold; only he called him by the wrong call sign. The C172 never went around and ended up landing safely. Although the C172 had crossed the threshold before the C152 was 3;000 FT; from my vantage point it appeared as if the C152 had offset slightly north of the runway on a heading of 270.

The C172 had called inbound and was initially 2 1/2 miles south of final abeam the PA46 and indicating 60 KTS faster. The C172 was told to fly directly to the numbers and maintain maximum forward speed to ensure proper spacing. The C172 was then observed reducing speed to approximately 110 KTS and was angling towards a 5 mile final and not directly towards the numbers as instructed. The C172 was then told to remain south of final until he had the aircraft in sight and to not intercept the center line until he had the traffic. The C172 informed the Tower that they had the traffic and that he was no factor. The PA46 had not contacted the Tower so the Controller reached out to see if the PA46 was on frequency. The PA46 said they were and the Tower immediately issued a traffic advisory of the aircraft to their left and informed them that the traffic said they had them in sight. The PA46 said they were looking. The Tower issued a second traffic advisory and the PA46 said they had the traffic moving to their 12 o'clock and pulling away. The Tower told the PA46 to follow the traffic and cleared them to land. At no time did either pilot indicate there was a near mid air collision. The pilot of the PA46 called later to report the incident. The pilot of the PA46 made it clear when he called that he was satisfied with the air traffic service and felt the Controller did what was necessary to provide separation and traffic advisories. The main reason for his call was to turn in the other pilot for 'reckless flying' and he felt that filing a NMAC was the best way to put the incident on the other pilot's record in case of future incidents. The pilot of the C172 stated on the phone that he had the other aircraft in sight the whole time and felt that it was a 'non-incident'. A pilot deviation should be filed against the pilot of the C172 due to the fact that he did not comply with initial instructions to alter his course and increase speed.

I added left rudder to keep the aircraft on the center line; instead of aircraft turning to the left it lifted the right wing and at that second I noticed there is something wrong since the wind was reported calm.

This time the aircraft showed a drift to the left followed by lifting the right wing again.

My first thought was that I was experiencing fuel starvation; so I confirmed that the fuel cutoff valve was still in the open position and that the throttle and mixture were still full forward. I then executed a steep 180 degree turn to the left and landed on the flat ground in front of the new; still unopened ATC Tower; about 250 FT from Runway 23. The landing was uneventful; with no injuries to myself and no damage to the aircraft. The engine; which was still turning over slowly; died after the plane came to a stop. After about a minute; I attempted a restart; and the engine started immediately. I taxied across the flat ground until I could get onto Runway 23 to cross it to the taxiway; and then returned to the tie down area to determine what to do next.Prior to this incident I had flown in from my home base and parked the plane near the avionics shop for reinstallation of a radio that they had cleaned and retuned. I returned to the plane about an hour later. I did not sump the fuel tanks and lines at that time because I had done that prior to the inbound flight. I taxied to Runway 23 and did a run-up; which was normal. My engine analyzer showed normal temperatures during the run-up.After the incident; I did several run-ups to 2400 RPM; but there was no sign of what caused the engine loss. I checked under the cowling but everything was in place. I sumped the fuel tanks and lines; but found no contaminants. I then asked the Service Manager at the FBO to have a mechanic check the plane.After a few hours; the Service Manager told me that two mechanics with long experience in general aviation had given the plane a close inspection; including a compression check of the engine and a complete review of the fuel system. The only discrepancy they had found was a mud dauber nest well inside the fuel vent tube under the left wing. They cleared the obstruction and checked to see that the engine was running correctly.Once the plane was returned to me; I did a normal run-up and departed. The return flight was uneventful.A blockage of the vent tube would explain the gradual decrease in engine power; especially since the engine was drawing maximum fuel for takeoff at full throttle; mixture rich and the nose was at a steep angle upward. I thought that the vents in the fuel tank caps were supposed to ensure fuel flow if the vent tube became blocked; but this does not appear to be the case. They may have been designed only to keep the fuel tanks from crumbling if a vacuum built up inside. If so; a fuel vent tube blockage represents a single point of failure.I later looked for more information about mud daubers to see if they can build a nest in less than an hour and in what season they are active. I plan to get a pipe cleaner or wire to poke into the vent tube during preflight to check for blockage. I may also use some lightweight screening material to make a vent tube cover for while the plane is on the ground.I cannot say for certain why it came into my mind to return to the airfield for landing. I knew that I had a large expanse of flat open ground to my left as I was taking off; and I rolled out of the steep left turn after 180 degrees; not the 270 degrees I would have needed to make it to the runway. Although I did not consciously choose the open ground as a landing spot; I accepted it as a suitable place as I rolled out of the turn.I may have stalled the plane during the turn; because I found after I came out of the turn that I was in a dive; had pulled the yoke back to its rear stop; and had no elevator effectiveness. The ailerons; however; had remained effective enough for me to end the turn. While I was thinking about what to do to recover from the dive - keep the yoke back or push it forward - the elevator began to take effect and the plane leveled off. My decision to turn back was influenced in part by my reading a recommendation to perform a steep turn if turning back and by my having practiced steep turns because of this recommendation. I imagine that if I had practiced lowering the nose and looking ahead for a landing place; I might have done that.",,,,"When his engine started to lose power shortly after takeoff the pilot of a C-152 elected to attempt to turn back to the runway but was unable to do so and landed on flat ground still on the airport proper.",

Shortly there-after; a C182 checked in on frequency at the same time LGB Tower was calling to advise that the C182's transponder wasn't showing a squawk code. After hearing LGB Tower over the speaker; I immediately issued the correct code to the C182; and then answered LGB Tower acknowledging their call. I observed a target near LGB's departure corridor at 400 FT 1 NM west of the airport. I assumed that was the targets I was waiting to 'Tag Up'. At the same time; I issued a heading of 200 degrees to the C152 for climb above arriving traffic to TOA and also to sequence behind other en route traffic he was following. While issuing that heading; I placed a 'bat' on the target I thought to be the C182 and saw the 'bat' pointing northeast bound. Not a heading any departure would be on. Immediately I turned the C152 back to a heading of 160 for divergence. The pilot of the C182 then replied that they got their transponder working; and they tagged up on their code about 2 NM northwest of the C152.

When I touched down I was again blown off the centerline and rolled off the runway striking and breaking a runway edge light. The Fire Department came out we pushed the plane onto Taxiway Lima from where I taxied back to general aviation. No damage was apparent on the plane. I think a factor that influenced this was on my base to final turn; I noticed a heavy plane on final as well. He was also cleared for landing following me and said he was on a 6 mile approach. He then said he couldn't see the traffic on final; which was me. He was instructed to go around and I think not knowing whether he was landing or going around put pressure on me because I felt that I couldn't go around.

After flying over midfield; however; the fluctuations had grown to 250 RPM drops. I advised Tower of the issue and that I needed to spiral over the left downwind leg for Runway 25 but they asked for me to spiral to the South. They asked if I was going to declare an emergency.

Controller then advised the supervisor she wanted it split because of volume and complexity. I rushed over and opened RADAR Y; took the airspace and frequencies. A C152 was on vectors north of the airport to remain clear of the airport departure corridor and was told he was on vectors to the airway. A couple minutes later he asked if he should join the airway which was not possible because he was paralleling the airway. I advised him to continue heading 100; a couple minutes later I turned him right to heading 150 descend to 5;000 and intercept the airway which he did. Once he was established on the airway; a B737 departed the airport on the SID; which will put him on a crossing path with the C152. I began coordinating an early turn leaving 6;000 for the B737 with the Departure Controller to top the C152. When my attention went back to the scope; I heard the end of someone speaking but did not comprehend what was said. I stated 'calling Approach say again' and the same person responded with something I couldn't comprehend. I slowed another B737 arriving the airport to 170 as requested by the Final Controller and switched an A320 to Final Controller at the neighboring airport. I then went back to the aircraft that I couldn't understand and caught him saying that 'we are diverting and request vectors' to what I thought was another Sectors airport. Since a nearby airport was holding aircraft earlier over the VOR; I thought an aircraft had gone missed approach and was requesting vectors to a divert airport. I asked the aircraft if he was over the holding airport; to which I got a response that I could not understand; asked the aircraft to say position; same result. I then advised the aircraft to contact Approach on another frequency thinking that this aircraft was lost. Once the aircraft left the frequency; and I had a second to think; I realized that the aircraft was my own aircraft; I immediately called the other Sector and asked them to switch that guy back to me; they did; and advised that he was having engine troubles. Once he returned to my frequency I began vectoring the C152 to the Class C Airport. He reported seeing the Class C Airport out of about 3;200 but the Class C Airport was reporting OVC012. I asked him to verify that he did in fact see the Class C Airport; once again he did say that he had the Class C Airport in sight. I instructed him to proceed direct to the Class C Airport. He then started a turn to the north away from the Class C Airport towards the wrong airport. I asked if he had the other airport in sight and he realized that he was looking at the wrong airport; he asked if he could land at the other airport; I was not sure if the runways were occupied or not so I turned and asked the supervisor and no one had a definite answer. I then issued additional vectors to the Class C Airport and continued to issue clock positions and distances to the Class C Airport. When the C152 was about 5 miles from the Class C Airport I asked if he had turned on his carb heat; he responded with 'yes'; it is on. Out of about 1;200 the C152 reported the Class C Airport in sight and I cleared him to land any runway. After the incident I reviewed the tapes and play back; I remember the coordination between myself and the adjacent Departure Controller; which was why I missed the initial calls from the C152. The C152 called and stated 'engine failure; engine failure' and I didn't hear it. During the event; I was not able to comprehend the majority of the C152's transmissions. After hearing the tapes he sounds clear enough to understand; I don't know if that was because of noise in the area; and I had a hard time hearing over the background noise.",,,,"TRACON Controller described the handling of an emergency aircraft noting a number of less than clear and missed communications by the aircraft in question.",

During preflight I noticed the left fuel tank was 1/4 full and the right fuel tank 1/2 full indicating 20 gallons of fuel or 2.7 hours according to the gauges and a look into the tanks. This should be plenty of fuel for a less than 22 hour flight. For maintenance purposes; I wanted the left tank empty. I departed with the fuel selector on 'both;' switching to the left tank at 3;500 FT over the Reservoir. I switched the fuel selector to the right tank about 10 miles from the flights midpoint thinking I had about 2 hours fuel left for the additional 43 minutes to my destination. When I switched from left to right tank the gauge indicated 1/2 full. I checked 1 minute later and again in 1 more minute and the gauge still indicated 1/2 full. I checked the gauge again in 2 minutes and it indicated empty. The right gauge sender was overhauled one month earlier and this was the first tank of fuel since repair. This new reading caused some concern so I pushed 'nearest' on my GPS. It informed me a suitable airport was 7.5 miles to my 7 o'clock. I immediately turned toward it and looked on my chart for the frequency. The airport I selected was a Class E airport and not sensing an error I dialed in 122.8 and announced my intentions to that airport CTAF traffic. I could see the airport runway and saw no traffic and hearing nothing; I said I would land down wind on Runway 14. I did just that noticing an aircraft several hundred feet above me and climbing. The reason I was looking for traffic was because I was landing down wind and if I saw traffic I could have used the taxiway; grass or ramp for that matter; if necessary. I landed; taxied off to the ramp area and shut down. A fellow in an airport truck drove up to me and said I did not contact the Tower. He was correct as I contacted the wrong airport. When I saw this airport on my GPS and on my chart I did not realize there were two airports with same name. The gentlemen gave me the Tower phone number which I called immediately to explain what happened. He was very nice and handed me off to his boss. I explained to them as well; adding that I thought it was safer to do what I did instead of taking a chance the gauge was correct on last reading and try to continue; run out of fuel and land in hostile terrain. Landing at an airport and purchase fuel seemed to be my best option; so that is what I did. The Supervisor informed me that their Supervisor would like to call me the next day or week so I provided both my home and cell numbers. I then filled the right tank with 20 gallons telling me there were 6 gallons left. I then followed proper procedures and departed for my destination. The most egregious error made by me was landing at a towered airport using the wrong frequency. I did not actually see the Tower until I shut down and was told where to look. I was far more focused on flying the aircraft and a safe landing than anything else due to a perceived) low fuel problem. I now know there are at least two same name airports. I discovered the airport I used has several names. This is a bit confusing to a tourist. In the future I shall be more careful in selecting the proper frequency for the airport I intend to use as this has never happened to me before. I shall get the gauge problem resolved.",,,,"A C-170 pilot became concerned that his fuel system was malfunctioning and so landed at the nearest suitable airport which turned out to be towered but he confused it with a similarly named nearby CTAF airport.",

I was on an approved transition through Chino's Class D airspace. A departing twin turbine helicopter departed Chino airport and was provided with my position; altitude; and direction of flight. I spotted the helicopter as it rapidly accelerated and climbed directly toward my aircraft. As I evaluated the helicopter's flight path (it looked like it was still accelerating and climbing toward me); I began a turn to maneuver away from the helicopter when it turned to the north and then I lost sight of it. I scanned from right to left when I saw the helicopter passing just beneath me to my left side. The helicopter continued its climb. It is bewildering why the helicopter which has the ability to hover and is unconstrained by minimum altitudes required of airplanes would continue to accelerate and climb toward called out traffic. In my opinion; the helicopter should have slowed down and maintained 1;500 FT MSL until positively identifying my aircraft or crossing the highway. The helicopter has excellent visibility both above and below with a windscreen that extends from the pilot's feet to over their head. With such excellent visibility; climbing up and toward a blue sky; the pilot should have been in an excellent position to spot my aircraft without getting so close. They should have slowed down and leveled off to mitigate collision hazard and lower flight risk. Most general aviation airplanes have fairly poor visibility especially to the right side from the left seat; the pilot's perspective is limited. In addition; when a pilot is looking down; as I was; it is easy to lose traffic targets as those targets can easily blend into the industrial landscape. Further; while the regulations do not specify helicopters in the right away rules; practice is that more maneuverable aircraft gives the right-of-way to the less maneuverable aircraft.",,,,"Cessna 152 pilot transiting CNO airspace reported an NMAC with a helicopter climbing out of CNO.

I was in a hurry to get my flight done in order to get to my next class in time and decided to not properly brief myself with a takeoff briefing before entering the active runway. Upon entering the runway; instead of turning left onto Runway 14L; I turned right onto Runway 32R. I wasn't paying attention to the fact if I was on the correct runway and proceeded to takeoff at which point the Tower called up and said 'Abort takeoff clearance'. They then gave me instructions to 'When able do a 180 on the runway and proceed with takeoff'. That is the point I realized I had started to takeoff down the opposite runway but still followed their instructions and made a 180 on the runway and proceeded with takeoff. The rest of the flight went fine and upon landing I was instructed to contract Tower for possible pilot deviation. What I was not aware of during this occurrence was the fact that there was another airplane also taking off on a crossing runway. While they were already on the climb out; I had apparently crossed into the intersection while doing my 180 degree turn and that's where most of the fault was at. The fact that I had crossed the hold short lines into another active runway while another plane was on the climb out is what was dangerous. My decision to rush the flight and skip important steps that would have otherwise prevented this was a poor decision on my part. The obvious mistake for me was to skip the takeoff briefing to reassure myself of which runway I was taking off on. This being the case I have now learned the importance of being a meticulous pilot not only in the air but also on the ground. Whenever I am tempted to rush a flight or skip some things that would expedite my flight I can look back and think of this situation to rectify that feeling. I can also use this as a teaching point for later down the road of when I obtain my CFI as a great example of how hazardous these attitudes can be. Thankfully nobody was hurt but something bad could have happened and this serves as a great example of that.",,,,"A C-172 pilot rushed to become airborne after receiving Runway 14L takeoff clearance and mistakenly turned right onto 32R.

Returning to the airport.  I tuned my radio to obtain the ATIS. I was not able to receive the ATIS. I monitored the Tower frequency to see if I could hear any of the controllers or traffic in the airspace. I did not pick up any radio transmissions. During this time I switched back to the ATIS and could not receive the weather. At that point I decided to contact Tower hoping my radio would transmit and I would be able to receive the Tower's response.  I did a series of 360 degree turns while communicating my intentions to land; waiting for a response. I made an initial radio call to the Tower stating: '[Call sign] is 6 NM to the North inbound full stop. I have failed radios and need light signals to land.' I waited for a response; did not receive one; and did not hear the Tower communicating with other planes in the airspace. I realized my radios had completely failed and I had a radio emergency. I continued to [a nearby airport].When I felt it was safe to start moving closer to the runway; I entered the Class D airspace. I felt moving closer to the runway environment within the airspace would help me obtain a better visual of the Tower and any light gun signals.  I never received any signals. I was not able to receive or transmit on my radios.  I continued updating my position from the airport; asked for light gun signals; and continued to re-transmit my initial call to the Tower at least 3 or 4 times.

I landed the aircraft safely; and taxied off the runway. I called over the radio and pulled onto the ramp and parked. I then called the FBO asking them if they wanted me to leave the plane for Maintenance or bring it back.  They sent an instructor with a small hand held radio to use to bring the plane back to [the departure airport]. I still was not able to transmit or receive with the radios on the airplane. At this point I had a good handheld radio that would allow me to communicate to the Tower so I squawked the standard 1200 VFR transponder code. I conducted my run-up on the ramp. I ended up making all my radio calls with the handheld radio; as well as monitoring the weather; CTAF; and Tower frequencies. I could hear the Tower talking to the other traffic in the pattern and clearing them for takeoffs and landings. However; the Controller never addressed my call sign; or indicated that he heard my radio transmissions. I waited a few minutes before making the same call again. I did not get any response from Tower. At this point I knew my handheld radio was not transmitting; but I could hear the Tower and the surrounding traffic. I realized I was having another radio failure emergency requiring me to squawk 7600. I entered the Class D airspace to wait for light gun signals. I moved to within 4 NM of the runway environment and continued doing 360 degree turns while I waited to receive light signals from the Tower.  I continued to update my position; intentions; and continued to request light signals; explaining I had weather information Golf; two more times. I was circling in the airspace for at least 10 minutes; never received light signals; or a transmission asking about my intentions. I heard the Tower at one point on talking about an aircraft doing 360 degree turns; the Controller was advising another aircraft; or helicopter traffic that the intentions of the unidentified plane in the airspace were unknown.  I had enough space to observe the traffic in the airport pattern.  I made radio calls with my handheld radio on the CTAF frequency.  I initially called and reported that I was 3 NM to the West and would be entering the 45 for a right downwind to Runway 15 for a full stop landing; and that I had a radio failure emergency. I determined the traffic in the pattern had landed on the runway and I began to fly the 45 to set up on right downwind for Runway XX. I also made the standard radio calls for my right base leg as well as final leg for a full stop landing on Runway XX.I received a call from the Tower and explained everything that happened in detail....

He asked the location of the M020. I gave him a traffic call and he replied that he did not have the traffic insight. In the meantime a C182 was VFR on a practice ILS 6 approach. He called for a clearance. I cleared him to land number 2. I went back to C152 and told him to extend downwind and that he would now be following a C182 and called the traffic to him at 11 o'clock and three miles. He said roger and read it back exactly the same. I asked him if he had the traffic insight. He said no. At that time it appeared that he was starting to turn a left base. I told him 'Do not turn base.' He replied that he was landing. I asked him if he had the traffic insight and he said yes at his three o'clock. I went to the C182 and asked if he had traffic insight since he was about a 1/2 mile final. He said; 'Yes; is he cutting in front of us.' I said it looks that way and gave him a right turn and climb. I told C152 that he just turned in front of the traffic he was following. He just replied that he was landing. I asked him to call the TRACON Supervisor when he was out of the plane. The pilot in question is a foreign student pilot. One of the flight school's at the airport has a contract with a couple different countries that send people over to get trained. We have on occasion told the flight instructors that there is a language barrier problem with the students. This particular pilot clearly only understands a few key phrases of ATC phraseology. We have been working collaboratively on scheduling a meeting with the flight school owner; instructors and FSDO. This just happens to be one of many instances where language has been a problem and unsafe situations have come up. As stated above; a meeting with the flight school owner; instructors and FSDO is being put together. The instructors need to ensure that the students are proficient enough in speaking and understanding English and ATC phraseology before allowing them to be on their own or prior to being certified. This particular pilot just that night received his license.",,,,"Tower Controller described a sequencing event when a student pilot turned in front of a straight-in aircraft on a practice approach; the reporter identified a language barrier as a possible causal factor.",

The departure was uneventful. Approach vectored me west over an interstate highway; at which point I canceled VFR flight following. I did not want to fly over the swamp area; and was clear of all Class B airspace and any approach areas into surround airports. After a brief cruise northbound over an interstate the aircraft began to act peculiar. I was setting up the aircraft to be prepared for night flight by turning on the cabin lights to an appropriate setting and noticed they would steadily dim and brighten. I also began to notice a very faint thumping sound in my headset that sounded similar to strobe lights being activated. After another twenty minutes of flight the noise in my headset persisted and the lights continued to dim and brighten. Curious as to the noise; I shut of the strobe lights to the aircraft; and the noise persisted. Upon turning those back on a very loud screeching noise pierced the headset. At this point I had become aware something odd was occurring. I monitored the ammeter and the low voltage light; but neither showed any signs of failure. No circuit breaks had been popped at this time. Determined to figure out the problem before descending and landing; I flew more west than desired of course to stay above known airports. The problems continued to get worse. The VOR receiver moved erratically; the noise continued in my headset and the lights continued to dim and brighten in the cockpit. I began to shut off equipment; not thinking I had yet had an electrical failure. I shut off my COM1; intercom in the aircraft; aircraft strobe lights (not required for night) and aircraft cockpit lighting. I opened up my airports facilities directory and began looking at nearby airports information.When arriving over the airport many things began to fail. My handheld weather radar began to run off of battery power; all cockpit lights failed when I tried to turn them on; the navigation lights on the wings began to dim and the noise continued to become louder when I turned on my COM1. I quickly made a call to Approach; attempting to see if I had a radio failure. I listened to the frequency on a handheld radio; and even attempted to call Approach using that device. I received no transmission back or any other indication of a successful transmission.I decided to initiate a decent into the airport. I was near the airfield as I could identify the city and lakes that would have been near the airfield; however I could not positively identify the airport. However; I detected the beacon for a known airport to the Northwest. I flew direct to it and used my handheld radio to turn on the lights at the airfield. Making calls on the radio (using a handheld device) I landed Runway 10-28. On the approach however; I did call the runway 'Runway 9.' I had all electrical equipment except transponder turned off at this point. I lowered my flaps as I would normally for an approach; but had only gotten approximately 5 degrees out. I treated this as a 'no-flaps' landing; and exited to the right of the runway on the first available taxiway. At this point I called the aircraft owner; my flight instructor and my father. I was given guidance to cross over to the north ramp area where I tied down the aircraft in front of the terminal. I spoke with my instructor and the aircraft owner and explained what happened. I also got a call from a man who works with the flight school explaining the FAA wanted to confirm everything was fine- no damage to myself; the airport or any airplanes. The FAA recommended I use VFR flight plans for future flights and indicated (as I had thought) that no laws were broken and no lives were jeopardized in my flight. I left a note for the airport facility on the dashboard of the aircraft and spent the night in a nearby hotel. The next day I met the airport manager and local mechanic. The aircraft owner flew down; replaced the alternator and we flew the aircraft back with no further problems.",,,,"A Cessna 150's alternator failed gradually and insidiously on a night VMC flight so after recognizing the problem the pilot landed at an airport en route.",

A company instructor on a different aircraft spoke up and told me that the pilot was going to S39 not TTD. Now his route of flight made more sense. These pilots were out in full force today because the weather was nice. It was an unpleasant reminder that their substandard English speaking skills have not been properly addressed by FSDO; the flight school or the instructors before they let them out into the system. It is an exponential increase in workload with these pilots and there are times when controllers can't or refuse to provide service to them knowing the extra workload they can impose. Even then these pilots still don't always understand unable and that is a real problem! Pilots need some standard of measurement which is not 'biased' by any particular flight school or instructor. There is a huge incentive for the school and instructors to overlook substandard English speaking skills. What I understand is that these pilots are here for training only and when they are done they return to their home country. They pay many times more than the local students for their flight training so the propensity to overlook substandard English skills is very strong.

I did a brief walk around of the plane; removed all tie-downs and prepared the plane for taxi. Following the cold-start checklist I primed the plane and cranked the starter. The plane exhibited it's usually difficulty in starting when cold which caused me to crank the starter for multiple lengthy attempts (the plane's behavior was very similar to what I had experienced both with my CFI and on my solo flights). After several unsuccessful attempts to start the plane the battery began to show signs of running down; as evident by a slower turning speed of the engine starter. At this point I stopped attempting to start the plane in order to allow the battery to recover a bit and allow the starter to cool. While sitting there I noticed smoke coming from the engine cowling. I had already shut down the plane (master switch; keys) and exited the plane to investigate the source of the smoke. Once outside I observed both smoke and a small amount of flame coming from the engine compartment. I shut off the fuel valve; dialed 911; requested the fire department and then searched the inside of the plane for a fire extinguisher; but did not find one. I then removed as many items as I could from the cabin. While I was removing items; the engine began cranking on its own (no keys in the ignition). I rushed to re-secure the rear tie down to prevent the plane from moving and then stood clear. As this was going on; another member of the Flying Club arrived and deployed a small fire extinguisher from his vehicle. The fire extinguisher had a positive effect on the engine fire; but did not fully extinguish it. The fire department then arrived and extinguished the remaining fire.

Local Control told the pilot of the C152 to extend upwind and Tower would call his crosswind. The pilot did not read the instruction back so Local Control repeated the instruction. The C152 started a right turn and then asked if he could start his crosswind. Local Control tried to get him back to the upwind to follow the RV7 but by this time the C152 was already starting a right downwind. The RV7 was well outside of the C152 also on right downwind. Local Control then told the C152 to fly over the field for a left downwind but instead the C152 started a left turn which put him in proximity to the RV7. Local Control asked the RV7 pilot if he had the C152 in sight and the pilot said that he did. The RV7 maneuvered to avoid the C152. Both the Local Controller and I saw the entire situation and the two aircraft did not appear to be in unsafe proximity to each other. The RV7 continued on a right downwind and the C152 eventually followed. The pilot of the RV7 called the Tower about 10 minutes after he landed and sounded upset. He said that his heart was racing and that he and the C152 were within 'tens of feet' of each other. However; the pilot did not use the words near mid-air or NMAC. I had already called the FBO where the C152 is based; and advised Dispatch of what had happened with the student solo pilot. Because the RV7 pilot had called; I filed an MOR under 'public inquiry.' I recommend to all my ATCs that they not repeat the same instruction but instead; if an instruction doesn't appear to be clear the first time; issue an alternate instruction. In this case; the Local Controller could have said 'fly straight ahead' or 'fly present heading.' The Local Controller could have issued the RV7 traffic and told the C152 to follow the RV; or Local Control could have put the C152 in left closed traffic. The local FBO trains a large number of foreign pilots whose first language is not English. We here at [this airport] deal with this issue every day and have many techniques to help with the problems that arise. However; events like the one I described above are not unusual and may never be able to be eradicated given the combination of English language difficulties and low-time pilots.

After the run up we obtained a clearance to fly runway heading and take off Runway 24. When we started our takeoff roll I still had not noticed any engine roughness. It wasn't until we got airborne and were approximately 300 FT above the ground when I started noticing the engine didn't sound right. It sounded like it was missing and noticed it to be struggling to maintain a normal climb rate. I immediately confirmed with my student if he noticed what I was hearing and he acknowledged the same. I then took the controls and notified ATC (Tower) that we needed an immediate landing on Runway 31; the cross runway. I decided it would be best to land that runway since I did not want to get to far from the airport and also the winds were out of the north. The Controller gave me priority right away and gave the clearance to land Runway 31.While turning the airplane towards [Runway] 31 I quickly tried to trouble shoot the issue.

This was right next to the entrance to Runway XX and in front of the run-up apron. We had noticed another Cessna 152 from our school in the run-up area but it had remained silent and motionless as we initiated our 360.As we turned on the centerline checking the downwind to Runway XX we were stunned to see the C152 zooming by in front of us; without warning or radio call and; as we were clearly engaged in a common procedure (namely our taxi 360 turn to observe potential traffic); I hit the brakes hard to make sure we would get no closer to the other aircraft that had managed to 'squeeze' by without a peep.  I immediately made a radio call and said: '[N number]; next time; use the radio.'  I was immediately hit with an answer from the CFI on board stating: 'I had you in sight; [name]; SHUT UP!'  Bear in mind that up to this point nothing had been personal as my student and I did not even know who was on board [the other aircraft]. I immediately judged that this was inappropriate and told the other young and inexperienced CFI [by name]:'Don't tell me to shut up; you XXXXX!'I regret using the last two words of this exchange but was caught in the moment with the audacity; lack of professionalism and plain ignorance of the level of danger that this new CFI had just put us through.  It had been a close call and he did not even acknowledge it.  Furthermore; we were in a procedure that would have required maybe 5 more seconds for us to move onto the runway for departure.I proceeded to perform my instructor duties uneventfully until I came back to our hangar.

I asked him what his thought process was and told him to never tell me to shut up; especially when it is a matter of SAFETY.His lack of judgment and incapacity to perceive his wrong doing is one of the reasons for this report.  Another reason is that I brought the situation up to the Chief Flight Instructor who was more concerned about my use of the word 'XXXXX' on the radio than the REAL ISSUE; namely; SAFETY!  I could not believe this denial.This was the second event within five days where I witnessed a total lack of radio communication from two different newly minted CFIs.  I wish to establish a record with this report that I have witnessed a lack of correct radio procedure on the ground and in the air; as well as a TOTAL lack of response from the Chief Flight Instructor in the evaluation of current practices.To add insult to injury; the same Chief Flight Instructor played games with my student who happens to be a Commercially Rated Helicopter Pilot (Army retired) with over 2;000 (two-thousand hours).  When the student reported the facts to the Chief Flight Instructor he was met with sarcasm and deflection of the main topic of safety entirely.  According to the student; if someone had acted like the Chief Flight Instructor did while in the military he would have been put on some kind of notice for as much as six months for endangering lives on the ground.Lessons learned from this for me: I will try not to use expletives even if I am flustered by the actions; unaccountability; or rudeness of others.  My mistake was to allow the CFI and 'Management' to deflect from the real issues at stake here: safety in a training environment and correct radio usage. I have also learned to recognize the signs of complacency and 'boys club mentality' that are detrimental to overall safety and good cohesion of instructors.I will continue; however; to call out any unsafe practices that I witness and lead by example as I know more and more that students will 'mimic' their instructors when soloing and therefore; instructors have to hold themselves to the highest standards possible; especially while instructing.",,,,"A close encounter between two C152s; visually clearing the pattern prior to takeoff; resulted in a testosterone fueled radio exchange between the flight instructors aboard each aircraft.

We were returning to BFI; which is much busier than the airport where I received my primary training. I was more nervous than normal on the flight due to the passenger. About 20 minutes before arrival; my passenger informed me they were hungry and wished to expedite our return. Wanting to keep my passenger happy; I increased my airspeed. This definitely distracted me from me during a critical phase of flight.When I was about 4 miles away from the airport; I was given clearance to land; and was told there would be a departing B787; and 'Caution Wake Turbulence'. After acknowledging the clearance; I wondered when exactly the B787 would be departing or had departed. I called BFI Tower back; who simply told me there would be a departing 787 from the parallel runway; but didn't tell me when exactly it was/had departed.At that point; I considered asking for a 360 for spacing; but I decided not to; primarily because I didn't want to cause trouble to the Controller or other aircraft. I also didn't want to upset my passenger [who] was eager to get back; and didn't want to seem nervous about the wake turbulence. At this point; I was about 2 miles away; and didn't see the aircraft; and hoped it already had departed.When I turned base; I saw the B787 on its takeoff roll on the parallel runway. Due to the runway design; I knew its rotation point on the longer runway would be very close to my touchdown point. In retrospect; I should have considered that the light crosswind (about 3 knots towards my runway) would make a wake turbulence encounter more likely. I didn't consider going around.I steepened my approach angle and increased my airspeed slightly in case of an encounter. By the time I was on a 3/4 mile final; I estimate the B787 had departed approximately 1 minute before. When I was about 400 FT AGL I experienced a sudden left roll and downward pitch; and immediately applied opposite aileron. I estimate the maximum roll was about 30 degrees to the left. The sudden roll forced me off centerline; towards the parallel runway. I then immediately began a go-around. Although I was quite shaken; I landed uneventfully. In my opinion; my inexperience was a major factor in this incident. I am a very new private pilot (less than a month). Although I learned about wake turbulence during my primary training; I never actually experienced a situation where wake turbulence might be a factor. I don't think I understood the danger it posed. My inexperience also made me reluctant to request additional spacing from ATC; even though at the time I knew it was a good idea. The passenger wanting to return also made me reluctant to delay. I also wish my primary training had placed more emphasis on situations where it is appropriate to be more assertive with ATC to achieve higher safety. I also think my primary training should have emphasized practical wake turbulence avoidance more; especially since I operated at an airport where wake turbulence was never an issue.Although the fault was primarily mine; I think the Controller could have assisted by providing more information about when the aircraft would be departing; and asked if I wished to conduct a 360 or other spacing maneuver.",,,,"C152 pilot reported encountering wake turbulence at 400 FT AGL from a B787 departing on a parallel runway.",

After 7 laps in the pattern; I decided to depart and rolled to the turnaround area at the end of runway XX which I had used largely for the sake of convenience as wind was calm.  I had set my altimeter so that field elevation read 1000 feet for practice; so I made a takeoff call and tuned AWOS.  Unable to hear the AWOS broadcast; I set the altimeter to read field elevation; checked for traffic; and took off runway XY; having forgotten to tune the CTAF.  After no more than 100 feet of climbing; I noticed the AWOS on the radio and failed to realize I should be on CTAF.  Shortly after that I noticed another airplane (I was not able to identify it but it looked like a C172/C182) on short final; very close to myself and flying nearly a collision course.  I initiated an evasive right turn and continued to my home base without making any further communications on the CTAF. I had not heard any radio communications; but 122.9 had been quite busy all day; so it is quite possible I missed one.  One factor in this is that I had been talking with my passenger for much of the flight and not paying close attention to the radio calls being made.  I believe the other aircraft had made a straight-in; as I did not see it when looking for traffic and I would have expected to hear radio calls in the pattern prior to having tuned the AWOS frequency; but it is possible I had simply not seen it and not heard radio calls due to my lack of attention or being on the wrong frequency. To prevent recurrence; I will be checking radio frequencies prior to takeoff; limiting conversation when in the pattern and paying more attention to radio traffic in general; ensuring that I announce my departure only when fully ready to take off; and recommending other pilots do likewise.",,,,"C152 pilot reports a NMAC shortly after takeoff with an opposite direction Cessna.

The visibility was in excess of 50 miles; the sky was clear; and the winds were very light; I believe less than 10 kts and less than 30 degrees off the centerline of runway 31. I believe that these excellent conditions led to a higher than normal amount of traffic in the area; as we had previously seen numerous airplanes in the practice area. The student was pre-solo and so I was doing most of the radio work and spotting traffic. Runway 31 was active. Numerous aircraft were in the pattern; probably 5 or more. We were on right downwind; runway 31. Right-hand traffic patterns are typical for runway 31 at Palo Alto. We were cleared to land (I think #3) behind a first 172 which was on the left downwind. I had difficulty spotting it and eventually saw what I thought was the traffic to follow. Typically; when the pattern is that crowded; the controller will call one's base to control the spacing. However; on this day; the controller was not doing so. Maintaining appropriate distance from the 172 I had spotted; I instructed the student to turn base. At this point we were over Shoreline Amphitheater; which is a very long final for runway 31. After turning right base; the controller shouted at us to turn left. I immediately took the controls and turned 90 degrees to the left. As I turned; I could see a second Cessna 172 just above us headed in the opposite direction. The Cessna was either on a left base or on an instrument approach to the same runway. The aircraft passed within 50 vertical feet of us and passed directly above us. We flew through its wake; and it caused the wings of our airplane to rock; probably 20 degrees of bank in each direction. I completed what was essentially a 270 degree turn and joined final for runway 31. The controller asked us if we were #1 or #2. I could see the second 172 immediately ahead of us and I responded that we were #2. However; the pilot of the second 172 responded that they were in fact #2 and gave the controller the sequence of airplanes on final. The pilot gave the N number of the 172 on short final (which was the first 172 that I had spotted when I was on downwind); stated that his N number was #2; and stated that I was #3. The first 172 landed. The second 172 asked the controller if they were cleared to land. The controller replied that the second 172 was cleared to land. At this point; we flew through the wake of the second 172 again; and again experienced our wings rocking to each side by about 20 degrees of bank. This was at approximately 400-500 feet AGL. There was negligible loss of altitude or airspeed and as an aerobatic pilot I did not feel that this particular incidence of wake turbulence was dangerous. However; it was not pleasant to experience. The second 172 landed and was rolling out. We were on short final and it became clear that the second 172 was not going to clear the runway in time. At approximately 100-200 feet AGL; I asked the controller if we were cleared to land. The controller replied by instructing us to go around and offset to the right; which is a typical go-around instruction at Palo Alto. We completed a right-hand traffic pattern. The controller called our base turn; and we landed without incident. I did not see the second 172 until it passed over us. I was not even aware there was a second 172 in the pattern; although this was the 172 we were supposed to follow. I believe that the contributing factors were several. First and foremost; the controller was not actively maintaining spacing between aircraft in the pattern by calling base turns. Second; there was a lack of awareness; certainly on my part; but perhaps also on the controller's part; as to exactly how many 172's were in the pattern. I say that the controller may not have been aware; since first; this near miss happened; and second; after it happened; he asked if we were #1 or #2; when in fact we were #3 behind 2 172's. This near miss possibly could have been prevented if I had clarified exactly who we were following and where they were; but it definitely would have been prevented had the controller followed the typical practice (at least at Palo Alto) of actively controlling spacing by calling base turns.Furthermore; the wake turbulence was disturbing. In retrospect; probably the best course of action in this regard would have been to go around far earlier. I did not expect to experience anything at all from the wake of a 172; it being a fairly light airplane. It is likely that the controller did not either; since the controller did not provide any such warnings and did not instruct us to go around until it was obvious that the second 172 was not going to clear the runway in time. All of us were slightly shaken up; including the controllers. I say this because both I and the second 172 had to ask for clearance to land on short final; and the second 172 pilot had to give the controllers the sequence of airplanes in the pattern. I am very grateful to the controller who instructed me to turn left. That was exactly the correct instruction. That put me heading away from the second 172. However; had I been 50 feet higher; we would have had a direct head-on collision regardless. The instruction would not have been in time to prevent a collision; as we passed directly under the second 172 with no horizontal clearance. The situation was avoidable. In addition to more emphasis on active control of aircraft spacing and providing better awareness of the number of airplanes in the pattern; perhaps training for controllers on dealing with the 120 seconds after a near miss would be beneficial.",,,,"A C-152 Instructor and his student on base leg for landing took prompt evasive action and avoided a C-172 that was flying on final.

I was monitoring my student; and looking for traffic on approach to Runway 24.  Our downwind leg was approximately 2/3 of a mile south of Runway 24 and parallel.  That put our position less than 1/4 mile from the approach end of Runway 31.  At approximately midfield in the left downwind; my student (a Russian national) began screaming unintelligibly and gesticulating.  In trying to determine what he was yelling about; I looked at him and saw an aircraft slightly above our altitude and in our 8 o'clock position flying directly away from us.  We had not made any evasive actions. Upon landing; I spoke with another instructor who had witnessed the incident from the ground; and thought the aircraft passed within 20 feet of each other.  The other instructor also indicated that the other aircraft had banked to avoid our aircraft.  I contacted ATC to obtain the aircraft's tail number for this report. The flight school I work for is located at KABE. I am familiar with most of the training aircraft by tail number from both; our school and the local flying club; as well as the flight school at neighboring KXLL.  The tail number was unfamiliar to me; and likely visiting for practice instrument approach training.  I have made a number of practice approaches to every runway at KABE; both as student and instructor.  When Runway 13-31 closed for construction; only RNAV approaches became available for those runways.  Thus; low approaches became the norm; even during times of significant flight operations out of the passenger terminal; the private hangars; and the general aviation hangars.  I firmly believe that a practice instrument approach in VMC with an altitude restriction should also clarify when the climb should be initiated on the miss.

We entered the airport environment at 3;000 and 5 miles and made a radio call stating our intentions to land Rwy 34 while reporting our position in miles from the airport and altitude. Abeam the airport and to the west by about 4 miles we had reached TPA of 1200 feet. Making another radio call and stating our intentions to make a 45 degree entry to the downwind for RWY 34. Not soon after we heard a call from a Piper Chieftan reporting that they were over island crossing (a common reporting point for the airport) and were entering a 45 to the downwind for RWY 34. Then a particularly excited call came from another Cessna in the area saying that he also was over island crossing and did not have the Chieftan in sight. The Chieftan then proceeded to announce that he wasn't actually over island crossing; but was actually over the casino. The problem here is the Chieftan pilot did not once state his position in relation to the airport or altitude and there just so happens to be two large Casinos in the area. I assumed the Chieftan pilot was over the casino located southwest of the field (behind us) when in fact he was North of the field. This is where I should have queried the Chieftan pilot to specify his position in direction and distance from the airport. My student and I reported island crossing and entered the 45 to the downwind for RWY 34 number 2 to land and my student sights the Chieftan to our 9 o'clock and I take the controls and alter course to my right as does the Chieftan driver. Passing to our left and behind us at about 200 feet and same altitude. I learned how important good radio calls are and let it be a lesson for my student. In the future I will be more pro-active and question others to give more precise position reports.",,,,"C152 instructor pilot entering the traffic pattern experiences a NMAC with a PA31 also entering the traffic pattern after having made an inaccurate position report.",

This type of airplane normally cruises around 2400 or 2500 RPM and any variation is abnormal.  As the instructor pilot and PIC; I normally check the mixture setting in case of engine roughness to help correct any mistake by the pilot flying.  The mixture had been set for peak RPM at 3;000 MSL and again at top of climb.  Adjusting the mixture to a more rich setting did not help; and the surges slowly increased with periodic power losses of 300 RPM.  Turning on the carburetor heat seemed to have no effect other than the usual 100 RPM decrease in power.  The full rich mixture setting seemed to help slightly; but the surges continued. I evaluated precautionary landing locations and decided that any course deviation would take us away from the only nearby fields that were clear of trees and water.  The closest suitable airports were beyond power off range.  I considered reporting to ATC but the frequency was too busy to spend any time waiting to get a word in edgewise.  I decided I would need to change the transponder code if we attempted a landing. I performed a configuration flow to verify fuel and ignition settings.  Further adjustments to the engine controls led to a power loss of more than 1;000 RPM.  Immediately applying carburetor heat restored most of the power.  After this; when I turned off the carburetor heat; the engine nearly shut down again after a few seconds.  This happened two or three times; which seemed to confirm we had an induction problem rather than a fuel problem or random surging.  After that; I left the carburetor heat on; moved the throttle fully forward; and reset the mixture control to peak RPM to try to increase the temperature.  I also pulled firmly on the carburetor heat control for a few minutes because these controls have a tendency to slide in and sometimes seem to work better when pulled beyond the normal range of movement. The engine surging stopped with full carburetor heat.  We had nearly full power and had lost only 100 feet of altitude.  I tried reporting to ATC at that point and did not get a response until the second or third attempt.  I advised that we were experiencing carburetor icing and seemed to have it under control. After several minutes; I turned off the carburetor heat and we were able to continue the flight with full power restored.  I ensured the carburetor heat was turned back on before each change to the throttle setting. Closer to our destination; I monitored our ETA carefully because we were within 0.2 hours of the minimum fuel requirement; based on preflight visual inspection with a fuel gauge; the airplane's hour meter; and performance tables in the flight manual.  When we were handed off to the tower frequency; I calculated that we would land with exactly 0.5 hours fuel remaining; and I reported 'minimum fuel' on our initial call to the tower.  At the time; the left fuel gauge indicated empty; and the right fuel gauge indicated more than 1 hour fuel remaining.  The landing was uneventful.  Upon parking we found the left tank had no measurable fuel; and the right tank had 10 minutes of usable fuel. On the return flight; I added 7% to the fuel flow rate calculation which proved to be accurate; and there were no further problems. Contributing to the multiple near-shutdowns of the engine on this flight were lack of safety equipment; instrumentation; and accurate operational information.  The airplane was not equipped with injection type induction; carburetor ice detection; engine gas temperature indication; fuel flow rate indication; or a fuel totalizer.  As a result; there was no early warning of the induction problem or potential icing conditions; no way to precisely set the mixture or to achieve peak EGT for carburetor heating; no indication of higher than normal fuel flow; and no way to accurately measure fuel remaining while in flight. The airplane's manual contains a carburetor icing emergency procedure that was inadequate to prepare me for this situation.  It simply says; 'A gradual loss of RPM and eventual engine roughness may result from the formation of carburetor ice.  To clear the ice; apply full throttle and pull the carburetor heat knob full out until the engine runs smoothly.'  In this situation; the engine's surging and abrupt loss of RPM did not fit the description of a gradual power loss. Contributing to the delay in communicating safety-critical information to ATC were frequency congestion; having only one radio installed in the airplane; and both pilots being task saturated to prevent an unsafe engine failure. Human performance was optimal in this situation.  Workload management was handled correctly with task delegation and prioritization.  Risk management techniques were applied correctly; although I need to re-evaluate fuel management risks in the Aircraft category of the PAVE checklist.",,,,"C152 instructor pilot reported dealing with a rough running engine that finally responded to carburetor heat.",

I was listening to other aircraft in the pattern at a nearby airport; but no other airplanes were reporting in the pattern at KMAN. Winds were light; favoring 11 slightly.

As I turned base; another airplane entered the runway and departed on 11. I continued onto final and landed. As I was approaching the taxiway exit; a low wing aircraft flew over the top of me; taking off from the opposite end of the runway.

At the time I was acting as a student gaining proficiency in the aircraft and learning proper technique for cross wind landings. The wind was variable at 150 to 190 at 12 knots. I had control of the aircraft on final and landed the aircraft in the two point configuration on the first 1/3 of the runway. By approximately 2/3 down the runway the aircraft was ready to transition to a three point configuration from the two point wheel landing configuration it initially contacted the runway in. While allowing the tail to lower to the ground; the aircraft began to yaw to the right into the wind. At the moment the aircraft began to yaw; I did not feel comfortable or confident in my ability to react to the yawing and verbalized 'you have the flight controls' to my instructor. This was the process in which we had briefed previous to the flight of how command of the flight controls would be transferred should either of us feel unsafe or uncomfortable. Once verifying the instructor had control of the aircraft; I let go of the controls and placed my feet flat on the floor off of the rudder pedals. At this moment; the instructor took control of the aircraft and accepted the role and responsibility of pilot in command. The instructor successfully stopped the rotation of the aircraft; keeping the aircraft on the runway. However; shortly after the instructor corrected the aircraft; the aircraft pitched over onto its nose and slid approximately 4 feet to a stop.

Aircraft was beyond gliding distance to the runway so made a 20 degree right turn and landed on a paved road located just to the right of extended runway center line.

I noticed that the 'Fluid' from the right wing wasn't proper color but attributed this to auto fuel that had been used previously. Smelled the 'fluid' and it had the odor of Auto fuel. Obviously; when I drained the fuel sampler; I didn't notice any water droplets remaining in the sampler. I did notice on the gascolator that the fuel was blue but still had an auto fuel odor. Oddly enough; when I drained the left tank; I intentionally caught water dripping off the flap to show the students what water looked like in a fuel sampler.  Lesson learned: If it ain't BLUE; don't fly. I never liked auto fuel in aircraft anyway.

Applicant thought he was not going to make it and was approaching 'Alpha' Taxiway on Runway 19 when Tower or Ground gave a Cessna; looked like a C172; permission to cross 19 just less than 200-300 feet in front of us. I was afraid we would collide with the C172. Focusing on the current situation; before I could take over; the applicant pushed in the power and made a 90-100 degree turn to the right to exit the runway as instructed. By that time I told the applicant 'What are you doing?' and told him 'My controls'. I exited the runway as quickly as possible so as to avoid any other problems. The aircraft that was behind us landing was instructed to go-around. I saw that aircraft as I exited the runway. He was on a 1/2 mile final. We never turn 180 degrees in the opposite direction of traffic. Why did tower or ground instruct the C172 that was southeast bound on 'Alpha' to cross Runway 19 while we were still on the runway decelerating? Why couldn't Tower tell him to wait? The Tower; in communicating the instructions to the pilot were vague! When we landed he said that traffic will cross downfield. What traffic? The C172 was holding short of Runway 19 on 'Alpha' and then he raced across Runway 19 as we were still on the runway only 200-300 feet from him. The Tower trains controllers all year round with heavy flight school activity and massive corporate traffic. Just recently I have been giving flight tests out of FRG airport and find it very difficult to administer check rides in such a hectic environment. Most of their instructions are very vague. Also any pilot who does not understand the instructions should ask Tower to read back or ask for a 'Progressive'.",,,,"C152 Instructor questioned several ATC procedures at FRG airport.",

Controller 1's instructed us to report a 3 mile final for runway 24. Shortly after another aircraft; an Archer called and said he was over Sky Acres (44N); which was roughly our position; for landing as well. Controller 1 asked him to report a left base for runway 24 and we were asked to ident; I replied 'negative transponder;' Controller 1 then reported us to the Archer andporting three mile final the male controller gave us landing clearance; which the student read back. On very short final Controller 2 came on the frequency and said 'Archer s-turns approved;' I heard no request for s-turns or reply from the Archer. We touched down on runway 24 before taxiway B and began our landing roll. While crossing runway 15/33 Controller 1 instructed us to turn left on taxiway E without delay for traffic on short final. We read back the instructions and proceeded down the runway without braking; once clear of 15/33; while still on the landing roll on runway 24 and before turning onto taxiway E (between 15/33 and taxiway E on runway 24) I looked behind us to see the Archer in the flare and touching down for landing on 24; the same runway we were positioned on. Turning on taxiway E we applied almost full power to attempt to clear the runway but we were still well inside of the hold short line (still on the runway side) when the Archer rolled past us on 24. A collision would have been inevitable if we had been unable to clear the runway for an unexpected reason; such as a flat tire; or if we had attempted to stop at an earlier taxiway before instructed to take taxiway E; causing a delay; or if we had a slower approach or the Archer had a faster approach and the separation distance was smaller. As the Archer rolled past us on 24 Controller 1 instructed them to make the right turn on taxiway G and to taxi to Juliet on the tower frequency; and then Controller 2 said 'sorry about that; training in progress.' We then proceeded to taxi to the terminal via taxiway E with a clearance from the ground control frequency. The main cause of this near miss is the failure of the Archer to execute a go-around with traffic still on the runway; which was caused by a combination of failing to see traffic on the runway as a possible conflict; and the controller not calling a go-around after clearing the Archer for landing with very little separation. Contributing to the situation that lead to the near miss was not having an operable transponder [in our aircraft]; although it is not required in the airspace the aircraft was in; sequencing a slower aircraft before a faster aircraft from a similar position relative to the airport; not informing the aircraft in front of the faster aircraft of the proximity of the second aircraft; distraction of the controller by the Skyhawk from the north making requests and distractions to the controller resulting from the training they were doing. The only environmental factor that may have had an effect was the sun in the west potentially making it difficult for the pilot of the Archer to see traffic ahead of them.",,,,"c152 Instructor Pilot was surprised that another aircraft was allowed to land so close behind them that it could have resulted in a ground collision had they been slower exiting the runway.",

The traffic pattern was very busy for both runways at DVT and we had made several landings all as touch and goes. We were operating off the north runway landing and departing from 7L. After several landings I took control of the aircraft on the runway and made the take off with the intent of demonstrating another pattern and wheel landing to my student. I was seated on the right side and our patterns were left traffic each time for 7L. As we lifted off the runway; tower instructed us that traffic was inbound from northeast of the field and told us to extend our upwind until we had him in sight. The student; who is an ATP; spotted the traffic to our left; entering the downwind; and told me I was clear to start the crosswind turn. I could not see the traffic myself; due to the climb angle and being seated on the right side. As I rolled out on crosswind the tower said to turn back to the right due to the traffic ahead. I rolled back to the upwind. Again my student called out the traffic and said we would be good to turn. We notified tower and were cleared to turn while maintaining our own separation. Once again I began a turn to the crosswind and the tower again told us to turn back to the upwind for traffic ahead. As I turned back to the upwind again; we spotted the aircraft ahead and going below us and realized we had been looking at a 3rd aircraft on the downwind. Tower commented that traffic had gone right below us and told us to turn crosswind at our discretion and follow the traffic for landing. Tower did not say anything else and we made a number of other landings before finishing the instructional flight. Several things were factors in this event. First was my over reliance on the student; who is very experienced and is someone I fly with a lot. Also; the position of the aircraft made it such that I could not see it myself during climb out from the right seat. In addition; the pattern and the frequency were extremely busy. Also; each time we would fly the pattern the number of aircraft in the pattern would change; from 1 or 2 to 3 or 4. This was a recipe for spotting the wrong airplane and getting out of sequence. Also; I am not sure the tower ever told us there was another aircraft already on downwind; but this would have helped us to know we had another aircraft that would be sequenced between us that we needed to be looking for. Due to the downwind aircraft being close to the direction of our traffic when we were told to follow; we were led into the trap of spotting the wrong airplane.This incident reminds me on how careful we have to be about relying on another pilot when spotting traffic. I am also reminded of how careful we have to be with multiple aircraft in the pattern; in order to not get out of sequence and to always ask if unsure.",,,,"C170 Instructor with student experienced an NMAC in the traffic pattern at DVT after being told to extend upwind for traffic.

I was the instructor conducting this aircraft checkout. The pilot in this report told me he converted his certificate to a U.S. PPL by visiting a FSDO office; there were no additional training or testing requirements. He has only held his U.S. PPL for 15 months.  During the checkout; the pilot informed me he had never been trained on power off stalls; power on stalls; or steep turns. He demonstrated his understanding of slow flight principles to a marginal degree; but he could not set up or recover from a stall. When it came to steep turns; he refused to bank more than 25 degrees. None of these tasks were performed anywhere close to U.S. private pilot standards.Returning to the airport from the South; the tower controller instructed us to enter a midfield left downwind to Runway 23. We were still 2 miles South of the airport and had not yet entered the pattern when the pilot descended us to an unsafe altitude of 300 feet AGL. Prior to reaching this altitude; I had been asking him to climb and return to pattern altitude. He was not responding to my requests. I finally took the controls and climbed us back to pattern altitude.  Before this low altitude issue; we had discussed that the U.S. standard traffic pattern was 1;000 AGL; which is apparently what is also used in the U.K.; according to the pilot. When he told me the standard procedure in the U.K. was to set the altimeter to read 0 feet while on the ground; I reiterated the importance of remembering to use MSL altitudes here. I reiterated the MSL pattern altitude at our airport.  300 ft AGL is 900 feet MSL at this particular airport. I am concerned that the pilot may have reverted to his U.K. procedure of descending to 1;000 feet indicated; forgetting that our altimeters are calibrated to read airport elevation when on the ground. This possibly led us to being at approximately 900 feet MSL / 300 feet AGL before I took the controls. I am concerned that this could be a more widespread issue. This scenario could have easily ended in a CFIT or other serious incident or accident. I recommend the FAA reevaluate its process for converting foreign private pilot certificates. The idea that a foreign-based private pilot can so easily obtain a U.S. PPL; despite never having been trained in major private pilot maneuvers including stalls; concerns me.",,,,"C152 instructor pilot reported his UK-trained student descended to 300 feet AGL in the pattern because of differences in altimeter setting procedures.",

A cold front had passed through the night before; and the winds aloft were from the NW at about 15-20 kts. OAT was about 0 deg C. About 20 nm West; ATC flight following gave me the surface wind as 330@5G12; but noted that the information was about an hour old. ATC terminated flight following; and I began my descent and tuned in the ASOS to hear the winds were 320@7 kts; gusting to 15 kts. Hearing no traffic on the CTAF and seeing no other traffic; I decided to land on the most favorable runway; 35. I flew a close-in left downwind on 35 to visually check the wind sock and wind-t. They both verified that the wind was generally from the North-West; so I continued the left pattern to final for runway 35. A 2 mile final is recommended to avoid overflight of housing near the airport; so I had a long stable approach to touchdown.On final; I began a slight side slip to the left to counter the left crosswind I was experiencing (and that I had expected). I continued the slip until touchdown; where I performed a wheel landing. I had rolled for maybe 1 or 2 seconds on both mains; when I suddenly was hit by a gust from the left that initiated a veer to the left. I applied full right rudder and left aileron to counter; but my control inputs were not sufficient to get back to the centerline. I applied light brakes; but got off them when the nose dipped; and relied on rudder. As I neared the left edge of the runway; the right rudder input took effect and the aircraft began a right turn. Unfortunately; I had now over controlled and the aircraft continued into a tight right turn as the tail came around with the tailwheel now on the ground. I estimate my ground speed when the ground-loop started at about 30-40 mph. As the aircraft continued the right turn; the tail wheel unlocked and the turn tightened. The right wing lifted due to centripetal force from the turn and the wind (now out of the West) also picked it up enough so that the left wing tip drug on the runway over about a 10 to 15 foot arc. The aircraft ended up heading downwind on runway 35. After taxiing to the ramp and tying down; I observed the wind gusts shifting about 60 degrees from NNW to W periodically about every 5 minutes and then returning to NW after a about a minute.

A few seconds later my instructor noticed smoke in the cabin (But I didn't); so he took over controls; did a 180 and made a short landing. After taxiing to a parking spot; I got out of the plane and my instructor ran the plane to full power; and I noticed smoke coming out the bottom of the plane. After cutting the power and the mechanic drove over; he pointed out that the engine hull was cracked; and dripping engine oil onto the exhaust; causing the smoke.Contributing factors was (according to the mechanic) probably that the engine was in warranty to 100;000 hours and it was at 130;000 hours; and the crack was due to engine fatigue.My main problem was that I didn't recognize there was anything wrong with the engine even after the plane was landed because (1) I didn't think the exhaust smell was out of place and (2) I didn't notice smoke.

I informed Approach of the situation; the nearest airport they mentioned was about 9 miles to the east. This power setting did not allow me to maintain altitude at the best glide speed of the aircraft; aircraft kept descending about 200 feet per minute. I directed the aircraft towards the road since it seemed it was the safest place to land. I followed the procedures on checklist for forced landing with engine power. Aircraft landed safe on the road. There was no property damage and no one was harmed. The aircraft was evacuated after it came to a complete stop; and after a few minutes the aircraft was pushed to the grassy area besides the road to prevent the aircraft from being damaged by local automobile traffic in the dark road. After emergency personnel left the area; I remained near the aircraft until mechanics and flight school representative arrived at the scene.

I will not be using hindsight in this report. All times and attitudes (Indicated Altitudes) are approximate. More exact times and altitudes can be obtained from the FAA recordings of radio transmissions and transponder records.My flight planning started the night before. I checked weather NOTAMs; TFRs and other pertinent information on fltplan.com. I met my passenger and reviewed the flight log for the aircraft. I reviewed the [squawks] and repair log. I checked the weather on the way to the ramp.  I followed the pre-flight checklist for the Cessna 152. The fuel gauges appeared to show that the left tank was a little more than half and the right tank was a little more than three quarters. When I checked the fuel in the tanks visually; they seem to agree with the gauges. I completed the exterior and pre-start check lists without issue.  Then I taxied to the edge of the ramp; checking the brakes on the way; and waited for Ground Control for clearance. After clearance was received; I taxied towards the runway; did a normal run up procedure near the grass area behind the hold short line. After a successful pre-flight run up; I taxied to the hold short line; informed the Tower that I was ready for takeoff and we would be an eastbound departure. The tower cleared me to take off and proceed eastbound. Once we were about 5 miles east; Tower released me and reminded me to remain clear of Class B Airspace by remaining below 1100 feet; gave me the Approach Control frequency and approved the frequency change. We remained below 1100 feet and proceeded in an easterly direction towards [destination] for lunch. I turned towards [destination] and contacted Tower for arrival instructions. [Tower] cleared me to approach and instructed me to report a 2 NM final. I maneuvered into position for the final approach and reported when we were on a 2 NM final. [Tower] cleared me to land. I continued the approach and landed. [Tower] asked for our destination on the field; I informed them we wanted to go to the restaurant. [Tower] informed me that the restaurant is permanently closed. I reported that we would be departing the airport in a northbound direction. [Tower] gave me instructions back to runway. I flew in a northerly direction; climbed to an altitude of approximately 1500 feet. I tuned to Approach and found extensive radio activity and traffic in the area. I decided to change direction to remain clear of the airspace. I turned to a westerly direction to have lunch at [a different] airport restaurant. I contacted Approach Control for VFR Flight Following and received a transponder code.A short time after; the engine started to sputter and the RPM was low. I trimmed the aircraft to best glide; checked the primer & carburetor heat; both were in a normal position. So I worked the throttle in and out to attempt to get the engine running normally again. While I was performing these actions; I informed [ATC] of the engine issues. [ATC] informed me that I was cleared for any altitude. The engine came back to life and I informed [ATC] that I decided to return to [departure airport]. At this point I had lost some altitude and [ATC] suggested [another] alternate. I reported that the engine was operating normally and we would be continuing to [departure airport]. I asked for vectors to [departure airport] and turned to that heading. Shortly after turning towards [departure airport; the engine started to sputter again and the RPM was very low again. Once again; I trimmed the aircraft to best glide; checked the primer & carburetor heat; both were in a normal position. So I worked the throttle in and out to attempt to get the engine running normally again. While I was performing these actions; I informed [ATC] of the engine issues again and informed [ATC] that I would like to head towards [a closer airport] and attempt to land. I asked [ATC] for vectors and turned to thatheading. The engine came to life again (for a second time) and I continued for a normal landing. The engine was running normally and seemed to have no symptoms of immediate failure. I informed [ATC] that I was continuing for landing.A short time later; the engine began to sputter for a third time. I performed the same actions but this time the engine came to a stop. Once I trimmed the aircraft for best glide; I attempted to restart the engine. I informed [ATC] of the engine issues again and that it had stopped. After several attempts to restart the engine; I informed [ATC] that I would not be able to land at [the alternate airport] and I would have to make an off field landing. [ATC] recommended [a highway]; just ahead of us. I let them know of the power lines and poles and that I would be landing in the open field. At this time; my altitude was approximately 1100 feet. [ATC] reported that the winds were calm.  Then [ATC] asked the questions: How much fuel is remaining and souls on board. I looked at the fuel gauges and I reported that there were about 2 hours of fuel and 2 souls. That is when I realized that the fuel gauges had not changed since the pre-flight.I proceeded in an easterly direction towards the open field; monitoring the airspeed; descending and remaining clear of the power lines; trees and [athletic] field. Once I passed over the high power lines (heading easterly) and south of the [athletic] field; I started a more aggressive descent; adjusted flaps accordingly; but still gradual in order to easily clear the trees to the south of the open field. I lined up with the tree line to the east of the open field (to my right and the [athletic] field to my left) in a northerly direction; to have the longest landing area. Once I passed to the east of the [athletic] field and over the open field; I began the final approach and turned the master off and we opened the doors slightly. I began to bleed off airspeed by pitching to a high angle of attack and began floating in ground effect. Keeping the nose gear high; I touched down in the open field north and east of the [athletic] field and did not use the brakes; at this point; because I felt it would cause the nose wheel to impact the field and cause a tumbling effect. I held the nose gear up until it came down gently and smoothly. Then I applied the toe brakes and came to a stop at the north west corner of the open field.",,,,"C152 pilot reported landing in a field after the engine quit because of fuel starvation.",

This creates a potentially dangerous situation in which an aircraft which had requested flight following is not being provided with those services.As a matter of standard practice; TRACON terminates Radar services to VFR aircraft when they near the boundary instead of handing the aircraft off to TRACON. This occurs even when Tower has done the extra work of entering a Center flight plan; alleviating that work from TRACON.Unless an aircraft requests termination of flight following; hand-offs should be performed for all aircraft so they are not denied the VFR flight following services they request.

I had the student do an overhead recon to [a nearby field]. As we crossed over mid-field on the grass runway; the student entered a left down-wind pattern to land to the northeast. The runway was on his side (left) of the aircraft as we maneuvered.The student crossed the tree-lined river that borders the southwest end of the strip on airspeed and slightly high with sufficient runway to stop. After touchdown on the main gear and while rolling out I observed an area of high grass (the rest of the strip appeared to have been recently mowed) about 100-200 feet in front of us with a narrow path mowed around the high grass to the left.I had not been able to observe the high grass as we flew overhead due to my position in the right seat. I started to steer the aircraft toward the mowed pathway but entered the tall grass and we immediately began to decelerate. I took control of the aircraft; applied full aft yoke to hold the tail down and full throttle; trying to power out of the tall grass to the mowed area beyond. The aircraft came to a stop in a tail-high attitude with the nose resting on the ground. After completing the shutdown of the aircraft; we exited to find ourselves in deep mud as the high grass was a very wet swampy area. There was no markings such as tape or signs or any barriers to denote the hazardous condition of that part of the runway.In retrospect; I should have had the student position the aircraft as we did the overhead recon so that I would have been able to view the entire runway to evaluate its condition. I feel the airstrip owner bears some responsibility for not having marked the hazardous part of the runway.

When we were [in cruise] RPM started to fluctuate. We used Carb Heat because we suspected we picked up carb ice. But RPM kept fluctuating and carb heat didn't fix the problem. We flew [quite a distance; but] kept losing Altitude very slowly. We had notified ATC that we had carb ice and needed to land ASAP but didn't [announce an] emergency. We wanted to believe it was carb ice. [After landing] we waited about 2 hours searching for some carb ice and carb heat information online. There's no information that carb ice never melt for 20-30 minutes after applying carb heat. We did very thorough run up check and checked carb heat for few times on the ground before [departing again]. We took off and we were hoping that nothing happens this time. And used carb heat all the time when we were cruising. We leaned mixture properly. Rpm started to fluctuate again. Dropped down to 1400-1500 even we set 2500 RPM. We were using carb heat before any rpm stoppage of engine roughness. I had to decide either continue or go back to [departure airport]. I didn't want to take chance and [notified] ATC of our problem and [returned to departure airport]. I tried to lose minimum altitude but we couldn't maintain altitude and glided. There was a runway we could see straight in but tower asked us to join left downwind for runway 15 even though I have told him I cannot maintain altitude. I have told him again; he ignored and tower controller gave jet planes clearance for takeoff and then finally he said clear to land. When we tried to turn base he said cancel landing clearance extend downwind. We had no option at the lower altitude. What if we extend downwind and engine suddenly quit we cannot make back to runway. I [notified ATC of] emergency [situation] and landed airplane on runway 15. So here's what I want to know. I want to make sure what was the cause of rpm drop; it was almost full power mixture was properly leaned. Outside temperature was about 30 degree. It's rental plane they just say its carb ice. Then why carb heat didn't fix the problem for 20-30minutes. Why tower controller just ignored me and took care of IFR departure traffics. I notified him 3 times that I can't maintain altitude.

Prior to take off; I saw there was a maintenance block on that aircraft on schedule and maintenance squawk sheet showed 'radio'. I went ahead to ask the school maintenance to verify that everything was okay for that aircraft. At the same time; I did my pre-flight inspection. The maintenance told me that everything was checked accordingly and there was nothing abnormal for that aircraft. Therefore; I followed the 152 checklist from pre-flight all the way to run-up. During my run-up; I checked everything and followed the checklist including RPM/Radio and everything was looking okay and the radio was okay that I was able to contact the school line service for fuel and able to contact ZZZ ground and tower. To make sure that this aircraft is safe for flight; I requested the tower for west departure that I would like to do some test run at west practice area before landing away from different airport. Everything was okay until I climbed up to 3000 feet that I was trying to lean the airplane mixture. I found out a different problem with this aircraft that the RPM kept showing 2500 even I tried to put more lean on the mixture and reduced the power. At the same time; I spot that airspeed was showing something abnormal that I just slightly reduced my angle of my flight and the airspeed showed from 90 knots to 120 knots in yellow arc. At that moment; I knew that there was something wrong with that aircraft. Therefore; I decided to return to the ZZZ airport and my intention was to abort my flight at this time. I felt not safe to continue with this flight. While heading back to the airport; I constantly made radio calls at west practice area to let others know my position and attitude.

I called out my position on the upwind; crosswind; and downwind legs on the CTAF frequency 122.7. Turning onto my downwind leg; I was flying at the TPA [traffic pattern altitude] of 1;117 and noticed an aircraft entering a 45 to right downwind to RWY 20; but flying abnormally wide and high (I estimate at around 1;500 ft). I again announced that I was established on the downwind leg. At this point; the aircraft turned right; making a right base to RWY 20; and began a descent with a direct intercept towards my aircraft. I announced on CTAF that their right turn towards me was creating a potential collision as they were turning and descending into me. I began an avoidance turn to the right so as to avoid a collision and again called out on the radio that their maneuver was placing both aircraft in danger. At this point the aircraft made a level left turn. I estimate both aircraft came within 95 feet of each other.

The pilot of the Saratoga was making radio calls to enter the pattern on a straight in for Runway 03. I inquired about him coming in for a straight in from the north and told him we were on crosswind for runway 03. I then spotted the Saratoga coming in from the north; offset from what would be a straight-in for runway 21 and he appeared to be on the extended downwind [upwind?] leg for Runway 03 at the time.

Upon reaching the vicinity of the airport we were cleared for the option on Runway XX and then to proceed VFR North to our destination being ZZZ1. The intention was to do a stop and go into ZZZ and head to ZZZ1 as we had full fuel before departing. I noticed during the landing we were starting to get slow so I informed her to add power and push the nose down but stayed off of the controls. She did as I had said and we started to build airspeed again but the nose down was a little too excessive. As we were getting closer to the ground I noticed she wasn't pulling back for a type of round out or flare so I grabbed the controls and pulled back. We had a significant amount of airspeed and hit the ground on all three wheels and bounced multiple times on the runway. Three to four of the bounces were harder ones where we actually became slightly airborne before returning to the ground. After those bounces we preceded to have tiny bounces for a few seconds before coming to a full stop. Upon stopping ZZZ tower over the radio and asked if we needed any assistance. I responded and said I would need to look at the outside of the plane before taking back off. He cleared us to stay where we were on the runway so I had her check her tire on the left and I checked mine on the right. I then proceeded with the prop still running to get out and check the nose wheel. Everything appeared fine with the nose wheel so I got back inside and checked all the engine indications and everything was reading normal. While all that was going on ZZZ had a mobile aid truck driving out behind us on the runway to look for type Foreign Object Debris. I called tower when I got back in the plane and told them we were okay to depart and that I hadn't noticed anything. They waited for the truck to report back that there was no debris and for them to get off the runway then cleared us for takeoff. At no time during the entire event did I feel like the prop struck the ground or had the opportunity to strike as the nose wasn't in my mind close to the ground. We took off of Runway XX and started to head toward ZZZ1. I continuously monitored the gauges and was listening for any abnormalities and didn't notice anything. We landed Runway YY at ZZZ1 and I was on the controls with her the entire time. Once the nose wheel touched the ground after the mains it began to violently shake so we applied as much back pressure as possible to relieve the nose wheel. We taxied like that to the fuel pumps at ZZZ1 where I got out and looked over the plane. The very first thing I noticed was the prop bent aft and I immediately knew maintenance would be required. I then inspected the nose wheel and the alignment was a little off to the right side if you're looking at the plane head on. I'm not sure if the alignment became off when we took off from ZZZ or when we landed in ZZZ1 but if I would've noticed I would not have departed ZZZ. ZZZ1 maintenance came out and looked at the plane for us and that when I called Dispatch to talk to our maintenance and a chief instructor.",,,,"C152 instructor pilot reported the student failed to flare for the landing resulting in a prop strike and some damage to the nose gear.",

The nearest airport was ZZZ and I made decision to land there. Center was providing VFR flight following and was notified of my situation. The procedure of verifying the correct engine control positions failed to increase RPM. The remaining engine output was sufficient to maintain altitude; but I judged it to be unreliable and opted to not reduce power for fear it would cause further undesirable operation. I was cleared to switch to CTAF and announced my intentions to land on the active runway. After slipping to lose excess altitude it became apparent a helicopter was on the end of the runway. I requested that he please move with no response.Unsure of the planes ability to climb on a go around I decided to land on the parallel taxiway that was clear of traffic and obstruction. I made an announcement on CTAF that we would land on the taxiway. Unsure of the helicopter on the runways intentions; I asked he depart to the right and away from the taxiway. A slightly faster than normal landing was made without aircraft damage. Contacting CTAF was delayed by a few seconds because we did not have the CTAF frequency being unfamiliar with the airport. My passenger another pilot was trying to tune it while I controlled and looked for the airport and possible alternative landing sites. This delay might have caused the near conflict on the runway. The solution of landing at the nearest airport was complicated by lack of time to communicate with traffic in the area and the only clear landing spot was the taxiway.",,,,"A general aviation pilot reported having an issue with his aircraft's engine; which prompted the pilot to divert to an enroute field.

Tower instructed me to hold short for landing traffic; which I read back and complied with. The frequency seemed busier than normal so I made sure to keep my radio verbiage concise and minimal so as not to clutter an already busy frequency.A few moments later the traffic had landed and I expected to hear a call from tower telling me I was cleared for takeoff. A couple minutes had passed and this being a busy airport; a sizeable line of 5 or 6 aircraft had lined up behind me all waiting for their turn. I thought it was odd that I would be holding short for so long but figured there must still be some traffic landing and sure enough; as if to confirm my thoughts; another aircraft landed. The lineup of aircraft behind me grew larger and larger.Now; absolutely certain that I would be getting takeoff clearance any second I took one last glance at my checklist to double check that I was good to go. Then out of the corner of my eye I see another Cessna trying to squeeze between my aircraft and edge of the taxiway from behind. The passenger in the other aircraft was gesturing wildly and seemingly pointing to their own headset trying to get my attention.At that moment I turned my head further to the right and all of the sudden my headset came alive with the loud sound of radio chatter. The tower was instructing aircraft to try and fit between myself and the edge of the taxiway. At that moment I realized there was something wrong with my radio. I keyed up my mike; asked for a radio check; and then coordinated with tower to do a 180 on the taxiway so as to move back into the run-up area and let the now long line of aircraft pass by me. Sitting in the run-up I started troubleshooting my radio and couldn't find a single thing wrong. Then; I moved my knee to rest against the center panel where the trim wheel and radio jacks were. All of the sudden my radio went silent again. My knee had moved the plastic panel in such a way as to push my headset plugs slightly out of their jacks. Relieved that the problem was a simple fix; I tightened the headset jacks; called up tower and advised that I had sorted out my radio problem and was ready to go. Tower subsequently cleared me for takeoff and I read back the clearance and thanked them for their patience. While being NORDO holding short of the runway I had missed a handful of clearances from the tower. Other pilots had advised me later that I missed a 'line up and wait' instruction as well as numerous attempts to get my attention. Going forward I will be cautious of an eerily silent radio frequency especially at a towered airport and will double check my radio and headset connections. I will also try to maintain better situational awareness; as I'm sure there must have been more clues to inform me of my communication issues.",,,,"C152 pilot reported communication problems with the tower while holding for takeoff.",

It was not a hard landing at all; no bouncing or porpoising; but it was sideways of the centerline. When we did touch down; with the nose wheel left of centerline; I did not want to add right rudder due to us having a speed of around 50 knots and the winds coming from the left.

We were in the traffic pattern for about 30 minutes when one plane started taxiing to the run-up area; a Cirrus (SR22). Another airplane was taxiing from the east ramp to the hold-short line of runway XX; it was an experimental airplane. There was one airplane that took off when we were turning left downwind to left base runway XX; it was a low wing aircraft. When we turned final for runway XX the Cirrus was doing the run-up; the experimental was holding short of runway XX; and the other aircraft that departed runway XX was not insight. We were approaching runway XX and everything seems to be okay. We were on short final and my student started his flare; about 5-10 feet from the runway we realized there was another aircraft coming from the opposite direction of the runway. At that point we were already touching down so I took the controls as fast as I could and just moved the airplane to the right because I saw the other airplane moving to the left. Once we passed each other I said on the CTAF: 'What was that about?' No response for about 30-40 seconds and then a guy said: 'Sorry; we got an engine failure'. I wasn't very sure what happened because the aircraft was taxiing like a normal airplane and the engine was running. There was no injuries or damage to any of the airplanes. I told my student that it was enough practice for today so we taxied to the ramp and parked the airplane. We talked to the FBO line guys about what happened and one them said that one of the guys in the airplane said they had an engine failure so I asked: 'how is that possible if they were taxiing with the engine running' but the line guy didn't know the answer.

I have flown this C170 many times in past just myself as well as with 3 friends aboard and it became my favorite aircraft. Unfortunately; lately; this plane has ongoing electrical problems with generator and regulator. After some time the circuit breaker trips and system is not charging anymore. I had to return twice before due to same failure which the mechanics fixed; but the problem kept reappearing after a while. During this particular flight yesterday; I have decided to abort my flight because of same electrical failure due to the defective charging system. As I was returning back to departure airport; I was worrying that I will lose my radio before I arrive back. I was given clearance to land on Runway XXR. The wind conditions were variable as the windsock was not moving at all and then suddenly kept getting strong gusts from various directions. At the end of the flare; just before touchdown; sudden strong gust of crosswind from west threw my tail off so hard that I did not have sufficient rudder authority to compensate. I immediately applied full power to abort the landing and tried to go around. Unfortunately; I did not have time to push back the carb heat nor retract my full flaps which limited my engine power and kept high drag. This resulted in me being still just few feet above the ground and aiming diagonally across the grass to runway XXL; which was free of other traffic. Only after I managed to avoid collision with ground equipment and when I stabilized the airplane; I managed to push in the carb heat and slowly retract the flaps. The flaps are controlled by manual lever on this plane and are rather difficult to operate in such situation. I managed to successfully take off again and repeat the approach on left pattern. At numbers I was given clearance to land on Runway XXL.During base approach ATC changed my assigned runway to Runway XXR. I had to add power; but after turning final; I realized I added too much power and that I am too high. I tried to slip; but realized that it would not be safe; so I declared another go around; this time too high. On crosswind leg; ATC asked me if I need any help; which I declined. I was given landing clearance to Runway XXR and proceeded. I stabilized my approach; right landing speed at ~70 mph; but I did flare about a foot higher than would be optimal. Upon touchdown; it seems that my tail wheel locked in non-straight position. I immediately pushed full rudder to compensate; but still did not have sufficient rudder authority to fully correct. I held my elevator all the way up to keep the tail down and try to slow down the plane. I had to conscientiously keep telling myself to not to touch brakes; because I remember from ground school that it could result in dangerous situation. The aircraft started swerving and I departed Runway XXR to right into grass ~50 ft from taxiway Charlie where the aircraft rested safely. None of the parts of the aircraft except tires came into contact with ground. This situation fortunately resulted in zero injury; zero damage and was classified by airport personnel as 'Non-incident'.",,,,"C170 pilot reported a runway excursion during landing due to gusty winds.",

The wind aloft was from the southwest at about 20 knots giving us a ground speed of 115 knots. I was providing instruction to a student in a Cessna 152 and we contacted ZZZ tower to transit the Delta airspace. Our track was 014 degrees to our destination. I had the student advise the tower we would be at 2;500 and passing 1 mile east of the airport. Controller instructed to advise of any altitude changes. As we neared the airport the controller said 'no delay thru the arrival corridor.' I told the student to respond with 'roger.' When we were 1-1/2 miles southeast of the airport the controller said to 'expedite thru the arrival corridor.' I advised the controller we were a C152 and we were doing the best we could. The controller instructed us to turn eastbound for traffic inbound on the RNAV approach. We complied and turned. The controller called traffic to a Falcon jet as a Cessna at 12 o'clock; 4 miles eastbound at 2;500. Realizing the traffic was us; I scanned the sky quickly and spotted the traffic just to the left of our nose. I turned the aircraft to the right and observed the jet climb slightly and pass off our left side very rapidly. I called the traffic in sight and was told to pass behind the traffic before turning northbound. I acknowledged the turn. The controller then advised us to remain eastbound for additional traffic inbound on the RNAV approach 5 miles to our east. I saw the traffic and replied I would not do that and continued northbound to clear the final approach course. I advised that what had just happened was the worst service I'd seen in [over 20 years] of ATC experience. The controller then said I was 'outside of class Delta; frequency change approved.'Appalling does not begin to describe this situation. Although the controller meant to keep us south of the approach path with the eastbound turn; it was a) begun too late to keep lateral separation; b) did not take into account the wind drifting our flight path; and c) had the controller simply allowed us to remain at 2;500 MSL (1;500 AGL) our flight paths would have crossed about 1 mile east of the airport with my aircraft north of the final approach course. Additionally; when the Falcon jet would have been 1 mile east of the airport his altitude would have been around 400-500 AGL (providing for a 3 degree glide path) which would have maintained 1;000 feet of vertical separation when only 500 feet was required between an IFR and VFR aircraft.The poor judgment displayed by this controller was atrocious. Four different actions could have been taken if the controller was worried about separation. 1) A left turn to put us over the airport; 2) leaving us on course; 3) looking for and applying visual separation by either the pilot or controller; or 4) a right turn to keep us south of the approach course. The fourth option; done in a timely manner; would've worked. However; any of the other three would have been better. I have been flying for [over 40] years and that was the closest I've ever been to another aircraft while airborne.",,,,"C152 flight instructor reported an airborne conflict with a Falcon jet that was poorly handled by ATC.",

I flew my first solo flight and upon my second landing; the prop struck the runway.I had a lesson and [my instructor and I] had been preparing for me to solo at the end of the week. The tentative plan was for me to have two more lessons with [my instructor] before I was to solo. Did not practice flying between these two sessions; which was the longest amount of time that I had taken off from flying since I had started lessons. [My instructor] had previously asked me if I was ready to solo. I found this comment unusual since I thought that he would be the one telling me when I was ready. I said no and thought he was being humorous because I felt extremely under-prepared. He also asked me why I was not confident. I performed two touch and go's and two full stop landings with [my instructor] without issue and he asked me while taxiing back to the non-movement area if I was ready to solo. I felt confident after my two successful landings and agreed... although there was a part of me that was unsure. I also felt like I might be seen as a failure if I said no. [My instructor] exited the plane in the non-movement area and we agreed that I would meet him back at [the FBO] after I soloed. I assumed that he would be watching each landing and making sure that I adhered to the standards that we had discussed during our lessons. The first landing went smoothly (and [my instructor] stated that he had witnessed the landing and that it was near perfect). After taking off for the second time on my own; I was in the pattern and was instructed by the tower to extend my downwind. I did so until I was instructed by tower to turn base. The approach was stabilized until the plane started floating/ballooning over the runway and then I started sinking and pulled the nose up; but not quick enough to prevent the plane from impacting nose-first on the runway. The plane bounced hard on the runway several times in a row; but I was able to slow the airplane down and exit safely off of [the runway]. The tower told me to go to ground and I contacted ground; requesting to taxi back to [the runway]. I was shaken up after the rough landing; but did not think that the plane was damaged from the landing.

Once I got on the ground; my instructor briefed me on the situation and what happened. I unknowingly ended up 150 feet above the plane I was told to follow as I approached final.

There were two other aircraft in the pattern at the time; one of which was midfield downwind. The other was about .5 miles approaching abeam the departure end downwind. My solo student was given traffic to follow while [the student] was still on the upwind; the traffic was on the downwind almost abeam my student. My student acknowledged traffic in sight and was cleared to land. My student was at this point number three in the pattern; I do not recall if [the student] was cleared to land number three or just to follow the traffic and cleared to land.

With both aircraft on final and vertical separation of what appeared to be 150ft my student was told to go around which [the student] did and returned for landing uneventfully after that. Meanwhile the other aircraft on final had chosen to go around and break 45 degrees off of final to the east. After the flight I had debriefed with my student thoroughly as to what had occurred. It became evident to me that upon turning downwind [the student] had thought the first aircraft in the pattern whom had landing was actually the second aircraft that she was told to follow.

I completed the flight [which] was about 15 minutes and requested Rwy 13 for the landing as it was more aligned with the reported wind direction.  Prior to my descent on final; the winds were reported to a pilot departing on Rwy 24 as being calm; then a moment later they were reported again at 170 @ 7.  The plane was being buffeted on the approach and felt much stronger than the reported 7 mph.  I touched down and applied rudder to maintain directional control.

The weather was marginal winds [which] had decreased; ceilings were around 2;000-2;800 with precipitation along entire flight. Departed north bound activated VFR flight plan.  [Within about 25 nm] we confirmed we were going to have to stay low along [the highway]. To the west there was blue sky; we decide to climb to fly VFR on top back to [where] there was VFR conditions at with sky clear. As we climb to VFR conditions we were on top at 9;000 feet MSL as we continue north we were caused to have to climb higher after 20 miles at 9;000 feet. To continue VFR conditions we were at 12;500 feet. Temp was -12c wind was 200 @ 40 kts. As we approached ZZZ we experienced light engine roughness; at this point the sun was beginning to set; we were above a solid overcast layer at 13;000 feet MSL with freezing levels at 5;000 feet MSL. We were trying to circle and try and find a hole over ZZZ. I tried to improve the engine roughness with adjusting mixture for altitude; carb heat. When I pulled carb heat I had a severe engine drop in RPM at this point I realized we were in a emergency situation and there was a possibility we could have an engine failure with the temperature so cold the carb heat was not effective. The temperature dew point spread was within a degree of each other. After a few minutes of trying to find a hole in the overcast layer and troubleshooting the engine roughness I called ATC center as I was not on flight following at the time. I called them and [advised them of the situation] and they gave me a transporter code.  They asked me my intentions I told them I needed to get on the ground soon and I did not have the ability to shoot an approach and the risk of ice. ZZZ1 was reporting VFR conditions ATC advised me to continue to ZZZ1; The precipitation was the lightest. They cleared me to ZZZ1 via radar vectors 270 heading; at this point I was at 13;500 feet they wanted me to descend lower I told them I needed to stay VFR for ice conditions so I requested to stay higher they cleared me for 14;000 feet. As I was heading to ZZZ1 I realized I was facing a 40 knot head wind with a ground speed of 38 knots; temperature -15c. As we were heading towards ZZZ1; is where things started to get worse the engine was running very rough at this point I could not maintain altitude I was just on the edge of stall speed with the stall warning going off. I advised ATC that I would not be able to make it to ZZZ1 and asked them for any other airport nearby with better weather there was nothing with better weather that we would be able to stay VFR. I made the decision to attempt ZZZ knowing I would have to take a C162 IMC into Ice conditions. At this point I did not see any other options with the engine running so roughly and not improving. I definitely thought the engine was going to quit with carb heat on and barely running. ATC instructed me to turn to a heading and decided to 7;000 I used G300 to find ZZZ airport put the GPS into OBS mode and selected heading 120 for runway 12. I entered IMC at 13;200 feet MSL -14c; the sun had set by now and it was dark the temp was dropping we were picking up ice on the descent. I was descending at a rapid rate to get to warmer temperature. ATC was talking me though different heading to fly to get me lined up for the airport runway 12. They were able to get me to 4;000 feet MSL we were still IMC with temperature +1c. They could not clear me any lower with the runway in front of me. I changed to UNICOM 122.8 so I could turn the runway lights on. I turned on terrain function on the G300 and descended lower to see the airport at 3;500 feet MSL. I went back to ATC to report field in sight and I was going to land there. We were greeted by the fire department and EMTs.

I had not flown in six months and wanted to re-familiarize myself with the Cessna 152. The weather was cloudy with a 1 degree C difference between air temperature and dew point.  There were one or two planes in the pattern doing touch and goes on runway 20. I decided the weather was within my skill levels for the local flight I had planned.ATC ground instructed me to taxi to 20. Just before I got to the hold line the tower said I was cleared for an expedited takeoff (my words) with a departure to the southeast rather than the requested south because there was an IFR flight making an approach on runway 2 (opposite end of 20). I acknowledged the clearance and made my takeoff. As I climbed up through 200 feet AGL I was startled at the bad visibility. By the time I got to 500 feet AGL I didn't want to climb anymore for fear of loosing sight of the ground. I thought I had started a slow turn to the SE but in a later phone conversation with tower personnel I had turned to the SW. I cannot deny this because I was really distracted by the poor visibility. I was making a turn to the SE when the plane making the IFR approach on 2 came into view to my left; approximately 100 ft above and approximately 200 away. We both took evasive action banking to our respective right. I do not think we would have collided if evasive action had not been taken.I contacted the tower and requested a return for landing as I did not wish to continue in the poor visibly conditions that prevailed. I had become disorientated. The tower stayed in contact with me until I was able to fix my position. I was eventually able to climb to 800 AGL but felt the visibility was too poor to climb above that. I was able to land without further incident. From engine start up to engine shut down .5 hour of Hobbs time elapsed.Contributing factors: 1) my failure to make a 65 degree turn after takeoff and allowing myself to become too distracted by visual conditions. 2) ATC allowing an IFR approach on the opposite end of an active runway (20) 3) the spotty poor visibility conditions were not evident from the ground other than the AWOS report of scattered clouds at 200.",,,,"C152 pilot reported a NMAC after departure with an opposite direction IFR arrival.",

Over [a lake]; we heard a loud pop followed by extreme wind noise. I immediately took over control of the aircraft and identified the door was open. I asked the student to pull the door closed; which he informed me was missing.Upon a quick look over; unable to see the rest of the door structure due to the way it was folded; I determined the door had completely detached itself. I informed tower of the situation and advised them it had fallen below to the lake area. They cleared me for immediate landing back. I chose not to deploy flaps and maintained minimal pressure on the elevators since I was unsure if the door had contacted any of these surfaces upon its assumed departure from the aircraft.

I spotted a field north east of my position and I decided to do a precautionary landing there. I headed to the field and prepared for an off airport landing. I found out that I was high on altitude to land at that field. I extended base leg. Then turned towards it and I was still a little high. I had to pitch down and my airspeed was around somewhere in 80s (KIAS). I touched down and landing roll was considerably long due to high airspeed and also there was no flaps as I turned the master switch off earlier. I did put the flaps before the landing though as an instinctive procedure. I went through the power-lines during landing roll. Airplane came to a stop; I got out and inspected any damage. Airplane appeared undamaged. I called up the regional approach and owner of the airplane and explained the situation. In a short while; I also got in touch with the owner of that field.

Needing to move on to other areas of my sector that needed attention; I missed Aircraft X IDENT and had to have him IDENT again. I didn't get him radar identified until several miles from the airport.During a recent External Compliance Verification (ECV); DAB was found non-compliant with respect to radar identification methods; specifically DAB departures. The vast majority of our traffic remains in our local practice areas or with our satellite towers; all of which are assigned beacon codes from our local subset that do not generate flight data input/output Flight Progress Strips (FPS).Our current procedure requires our Local controllers to ensure departure aircraft have the correct auto-acquired data block information associated with the radar target prior to switching communications to departure. Although this is 100% safe and there is no question about radar identification; our procedure was ruled out of compliance with JO 7110.65 paragraph 5-3-2(a). The following addition to paragraph 5-3-2 would resolve the problem.'3. Tower controllers with CTRDs ensure that auto-acquired data block information corresponds with the radar target of the departure aircraft. Procedures for this method must be outlined in a local facility directive or LOA.'With the above addition; Local Control knows which radar target is which departure aircraft and if the correct data block information is displayed; there can be no confusion on the part of the departure controller as to which aircraft is which. Since DAB has decommissioned our manual drop tubes; we have run 3.5M operations without ever having our procedures questioned. The method is sound and our track record demonstrates such.The mitigation contained in a notice as a result of our noncompliance introduces unnecessary risk into our airspace without a change to the 7110. ID remains in the data block for 20 seconds; which is not site adaptable. If the departure corridor is shared between two controllers and two aircraft IDENT simultaneously; radar identification is questionable given our current procedures because we have to play ignorant; disregarding the correct data block information attached to the correct radar target. This forces the departure controller(s) to stare at departure data blocks for IDENTs; taking focus away from the rest of the airspace. Even with a standalone departure controller; IDENT drastically slows down the ability to ID aircraft and reduces the efficiency of the system.","DAB controller stated that previous procedure was safe as demonstrated yet not in compliance per JO 7110.65. Their use of drop tubes has been eliminated. The addition of having to identify each aircraft added a great deal of workload and reduced safety; for the amount of traffic operations. Efforts have been made to rewrite the JO 7110.65 to clarify method of RADAR identification utilizing CTRD and STARS automation through NATCA and their procedural specialist.",,,"DAB Departure Controller reported concerns with the new RADAR Identification procedures.",

While flying parallel to 31L; I was instructing my private student on what sort of distance we were looking for and performing our before landing checklist. I lost situational awareness temporarily and lost the Cessna; but believed I identified it further on making its base turn. I watched the aircraft pass by my wing and allowed about 30 seconds more to keep us separated. I then looked ahead of me and to my left to make sure I was clear of traffic before turning base. I instructed my student on what a proper base looked like before turning final. By then I still had not been cleared to land so I was about to query the Tower when another call came on saying they were on final with someone above them. Even though we have a parallel runway there was enough doubt in my mind I executed a missed approach; and banked to the right to stay clear of the traffic which I located under me and to my right. I exited the pattern and request instruction to rejoin. It was later I learned the Diamond I would come in close contact with was on a right base for the same runway at a different altitude and that is why I wasn't able to pick him up in my scan as I was focused on left downwind traffic. I believe the problem was caused by a variety of factors. One being that the other aircraft and I didn't see each other; and it is my opinion this close call could have been avoided if [ATC] had intervened when he saw two aircraft on base heading towards each other.",,,,"C152 instructor pilot reported a NMAC in the airport traffic pattern.",

About five miles out; I checked the AWOS and made a position report over the CTAF. Dodge County UNICOM responded telling me the winds and the altimeter setting.

As I was going around I saw the wind sock and noticed it was pointing in the opposite direction; more in line with Runway 02.Instead of turning crosswind for Runway 20 and going around the pattern; I continued to climb for a straight departure. Not hearing anyone else on the CTAF I turned around to do a straight in for Runway 02. I announced my position on 2 mile final for Runway 02. I continued in on final and when I rounded out; my eyes went to the end of the runway during the flare. That's when I saw a plane taking off from the other end of the runway. He lifted off and turned hard right immediately. We avoided each other by several hundred feet. I turned off on the first available taxiway. I never heard him call out that he was departing. As soon as I was on the taxiway I called up the UNICOM asking for a radio check; no one answered me. Immediately after; Aircraft Y called the UNICOM asking for a radio check. They answered that they heard him loud and clear. Aircraft Y then called on the CTAF asking me; do you copy. I responded that I copied; but he didn't say anything else so I don't know if he heard me. I called the UNICOM two more times asking for a radio check. It wasn't until the last time that they responded saying they heard me and [another aircraft] also responded saying they heard me. I then asked if they heard me the whole time. They responded saying they heard me on the go-around.I don't know [if] something went wrong with my radio or my push to talk button. The lack of response from the UNICOM on my first radio check requests and the [other aircraft] saying he heard my go-around call out but not my 2 mile final call out seems to me like there was some equipment issue. I don't know if Aircraft Y did or did not make a departure call. His calling for a radio check to the UNICOM would seem to suggest he did.The incident has led me to institute several changes to procedures and checklists. My CFI told me it doesn't matter where you enter the traffic pattern as long as you announce your position; and I hear airplanes doing straight in approaches at my home airport on a regular basis. In the future; however; I will not be doing straight in approaches unless needed. I will always be entering the pattern on the downwind to ensure I can check for traffic on the ground.

The pilot had trouble acknowledging the clearance and sounded as if he was a student pilot. I relayed instructions to the pilot again to taxi to the runway to which he acknowledged the instructions. He advised me on frequency he was 'ready to go.' I instructed Aircraft X to contact Tower as I saw the aircraft holding short of the runway. Some coordination occurred between our Radar Controller and Local Control and a crop duster had called on Local Control frequency. As I took care of an IFR clearance and taxi instruction; I look up and see Aircraft Y on short final and an aircraft on the runway. The pilot of Aircraft Y is keying up on frequency saying 'What is that aircraft doing on the runway?' As the Controller in Charge in the Tower; I instructed the Local Controller to have Aircraft Y to go around. The pilot sidestepped to the side of the runway and went around. The Local Controller reached out to Aircraft X on frequency to turn left and exit the runway immediately. The pilot was later given the Brasher Statement and taxied back to the runway for departure. The pilot of Aircraft X never called for takeoff clearance and taxied onto the runway without any ATC instruction. The pilot attempted to takeoff without an ATC clearance. Had it not been for the swift collective action between ATC and pilots to initiate a go around; the aircraft may have collided.The aircraft came from a flight school that has had multiple issues with Air Traffic Control instructions at this facility in the past.

Seconds into the downwind turn a twin-engine Cessna cut up and across the nose of my plane with an estimated miss distance of 10 to 20 feet. I flew through the wake turbulence/prop wash of the twin-engine seconds later when I entered the air where the twin-engine had been. The twin-engine continued its ascent up and out of the airspace. After the near midair collision no calls came from the Tower; the twin-engine; nor myself. I was given clearance for my next touch and go shortly after. No corrective action was taken by myself due to the lack of time to react to the NMAC. I was not informed of the traffic or any actions to take nor do I remember the twin-engine having been given information on my location. I believe that this contributed to the incident and if information of this type had been given alongside preventative actions; such as an extended upwind for either aircraft involved; this incident could have been avoided.

After takeoff; upon reaching 700 feet I turned crosswind; forgetting to instead follow the Cessna ahead. As I continued climbing to 1;000 feet on crosswind leg; Tower informed me that I had cut off the Cessna traffic in front of me and to make a 360. The transmission was somewhat garbled; and I only heard the phrase '360'; I did not hear the direction in which to turn; so I made the decision to turn to the right and began a right 360 at a standard rate of turn. Soon after I started this turn I came in sight of the Cessna traffic; which I had cut off on its left downwind leg and was until that point hidden behind my right wing; as I was flying in the opposite direction. Since this was now a head-on situation; I turned hard right to avoid the traffic. Once the planes were clear of each other; Tower called me back in after one touch and go to land full stop and return to the [FBO]. I was informed after I returned to the [FBO] that the Tower had in fact instructed me to make a left 360 instead of the right 360 which I had began to make; and as a result had made a non-ideal; but still very fixable; situation into a very dangerous one.I first neglected to follow the Cessna traffic ahead of me; which led to my turning crosswind leg early and cutting off that traffic. In the future; I must be much more cognizant of surrounding traffic and my takeoff clearance instructions. When tower instructed me to make a 360 to avoid the Cessna traffic; I did not ask for clarification as far as the direction in which to turn because I was more preoccupied with maneuvering as soon as I could; rather than waiting and making the correct maneuver which would have been much less dangerous. In the future; I must remember to always ask for clarification before performing maneuvers in the pattern if I do not hear them clearly the first time. I also must be more aware of the general traffic pattern flow; because I should have realized that turning a left 360 would not put me in a head-on situation; while a right 360 would; and did.",,,,"C152 student pilot reported a near mid-air collision with another aircraft in traffic pattern.",

The fuel gauges read tanks on the right & slightly less on the left. This aircraft has the extended range tanks. I also fly a C170B with standard tanks. When I used the dip stick to measure fuel the indication showed that I had .5 inches in each tank. In the C170B that is calibrated to 4 gallons usable in each tank. That equates to 1 hour flight time. The additional 10 gals in each tank from the size change equates to an additional 1+ hour flight time. With 2+ hours of fuel I launched without adding more.During the [short] trip to ZZZ1; I noticed that the fuel gauges were erratic; going from tanks to empty and back. So; I paid special attention to the clock to insure I could make it back to ZZZ with fuel.After 4 pattern circuits with no prolonged waiting for takeoff; I headed back to ZZZ. On the climb out I did notice that both fuel gauges were reading empty. I attributed it to the erratic gauge issue earlier as the time said I had enough fuel. I got to approximately the 6-statute mile 45 entry to XXR pattern at ZZZ.  As I was descending from 2500 feet to pattern altitude; I felt the loss of power.  I verified the mixture was full rich; tank selector was on both; I pushed the throttle full in and there was no increase in engine RPM.  I slowed to best glide speed and [requested priority handling].I let them know that I may not make the airport and may have to set it down on [a road] that parallels the runways on the east side; closer to me from where I was coming from. As I got closer; I thought I might make XYL; the opposite to the current flight operations.  As I got closer still; I realized I could not make that and set up for a landing on the road.  Then I thought about trying one more thing; pumping the throttle one more time.  I got a burst of power that allowed me get over airport property.  But the hangars I was now over put me too high for a XYL landing; I continued across the field to the XYR runway and managed to set the airplane down in the last 1;000 feet. And get stopped before running off the pavement. I rolled off of XYR onto the run up area between the runways.  I pumped the throttle several more time to keep the engine running and got permission to cross the takeoff end of XXR to maybe get back to the FBO; but the engine quit while on XXR and I had to be towed back to the FBO. Total time for the flight was 1.5 hours Hobbs.What I learned was that 1+1 does not necessarily equal 2+ when you do not know exactly how 2 different sized tanks relate to a calibrated dip stick for the smaller tank.Also learned not to pass up 4 options to put gas in the tank. 1st before takeoff; 2nd at ZZZ1 before returning; 3rd at ZZZ2 going and coming back.",,,,"A Cessna 170 pilot reported undercalculating the fuel required for a flight; resulting in a fuel starvation event; and a near off-airport forced landing.",

The winds were been relatively calm; and despite training numerous 'soft field' takeoffs and landings for private and commercial ratings; we had never actually used a grass runway. We spoke with some of the regulars in the FBO; who said that the turf condition was good and they provided some tips for using that particular field. We had two pilots in the aircraft; which put the C152 within 3 lbs of max gross weight when full of fuel. We back taxied the length of the field to reposition and test the smoothness of the turf. At the end; we turned a 180 and conducted a rolling takeoff without coming to a stop.The plane reached rotation speed after about 1;000 ft. (of 1;800 ft. available) but on climb out; it became apparent we would not clear the power lines and trees on the far side of the airport. With no more power to give; the aircraft already in clean configuration; and the stall horn starting to sound; I cut power and put the plane back on the runway; resulting in the plane coming to a stop in the grass after the end of the turf runway across Runway 24 and the taxiway. No damage to the plane; facility; or any injuries; but definitely two shaken up pilots after a close call.A combination of factors contributed; most of which were related to operating at max gross weight on a hot summer day. Application of soft field considerations (not coming to a stop) over short field considerations (max power before releasing brakes) reduced the amount of available runway to less than full length.We did not recalculate a takeoff landing distance card for that particular runway because we had been flying all day. However; if we had; we still would have tried the takeoff. The fact the performance charts indicate we needed a total of 2020 ft. to clear a 50 ft. obstacle with approximately 1;000 ft. of ground roll. We had 1;800 ft. runway plus another 900-1;000 ft. of clear climb out space before the first obstacle; which should have been more than adequate; but was not enough on that day.We suspect the combination of flying a 40 year old airplane with pilots relatively new to the C152 also significantly reduced aircraft performance from the best case numbers in the published charts. Biggest lesson learned is that when close to the margins on gross weight and high Density Altitude; to always take the longest runway winds will allow.",,,,"C152 pilot reported difficulty climbing on departure from a grass runway; resulting in a rejected takeoff.",

The wind conditions were approximately at 13 kts.; gusting 17 kts. There was light turbulence and as a result; I had to use a substantial amount of power to maintain pattern altitude.After a single landing; we were back on downwind; the throttle was at about 70-80% to sustain pattern altitude. However; when I decided to pull power back; I noted that the throttle was stuck. It would go the rest of the way in but no further back; resulting in us being stuck at roughly 2350 rpm (redline is 2550 rpm). I immediately reported the issue to my CFI; who promptly took the flight controls and [made a call] on CTAF. Since we had no control of power; we were forced to cut off the mixture in order to land the plane. However; as we were on final; the engine refused to quit; despite the mixture being at idle cutoff; resulting in us going around.We tried another lap in the pattern again; this time additionally utilizing the fuel shutoff valve; no luck as it would take a couple of minutes for it to take effect. In the spite of the moment; my instructor deployed flaps to slow the plane down about 5kts above Vfe (Flap Extension Speed); there was no resulting damage. On the next lap; my instructor had me hold the mixture at cut-off to ensure complete fuel starvation; but no luck; the engine still kept coming back to life at a high enough rpm to foil the landing attempt.On the last lap; I suggested turning off the mags to kill the engine when abeam our touchdown point. Fortunately; we never had to default to that plan as the throttle valve became unstuck on the final lap and we were able to perform a landing in accordance with the precautionary landing with engine power checklist. I noted a drop of oil pressure on final and the engine began to run rough. After we landed and exited the runway; the engine quit altogether.We tried a restart in hopes that we could try to cautiously taxi the plane back to the ramp; but the engine refused to start. Shortly after; the throttle became stuck again; although this had no effect as the engine was dead. We decided to run the securing checklist on the taxiway and await a tow to the flight schools maintenance hangar. When we got out to assess the plane; my instructor noted a clanking noise when moving the prop.The cause of the incident was identified as a faulty part in the float-chamber that went by the pre-buy inspection of the aircraft unnoticed and over the months; the running of the engine shook the part loose altogether; resulting in an uncontrollable flow of fuel mixture to the carburetor; resulting in a stuck throttle valve and unreliable mixture control. Fortunately; there was enough air to sustain combustion.",,,,"C152 student pilot reported encountering a stuck throttle and difficulty shutting down the engine while in the traffic pattern.",

As I had no communication or coordination with the other aircraft; its intentions were unknown to me; so to avoid a possible midair collision; I chose to take evasive action; and turned away from the other aircraft. I also descended while in the turn only to see the ADS-B in display of other aircraft follow me in the turn and the descent. I could not tell exactly how far away from me the other aircraft was; and I could not visually see it; but my traffic display showed the other aircraft with no vertical separation and little or no lateral separation. The initial right turn and descent was started from approximately 1500 ft. MSL; and a 340 degree heading; all the way down to about 700-800 ft. MSL; and a heading of 160 degrees. At that time the other aircraft was still closing; following my evasive action. I then made a left; 360 degree turn at 800 ft.

During the maneuver; I broadcast on 122.75 to try and raise the other aircraft; but I did not receive a reply. My aircraft is equipped with ADS-B in; so the registration number of the other aircraft is tagged with its position and altitude on my display screen. During my evasive action it was not possible to know if the other aircraft was not about to collide with mine. The information on my traffic display showed the other aircraft to actually be on top of me with a vertical separation of +/-0 feet. Needless to say this situation could cause a pilot to take such severe action as to jeopardize safety of flight and cause an accident. It seemed clear the other aircraft intentionally closed on mine and followed me through evasive maneuvers while continuing to close.

The flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ [was] fine and uneventful. After landing at ZZZ; [the Pilot] flew three takeoffs and landings in his Cessna 170 satisfactorily to full stops and taxied back. We then taxied into [the FBO] and met with [the Examiner] from the FSDO; where he said that I would be PIC (Pilot in Command) since [the Pilot] did not have a medical. We taxied to Runway XX and did a normal takeoff whereupon he was directed to fly northeast for about 10 miles. [The Examiner] asked [the Pilot] to fly various places and positions; so he could ascertain his visual prowess which he showed to be fine. [The Examiner] also asked him to fly a practice emergency landing which was marginal.[The Examiner] seemed satisfied and directed [the Pilot] to fly back to ZZZ whereupon he joined a right downwind leg for Runway XX. The approach was satisfactory which put us on a short final for Runway XX. [The pilot] had kept mentioning doing a wheel landing but I saw that he was going too slow and flared a little high to do a wheel landing. In other words; had he done a three point landing; he probably would have been fine. Because of being slow and a little high; he did bounce on the main gear; which I saw would happen. But I wanted to let him recover from it by doing the simple [act of] putting the nose down to stop the next bounce. At that point he did not fix the issue; so I then intervened and put the nose down which put us in a level condition [and] stopped the porpoising action. All there was to do was let the plane continue straight ahead and allow the tail to come down into a three point configuration.When the tail came down; the plane started to turn right; to which I immediately applied full left rudder and brake which should have easily prevented the plane from going right at all. The plane continued to turn right in spite of full rudder and brake; which took us to the right of the runway and [to] the right side of the taxiway. I [then] realized [the pilot] was applying both brakes; which eliminated any chance of regaining steering control again. In all my many years [of] teaching conventional gear flying; I have never been unable to correct any plane moving left or right until that moment; where I realized that if the pilot in the left seat is applying both brakes; I lose any ability to correct the aircraft from the right seat - which; to this point; nobody had ever done before.As we went onto the taxiway having no ability to turn the plane; he headed straight for the taxiway lights and all I could think [of] was [that] he was going to hit the prop and damage the engine. After getting out of the airplane and looking; to my amazement; the prop did NOT strike any lights. Rather; the tire rolled over one of the breakaway taxi lights and the other two lights hit the bottom of the tail section that made a very small thumbnail dent. Realizing the aircraft was not damaged; we taxied back to [the FBO] and called the Airport Administrator to report the taxiway lights that had been damaged. Afterward; I spoke to [the Examiner] and related to him that with both brakes being applied; I simply had no ability to correct the airplane's path. If it had been him just pushing the wrong rudder or not enough rudder; I could have easily corrected the airplane's path and stayed on the center line of the runway.After wrapping up everything; we flew back to ZZZ1; whereupon landing he did start to the right again; but I hit full left rudder and brake which straightened the plane out. [It] surprised me especially considering [the pilot] has over 5;000 hours and a Commercial pilot's license. I asked him how much flying he had done since [a few months ago] to which he related to me... none.

The shaking got worse and the plane then swung around to the right and ground looped. The wings did not contact the surface and there was no prop strike. The airplane was then towed to the hangar where I worked with a mechanic to change the wheel and tire so that the plane could be moved while inside the hangar. I did identify some contributing factors. There was a strong right crosswind; it was my student's first landing; and I had previous issues with my tires slipping on grooved runways.

On the third landing approach there was a Cessna 150 ahead of us in the pattern.  I extended the downwind to make room and turned base and final much further out than typical. One of the things we had been practicing is making sure to be low enough on the approach to not overshoot since it is such a short runway.  On this approach I was quite low and setup a little low on final when I realized that while I had seen the C150 land I wasn't certain it had cleared the runway. I thought it might still be on there and asked my instructor if we should go around. He said no and to go ahead and land since we didn't see the other aircraft on the runway anymore and we would be landing very short. The previous loop around the pattern I initiated a go around because it didn't feel right but was assured that we were setup just right for landing and should've landed.  I think that I was reluctant to do another go around 'for no reason' if I didn't need to according to the instructor.Shortly after landing and rolling out several feet and up the incline in the runway we saw the other airplane at the far end. At just about the same time we heard frantic calls for the other airplane to get off the runway as soon as possible.  I was setup for a short field landing and exited the runway after a very short landing roll about 1;700 feet from where the other aircraft had exited the runway.  We were shaken from the realization that we had shared the runway and scared the other training aircraft.Contributing factors:1. Fatigue- This was one of the first training sessions after a 4 month break and my instructor and I were exhausted.2. Human Factors - I deferred to my instructors experience and decided against the go around.  We have since discussed this issue and agreed that if either of us feel a go around is a good idea we will go around.3. Airport -  The runway X landing zone is at a significantly lower elevation than the XX end of the runway. because of the geography is difficult to see aircraft at the other end.",,,,"Pilot reported a Critical Ground conflict during landing rollout with opposite direction non-reporting traffic.",

I had the traffic in sight and it appeared to be still on the horizon; which made me think that it was converging on my altitude. Being a Bonanza; I saw the characteristic fork tail and initially thought the aircraft was flying away from my direction. I then realized it was coming closer and closer. I did not receive any updated advisories from Approach about the convergence of the Bonanza and my aircraft. As the plane came within 1/2 mile within one minute; I took immediate evasive action to climb 200 to 300 feet above my 6;500 foot cruising altitude.

After climbing to 035 and completing steep turns; we set up to do power on stalls and climbed to 050. We then set up to do power off stalls. After completing 4 power off stalls; we still had significant altitude and I decided to give student an engine out by pulling the mixture. The student set up the aircraft for best glide and selected an airfield that was about three miles away and ran through the restart checklist. Every 1500 feet I would advance the mixture and push forward on the yoke to make sure the engine was staying primed. We then simulated part of the forced landing checklist (ELT; squawk codes; emergency calls) and performed the landing brief.The student chose to try to get to the airfield by going down the downwind then realized that student was too low and close to the runway to safely make it to the field. I asked student what the backup plan was and student selected a field to right of the aircraft that student could easily turn into. Student turned the aircraft to the field and I estimated that student could easily make the landing and that student had the engine back and to do a go-around. I advanced the mixture and the engine sputtered and died and the prop stopped. The student announced that I had the controls and I pointed the airplane to the field that student had selected. I checked the mixture in; shut off valve on; then attempted to restart the engine with the key. After two attempts; I determined that we were too low and shut off the fuel valve and pulled the mixture and landed the plane in the field.There was no damage to the plane; no injuries to myself or my student; and no property damage. Fuel levels were still visible and greater than half way from the top of the tanks (well over 1/2 full; I didn't have a fuel stick to check total actual levels); oil level was still at 5 qts. We were able to later restart the airplane and taxi it closer to the property owner's barn with permission.The biggest thing that I learned was that I will not pull the mixture to simulate an engine out any more. That was the mistake that I feel caused this. In the future; all engine outs will be initiated by pulling the throttle. Though this has been common in my training from private to commercial; it put us in a dangerous situation that I could have avoided.",,"At the altitude of 4;000 feet my Instructor pulled the mixture in the aircraft to simulate an emergency landing. At that moment I trimmed the plane all the way; pulled the carb heat and pitched the airplane for 60 kts. Next I looked for a place we could simulate the landing and we were just 2-4 miles from [an] airport. We were descending approximately 500 feet per minute. The closer we got I realized that I was too low to make the obstacles. I made the error of not looking at the altitude of the field. Therefore; I looked to my right and there was a large field and I pointed to my instructor that at that moment the safest decision was to do the field on the right. My instructor said that was a good decision and I started my turn to the field.My airspeed was 60; my right hand was on the throttle; which at the time it was all in. My left hand on the controls and my feet on the rudder. A few seconds later my Instructor looked at me and said 'you would have made it' and he decided to end the simulation by putting the mixture all in. However; the engine would not work and my instructor said 'my controls' I restated 'your controls' and he took charge of the plane. He tried turning the engine on a couple times and the propeller would just not move at all. It happened in a matter of seconds. Since I had already lined up the airplane to the field; my Instructor worked hard to fly the airplane until it touched the ground where he applied the brakes after he had landed it safely. We turned all the systems off and removed the key from the starter. We opened the doors and got out of the aircraft. We called the flight school and they came to get us and to see the airplane.",,"C152 Instructor and student pilot reported a forced landing resulted when the engine failed to start following a simulated engine failure.",

The airplane was successfully landed back on Runway XX with no damages or injuries to the airplane and pilots.The power loss was felt at 300 ft. During takeoff; full throttle was applied with full mixture and no carburetor heat. Everything registered normal until the airplane got airborne. The RPM on the tachometer was reading below normal levels at around 1;900 to 2;000 RPM instead of the usual 2;400 RPM during takeoff. Due to the fix-pitch propeller; a lower angle of attack was implement to shallow out the climb and build airspeed. The airplane was able to achieve a maximum airspeed of 75 kts. in straight and level flight. No further attempts were made to continue the climb once the airplane reached 500 ft. Troubleshoot procedures were conducted in compliance with section 3 of the Cessna 152's Pilot's Operating Handbook for Engine Failure During Flight (Restart Procedures) and Precautionary Landing with Engine Power.After executing the troubleshoot procedures; normal RPM levels did not register on the tachometer. The RPM levels remained low. There was also a strong heavy vibration that came from the engine; especially when the carburetor heat was applied. The vibrations felt like a 'skipping heartbeat'. It was suspected that one of the cylinders did not provide enough power; possibly due to a fuel; valve; or timing issue with the engine. Fortunately; there was no indications of a total engine failure no smoke; no burning smells; and no visual indicators of abnormal exterior irregularities.ZZZ Tower was then notified of Aircraft X's issue on climbout where a priority landing was requested. ZZZ Tower issued several airplanes to give way to Aircraft X as it circled to land back onto the Runway XX. After landing; ZZZ controllers were informed about why Aircraft X needed to have priority back to the Runway.

Working through the relevant checklists did not result in a restoration of power. I decided to return to the airport (ZZZ) and advised ATC about the engine condition and our return to the airport. ATC instructed us to join the right-hand traffic pattern for Runway XX. When we were handed off to ZZZ Tower I [requested priority landing] on Runway XX; since it was not clear how long we would have engine power; and we were barely able to maintain our altitude; any delay seemed undesirable and [requesting priority landing] was the easiest choice. We were cleared to land on Runway XX; and upon reaching the downwind leg I initiated a power-off 180 approach with an uneventful landing. We had followed the local procedures for high elevation (ca. 3300 ft. MSL); i.e.; leaned the mixture for taxi to avoid carbon/lead build-up at the spark plugs. The run-up check resulted in no abnormalities; ca. 75 RPM drops on each magneto; and the engine ran smoothly; we leaned the mixture for 'best power' prior to departure. Upon take-off; the power production of this particular plane has always been on the low side (perhaps 2100-2200 RPM); and on that particular flight it was on the lower end of this range. I was not concerned because the engine ran smoothly; oil temperature and pressure were 'green;' and the take-off RPM seemed normal for this aircraft (especially when considering the high elevation). The 'climb' checklist; which involved checking oil temperature and pressure also indicated no abnormalities. I am thus not sure this situation could have been avoided using the standard checks that pilots can perform prior to the flight.",,,,"C152 flight instructor reported engine malfunction inflight.

We were conducting touch and go's on Runway XX. After a few laps in the pattern we were on the departure leg when I heard a radio call that a Yak aircraft was 3 NM southwest of the airport and that they were inbound to enter left traffic Runway XX at 2;000 ft. Very shortly after we made a radio call that we were turning left crosswind for Runway XX and began making the cross wind turn. We did not have visual contact with the Yak. Yak made a call that they had the 'departing traffic in sight'. We proceeded to make the downwind turn and radio call for Runway XX.Shortly after we turned downwind the Yak announced they were also turning downwind. At that point an ADS-B traffic advisory popped up our GPS. The ADS-B traffic showed the Yak at our 6 O'clock position at the same altitude and closing. Another pilot in the traffic pattern announced on CTAF that the Yak was right on top of us and use caution. At that point I announced on CTAF that I would be making a right 360 turn for spacing and that we would follow in behind the Yak.The Yak announced that they couldn't see us and thanked us for yielding to them. Immediately after; the Yak made a radio call that they too would be making a right 360 turn for spacing. It was at this point I decided the best course of action to avoid a collision would be to make a descending turn to the east and leave the airport environment. In doing so I descended to about 600 ft. MSL from the traffic pattern altitude of 868 ft. MSL and overflew some buildings at about 600 ft MSL. Once I heard the Yak was continuing in for landing I started climbing back to an appropriate altitude. We maneuvered back into the airport environment and landed without further issue.The problem arose by the Yak's non-standard pattern entry and decision to also perform a 360 degree turn in the pattern. Contributing factors: Our 152 is a high wing and the Yak is a low wing. The Yak may have associated our radio calls with a different aircraft in the pattern.",,,,"C152 flight Instructor reported a NMAC in the traffic pattern occurred when another aircraft flew directly over them in the downwind leg.

Met with student called and got a weather briefing. Ceilings were approximately 4;100 ft. above ground level with a scattered layer at 2;000 ft. above ground level winds approximately 160 at 10 kts. and light precipitation to the southwest of the airport. Pre-flight with student determined no abnormalities and there was 5.5-gal gas in right tank and between 7 and 8 in the left tank. This was to be a short several pattern flight of less than 1 hour. Engine run-up determined that all systems were normal. The flight departed and we did 3 crosswind touch and go landings all seemed normal. On the fourth; flaps were retracted; carb heat turned off and power was applied. The engine seemed to be producing normal power and we lifted of at approximately 55 kts. near the intersection of or just past XX Taxiway. At approximately 100-200 ft. above ground level we experienced an unexpected substantial loss in engine power. I scanned the flow items for engine failure. The flaps were in the up position; mixture was full rich; primer in and locked; mags were to the both position. I promptly pulled carb heat on and noted no improvement. It was at this point that I had to make a decision to continue on with limited power or close the throttle and land. We did not appear to be climbing and I wanted to land the aircraft in a controlled fashion; so I pulled the throttle to idle and deployed the flaps to full 30 degrees in an attempt to get down quickly and stopped before the tree/fence line. As we approached; I noted that we would not make it stopped before the tree/fence line; so I altered course to the right lowering the nose of the airplane in an attempt to maintain safe airspeed. As we paralleled the tree/fence line we came to a landing in a field of soybeans in a controlled fashion. The propeller was still spinning at this time; and I pulled the mixture to idle cut off. The engine did not quit so I turned the fuel selector to the off position and pulled harder back on the mixture. The propeller then stopped. The Tower Controller called for us on the radio and I replied that we were on the ground. I then told my student to exit the airplane and go towards the tail in an attempt to get away from the propeller and engine just in case there was a fire and I finished shutting down and securing the avionics. I tried calling the Tower by telephone but could not get through; I then called the owner of the flight school to tell him what had happened; he asked if everyone was okay and what had happened. By this time; I could hear the emergency vehicles in route and tried calling the Tower again by telephone. I did get through this time and told them that we were both okay. While waiting for the Authorities to arrive I took the cap off the right fuel tank (the lower of the two) and noted approximately 3.5 gallons of fuel. Authorities and fire arrived; they asked if we were okay and what had happened. The officer on scene had contacted the FAA before he allowed the airplane to be towed back to the maintenance hangar. The airplane was upright with no apparent damage.

The aircraft is a Cessna 152 and the flight was operated under PART 91 Instructional Flight. During engine run up; my student and I noticed that the Right magneto was fouled; hence we followed proper clean-up procedure like we have done countless times in the past. Everything resumed normal; so we departed ZZZ via Runway XXR with a departure request of 'Left turn over the river.' Shortly after departing; I told my student that she missed a checklist item of 'Departure Brief' so I intentionally made her return to the airport; taxi to runup area and brief me. Since this student was taking her checkride the next day; I wanted to hold her to a higher standard. The incident took place on the second departure on the same runway with the same request. Upon reaching the practice area and reaching about 2700 MSL; I noticed the RPM gauge needle went from 2300 RPM to about 1800 RPM for less than a second and it resumed normal operations. My first thought was my student must have been messing with the throttle; so I asked her and she said no; also showing me her right hand which had the throttle in full open position. At that point I had a bad feeling so I tuned into ZZZ Tower and requested inbound due to engine roughness. The reason I reported roughness was to let the controllers have a heads up that my situation could possibly worsen so they might be a little more alert. The Tower asked if I was [requesting priority handling] to which I replied no since I had good control of my plane and the engine sputters every now and then but it was still flying. I did make sure that the mixture was full rich. Upon approaching midfield; Tower [gave priority] for me and asked my fuel and souls on board. Right after I answered; my engine suffered from partial power. My RPM gauge now shows 1700RPM even at full throttle. My first instinct was to pitch for best glide and already had XXR in my mind to land. I made sure the fuel selector was on ON position; verify that the mixture is full rich even though I already enriched it prior to returning; and pulled to activate the carb heat. The only thing I did not do was check the mags since I didn't know if that would worsen my situation. I also did not [request priority handling] since it was already [requested] and I landed safely on XXR. Upon exiting; I did let the Ground Controller know that no further assistance was required and my plane did taxi to parking. I did not receive any information so I asked a police officer for the Tower phone number and called them. I offered my phone number; and full name. The mechanics said that the Cylinder Ring was broke and the grove was badly damaged. They said I was smart to have returned on the initial rpm dropped because it could have been worse. I have the pictures of the damage after the engine was torn down. My learning experience definitely is huge! I was so glad I trusted my gut feeling and returned. However; next time I will [request priority handling] sooner. I shouldn't have been hesitant about it; and I was amazed on how the controllers made sure I came in safe. I need to get these guys donuts and coffee. I'm glad I remembered my training but also will communicate more next time. I was more focused on getting down safely which I'm glad that no one was injured and the plane was in one piece.",,,,"C-152 Flight Instructor with student on training flight reported engine malfunction inflight.",

Nothing was out of the ordinary. I taxied from the FBO to Runway XX via Alpha. I proceeded to execute my engine run up. Again; nothing seemed to be wrong. After about 4 takeoffs and 2 landings ahead of me; I began to start the takeoff. I pushed full throttle but the plane seemed to be slow in accelerating. There was engine roughness and aggressive shaking. It has happened before where there has been some slowness in acceleration and engine roughness but as soon as you get off the ground; everything is good. I also thought it could be the nose wheel shaking; causing the shaking of the plane. I reached 50 KIAS and rotated. As I rotated; the stall horn squeaked. I lowered the nose and attempted to gain airspeed to climb. However; the rate of climb was extremely slow. I noticed the RPMs have not increased past 2;100 RPM. With this as well as severe engine roughness; I decided I needed to return to the airport.I made the radio call as follows: 'Tower; Aircraft X is facing extreme engine roughness and is struggling to climb. We would like to return to Runway XX'. The controller advised me to turn downwind when able. The height to turn downwind is 700 feet and the elevation of the land under the downwind leg is around 500 feet. I was unable to climb higher than 400 feet in the two minutes I had been in the air. I then said; Aircraft X; we are not able to climb high enough um is it possible for me to turn around and land on Runway XY?; which is the opposing runway of XX. The controller approved this and cleared me to land on Runway XY. I turned around while configuring for landing. He asked if I needed any assistance to which I said that I did not. I never requested priority handling because the engine was still running just not at full power. I landed safely and taxied back to the FBO via Alpha. I shut down the engine and downed the aircraft to get maintenance to look at it.",,,,"Pilot reported engine roughness and unable to control engine RPM after take off.

After run up I was advised to switch to Tower and did so; and continued the taxi to the runway hold short bars. I called up Tower and said I was coming up on XXR and ready to go. Tower responded promptly with instructions to take off on Runway XXL. Although I was anticipating XXR for takeoff; being told to take off XXL was not out of the usual as I have received similar instructions at ZZZ prior to this event; where I have to cross the closer runway to depart off the left. When I was given this instruction; I very explicitly mentioned the left 2 times on my reply call to avoid any mistakes but also for myself as an out-loud reminder that I was now departing off the LEFT and not the original runway I had been planning for. I said 'Ok; continuing to XX LEFT; and XX LEFT cleared for takeoff; Aircraft X'.As I crossed the hold short and finished my final checks 'Lights; Camera; Action; Finals Clear' - I looked left and immediately noticed another Cessna on a short final for XXR; while at the same time braking quickly and coming to a stop while the frequency also went crazy with blocked transmissions (assuming everyone chiming in to prevent a possible incursion or accident). Although I had begun crossing the hold short; I did not enter the actual pavement surface the runway and the other Cessna executed a safe go around. At that point I asked Tower what they wanted me to do; and they instructed me to 180 U turn and hold short XXR; which I complied with and was then cleared for takeoff from XXR. There had been a student pilot holding short opposite at XXL and its possible Tower thought that is who called for takeoff. I am always diligent with my final checks before taking a runway and departing; and I think my final look left before fully entering the runway is what prevented this from being more serious. From now on I will make sure to have a more 'big picture' understanding before rolling for takeoff - I was thinking why did I not see him on my ADS-B and I realized because both my GPS units were zoomed in to airport taxi diagrams. I always cock the airplane sideways when holding short due to the high wing not allowing you to see any aircraft on final; but as I had been on a slow roll already when I was cleared for takeoff I did not get to see final until that final moment.

As we reported a short (1/4 nm final); a colleague in another airplane was holding short of Runway XZ/XY with a clear view of the final approach corridor for Runway XY. He reported that it appeared to him that the Cirrus would land long. I spotted the Cirrus low and fast over the runway.

My hand was not on the control; because I wanted her to be independent taking controls when it comes to practicing landing. On the last lesson; there were times when she yawed to the right after aiming point; and somehow she got back to centerline and landed. So I decided to trust her controls but she couldn't manage it.

We were cleared by Ground Control to taxi to the Company X Ramp; which is accessible by Taxilane 1. Both the ramp and the taxilane are non-movement areas.The taxilane connects to the ramp facing the end of a double row of parking spaces; where the taxilane splits left and right to continue down either side of the parking rows. The left path has parking spaces on either side of the taxilane; while the right path has parking spaces on the left and a larger ramp with some maintenance hangars on the right. Our parking space is on the right side.Before turning off Taxilane 1; we could see the tail and upper portion of a King Air at the far end of our parking row. Concerned that it might be running and heading our way (pilots don't always call for clearance before moving in the non-movement area); we proceeded cautiously; and determined that the King Air was not moving. As we came around the corner; we confirmed that the King Air was not running; and was attached to a tug; past the far end of the parking row where there is additional ramp space. The King Air and tug were stationary; so we proceeded at a normal taxi speed towards our parking space; which is about halfway down the row.Just before reaching our parking space; the tug began pulling the King Air down the taxilane; directly towards us. The tug driver; who was seated with his back towards us; was not looking where he was going; and apparently did not see us.Our only option was to take evasive action and move as quickly as possible into our parking space to the left. Stopping or turning right would have kept us in the tug's path. Fortunately; the parking spaces on either side of mine were empty; giving us some room to maneuver. I kept a close watch on the King Air's wing as we turned into the parking spaces; and was relieved to see that the tug was turning in the opposite direction; towards the maintenance hangars. By my estimate; we were never closer than about 20 feet; and were that close only for a moment.After we shut down; we saw a man standing in front of the airplane. As we got out; he approached me:Man: Are you the pilot?Me: Yes.Man: You need to show me your pilot's license!Me:	(Wondering if he is FAA or some other official) Who are you?Man: I am an employee of Company Y. That was an illegal and dangerous maneuver!Me:	(Understanding he has no authority) I'm sorry; but I'm not required to show you anything.Man: Fine; I'll just look up your tail number!Me: Ok; go right ahead.The man walked away. As we finished securing the airplane; the tug driver drove over on his tug. After exchanging pleasant greetings:Tug: I am the night shift manager; and if I ever catch you doing something like that again; I will call the FAA and have them ground you!Me: Ok; you're welcome to do whatever you like.Tug: This is a non-movement area. We don't call for clearance; and I couldn't see you!Me: You didn't have any wing-walkers?Tug: We don't do that until we get to the hangar. If you want to make this a contest; we're bigger than you! Who do you think will win? We have security cameras!Me: As I said; you're welcome to do whatever you like.The tug driver then drove away so abruptly that a pair of large chocks was thrown sideways off the back of the tug.As I review this incident; I cannot think of anything I could have done better. I saw the King Air before coming around the corner; proceeded cautiously; and was prepared to turn around and move out of the way if necessary. After finding that the King Air was attached to a tug and not moving; I proceeded towards my parking space at the standard 'brisk walk' taxi pace. By the time the tug started moving; there was no choice but to move quickly into the parking spaces. Stopping or turning around would have left us in his path and could have resulted in a collision.I have also reviewed the incident with my passenger; who is also a licensed pilot; and he hascome to the same conclusions.I am very concerned about the unsafe behavior of the tug driver. He did not clear the area before starting to move; and did not use wing-walkers or safety spotters. The Company X ramp is very busy; and is home to several flight schools and private operators; with light aircraft coming and going almost continuously during daylight hours. Vigilant caution and good situational awareness are essential for safety on this ramp.I am also concerned that the tug driver disregarded; or was perhaps unaware of; the FAA's ground movement right-of-way rules described in AC 150-5210-20A 'Ground Vehicle Operations to include Taxiing or Towing an Aircraft on Airports' and the 'FAA Guide to Ground Vehicle Operations;' both of which clearly state that aircraft have the right-of-way and ground vehicles must always yield to aircraft (unless directed otherwise by ATC; but this incident took place in a non-movement area). These rules require the tug driver to ensure that his operation will not interfere with aircraft movement; and require him to stop and yield to an aircraft if there is a potential conflict.This unsafe behavior is even more concerning in light of the hostile and threatening actions of both the tug driver and the other employee of Company Y; both of whom clearly demonstrated several of the FAA's 'hazardous attitudes.'Suggestions for improvement: Better education of mechanics and tug drivers on the ground handling right-of-way rules; emphasizing the importance of establishing and maintaining situational awareness (including using wing-walkers or safety spotters); and the requirement to yield to operating aircraft.",,,,"Cessna 152 pilot reported a conflict with a King Air aircraft under tow while taxiing into the ramp area requiring evasive action to avoid a possible collision.",

Then I looked all the instruments it was all in good condition. Then I woke my PIC and told him about the situation after that we decided that we will wait and observe the engine reaction for few minutes.

Then the approach gave us a phone number to call them as soon as we land. After three or four approaches my PIC made the short field landing as the airstrip was only 2000 ft.We landed there safely and contacted the approach through phone that we are safe and we are able to take off again. Then we took off from the airstrip and landed safely on the ZZZ2 because there was too much vibration on the engine. Then we contacted our school and told them about our situation. After that we dropped the aircraft to the FBO for maintenance and one of our instructor came us to pick up from ZZZ2.",,"Cessna 152 pilots reported engine RPM fluctuating during a training flight in VFR conditions and diverted to an airstrip.

I came to the United States to build hours and I have a temporary FAA PPL License. I am renting a Cessna 152 from Company that is based in ZZZ1. Yesterday; I was flying in Aircraft X (C152) for some cross country flights. I was the pilot flying and I had a safety pilot beside me who is also a ICAO CPL pilot with a temporary FAA PPL license. We both had above 180 hours. During my last leg which was from ZZZ2 to ZZZ1; I experienced an engine roughness. I was cruising at 5500 ft. on my way back to ZZZ1. I was cruising with 2300-2400 (recommended during cruise) and never above and the indicated airspeed was near 85. We don't know the exact indicated airspeed as we were told by the instructors to maintain RPM during cruise; not speed; because the horsepower on the 152 isn't big. As per the mixture; we set to towards the rich side of peak so that the engine would not be overheated. In addition; during the climb phase; we tried to cool the engine by climbing at speeds above Vy; Vx.Shortly after our aircraft's rpm dropped about 300 and fluctuated. The fluctuation became bigger and we know it wasn't just the indicator's problem because the airspeed was dropping and we felt the engine losing power. We instinctively had the mixture at full rich at full throttle. The engine power loss worsened so we conducted the engine failure checklist and looked for a nearby airport. The engine's rpm dropped to about 1400; which is idle during its windmilling state. The engine's rpm fluctuated from idle to 1800; and this fluctuation cycled a couple of times. With the rpm fluctuation being unstable; we were losing altitude and airspeed rapidly. In addition we weren't able to visually have contact with the nearest field; so we [requested priority handling]. We were barely in the glide range; however; because the engine was not reliable and we were approaching the runway with headwind; we felt that there was not enough safety margin to land without priority. We were given clearance to spiral down to ZZZ; Runway XX. We had to lose around 4000 ft. to land in ZZZ so we spiraled down. The engine came back on when we were descending to the runway so we advised the Tower the engine's back on but we'll make a precautionary landing just to be safe.",,"I am a ICAO CPL holder who has a temporary FAA PPL license.

MSL and receiving radar flight following to ZZZ1. When I was near another nearby airport; I had engine roughness issues which the engine RPM dropping to around 1400 RPM. That is when I decided that it would be best to divert to the nearest field. I advised the Approach that we would like to divert due to engine roughness problems. I was handed off to the Tower and I advised them of our situation and informed them we would make the landing from a left downwind entry. The ATC controller asked if we were [requesting priority handling]; however; since our engine wasn't completely dead; we did not [request priority handling].

The following day; I showed up to the airport without incident and performed a preflight inspection upon the inspection; I found my magneto cover; had been removed from the back of my magneto well two of the three bolts anyway; the third was hanging on by a couple of threads. I didn't think much about it at the time and I had the mechanic shop on site replace two bolts and tighten it down for me. I had the airport provide fuel through the service of the lineman. I finished my preflight inspection; and I departed ZZZ I had plenty of fuel to make the trip and back from ZZZ1. However; 20 minutes into the flight I look up at my fuel gauges and I'm on empty; called approach; and I told them I was deviating from the flight plan and I was going to land at ZZZ2. And that's what I did. Upon landing with the help of a couple of other pilots in the airport manager we determined that the screw keeping the universal vented fuel cap tight was backed out; essentially making it look like the fuel. Cap was functional; but in-flight allowed all of the fuel to spill out and then vacuumed it out of the other side.The airport had tools available and they provided them to me to fix the fuel cap after fixing the fuel cap I refilled the fuel tanks; and then flew a couple of laps around the pattern just for precautionary reasons; and then landed to check to make sure everything was OK after verifying that everything was in good condition I proceeded to my final destination ZZZ1.",,,,"Cessna 170 pilot reported a fuel leak during cruise in VMC conditions.

Instructor then did another full scan and realized that there was close proximity traffic at 3 o'clock departing ZZZ (aircraft X). They had already left delta airspace and were at a similar altitude. Instructor took controls and immediately started a climb.Looking back at how to better mitigate this risk; both instructor and student might have been too focused on trying to find the 9 o'clock traffic and may have not done a thorough job scanning for other traffic. There may have also been a blind spot issue looking for traffic at 3 o'clock earlier since it was at similar altitude. Usually tend to be lower for the arrival but hadn't initiated a descent down to 1500ft in order to look for the 9 o'clock traffic.

No anomalies were found during preflight. We performed a run-up on the ramp; got a clearance; and taxied to the assigned runway XXL. After stopping at the hold-short line I started performing the pre-takeoff checklist but was interrupted by tower instructing us to line up and wait on [runway] XXL ('Aircraft X runway XXL line-up and wait'). We taxied onto the runway and got our take-off clearance immediately after getting into position. I completed the checklist item I had started earlier and advanced the throttle for takeoff. After an uneventful climb and approximately 5 minutes of flight at cruise altitude (4500 feet MSL; 3500 feet AGL) at about 95kt TAS the aircraft performed an uncommanded and rather violent roll to the right and pitched up significantly. I instinctively pushed the yoke forward; leveled the wings; and ensured proper airspeed. I realized that the cause for this behavior was that the left door popped open. The Cessna 162 has wing doors that allow for easy entry and exit but require two door latches to be secured (one at the rear end and one at the front end). I realized that when allowing myself to be rushed into position on the runway I skipped part of the take-off checklist; which included checking that the second door latch is secured.We immediately turned back towards ZZZ and [advised ATC]. We were cleared for runway XL. The added drag of the open and bent door required us to trade altitude for speed even at full throttle. We managed to arrive at short final for [runway] XL with about 500 feet of altitude left. After a successful landing we taxied back to the hangar to evaluate the damage. The door was folded up halfway since the rear latch held (but eventually failed) while the front of the door opened due to the unsecured latch.I made the mistake of not completing the take-off checklist before entering the runway. I should have declined the line-up and wait instruction and instead go through the checklist items before contacting tower. The sense of urgency the received instruction conveyed led me to rush the normal take-off procedure. In the future I will decline such an instruction in the event that I am not fully ready for take-off yet; even if that causes a delay for my departure and the departure of following aircraft. More broadly; it is a reminder that I am responsible for the safety of the flight and have the right to decline any clearance and instruction provided by ATC to ensure a safe outcome.I realize that the unusual attitude training received during my recently completed primary training has helped me handle the situation once it arose.

(4-6. Cabin Door - CHECK [security and condition]) The doors were checked for condition and security; and everything was found in normal operating condition.  Just before takeoff I once again checked the doors on both sides as per CE-Skycatcher M162 POH; Sec. 4; pg. 4-18 (3. Cabin Doors - CLOSED and LOCKED) They appeared both to be closed and latched. I closed my door; and the passenger closed the door on his side as I instructed him. Furthermore; I told him to give the door a forearm 'bump' with his shoulder as I was taught by my instructor pilot to ensure closure.  The takeoff was uneventful; with normal performance; airspeed; and engine indication. During the climb phase up to pattern altitude the flight was normal; with no noises or vibrations from the doors. How it happened: The downwind was established at the local pattern altitude for ZZZZ as the airspeed increased and power reduced. Suddenly; a loud blowing noise was felt I immediately noticed my door (Left-hand) had opened and broken.  My first reaction was to fly the aircraft; the handling was somewhat difficult in my opinion (never had this happened before); and I was experiencing significant drag caused by the hanging door. At one point I added full throttle because the aircraft was losing altitude at a high rate.  At this point; I contacted the tower and [requested priority handling]. The Tower cleared me to land on Runway X. From that point; onward the approach and landing were uneventful and safe at XB22 (Z) local. In retrospect; I can't determine how this event occurred. I have several assumptions; first I did not secure the latching mechanism properly; although I emphasized the importance of locking and securing the door to the passenger which included the forearm bump. We both did it.  Second; the latching mechanism was probably locked but due to tear and wear and combined subtle airframe or engine vibration; it unlocked itself. (As a pilot with little experience I may not know how to assess that issue). Third; maybe the door alignment may have allowed airflow over the fuselage to force the latching mechanism to fail; case in point the event occurred while the aircraft was accelerating in the downwind phase. Or it failed as would any mechanical component.  After this experience; I will be more alert to checking the door latching mechanism more thoroughly during preflight. I will include two events of opening and closing to ensure it is operational and it feels like a tight latch. I will continue to use the checklist as taught.",,,,"C-162 pilot reported a cabin entry door opened in flight. Pilot returned to departure airport and landed.",

I thought about asking for change in the runway assignment to runway XY; but I could see the wind sock near the approach end and it didn't appear to show the same wind conditions as just announced. The sock showed a slower wind speed more closely aligned with runway XX. The three point landing was normal but very soon after touch down the plane started to turn to the right. Crosswind control settings did not correct the deviation and the right turn tightened to a ground loop. We stopped facing the opposite direction with the left wheel off the runway. Upon further inspection; the landing gear was still fully functional so we received permission from the tower to taxi back to the hangar with the safety vehicle following just in case we needed it. Lesson learned; I have always told myself that if a directional deviation began while landing to simply add power to reject the landing and go around. For some reason my mind was set that I had landed and I could recover from the tightening turn.Also; if a second runway is available and more closely aligned with the wind then take it.

They said 33 gallons. and I asked for them to check again. That seemed like a lot as I always plan to have 10 gallons left on landing and my records said I had only flown 3.5 hours on the tank (usually at 7.5-8 GPH)I preflight the aircraft; checked that fuel caps were on right; tested fuel and looked at the gauges in the wings - it seemed like they overfilled as the gauge was past the F mark.Takeoff was uneventful to VFR ontop and headed home to ZZZ1 expecting about 2 hrs 20 minutes enroute. I decided along the way to change my normal route from crossing on the west side (over Location A) of ZZZ2 Bravo because Approach seemed really busy lately and an east transition would make the load for them less; so as I approached ZZZ3; I turned to ZZZ4 and followed the route along the mountain east of the Valley.I could not get a Class Bravo clearance as I expected; so while at 6500; I saw I could hold that until I reached the north end of Bravo. I was about to begin descending to 4500 when the engine went to idle.I quickly checked the controls and fuel selector and looked at engine gauges. Saw no issues other than the RPM at idle;While over the Reservoir; I banked left to head towards known airports (I was based at ZZZ5 for 20 years and knew the area. ) Then I told ZZZ [TRACON] that engine was out. They advised either ZZZ6 or ZZZ5. I told them foreflight showed ZZZ5 was near the edge of my glide range and I was on my way.They asked for souls and fuel and I reported with one and likely 26 gallons based on flight time.I trimmed the plane all the way back to best glide and was transferred to Tower. I told them my intentions and gave them my home phone number in case. That just left me with the job of flying as I was cleared to land (anyplace) on [Runway] XXR.Good winds and nice glide left me at the end of [Runway] XXR very high; so used the 360 we are trained to use as part of our commercial training and then with a modest slip was able to place the plane on the runway with enough kinetic energy to coast onto the first taxiway. I was greeted by fire engines and operations. Tower asked if I could move the plane and I said only if I pushed it... They said just stay there.After a tow to the FBO; we looked for the reasons for fuel exhaustion as primary cause. The gauges looked like fuel (seemed weird) But visual examination proved the tanks were empty. Knowing I started full less than 2 hours before; we added fuel and searched for the leak. NONE.I called the FBO in ZZZ and told them what happened - their investigation determined they fueled the wrong plane!My examination of gauges (where E and F are next to each other) obviously is not enough. Nor is my timing my fueling unless I watch it go in the tanks. Future pre-flights will include finding a ladder to visually make sure the fuel got into my plane.I continued home; did a short flight to ZZZ7 to make sure the plane really had no issues and filled the tanks (I watched). As I left ZZZ7; I think I was still shaken a bit. as I came to the edge of 3000 ft Bravo floor to a 4000 ft floor; I transitioned to 3200 on my altimeter as I was trying to understand the busy controller's instructions. I was advised of that violation.

When the incident occurred; I was at a location near the VFR waypoint ZZZZZ; and was approximately 9 nautical miles from ZZZ. I announced my callsign; location; altitude; direction of flight; and intentions on the appropriate practice area frequency for the altitude I was at. I visually cleared the area and took note of the location of other aircraft that I either saw visually or heard their location over the radio. I did not perceive any conflicting traffic within the area and deemed it safe to commence the maneuver I intended to practice. I began one steep turn. Upon rollout from the turn; I spotted another aircraft that did not appear during my visual scan while clearing the area before the maneuver; flying close to my location; approximately 200 feet above and within close proximity horizontally; roughly 300 feet or less away. Aircraft Y was heading approximately directly towards my aircraft and direction of flight; to the point where I perceived a hazard. I immediately executed a sharp turn to the right to avoid the other aircraft. From what I recall; the other aircraft did not alter its flight direction to avoid the hazard. I did not hear this aircraft make radio calls to other air traffic.Regarding the cause of this event; I feel that it was a lack of awareness on the part of Aircraft Y. I do not believe the other aircraft saw my plane; given that it did not alter its flight path. The absence of radio calls from Aircraft  Y did not help the situation. Although radio calls are not a replacement for visual scans; they offer another tool for pilots to use in locating aircraft that may be difficult to see. If an announcement was made; it may have helped both of us avoid each other. However; it is possible that this aircraft may have been making radio calls. The ZZZ practice area has two frequencies to use. One frequency for operations at or below 2;000 feet and another for operations below 4;500 feet. It is possible that this aircraft may have been using the wrong frequency. I cannot say for certain since I was not monitoring the other practice area frequency at the time. This issue comes down to a need for more training regarding situational awareness and use of the radio as a safety tool; which I feel is very important when operating in areas with heavy traffic.",,,,"A VFR pilot maneuvering in a designated practice area reported a NMAC with an aircraft flying through the area.",
