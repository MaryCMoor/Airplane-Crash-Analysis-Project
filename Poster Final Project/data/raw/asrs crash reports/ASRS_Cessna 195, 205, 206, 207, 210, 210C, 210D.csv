I TOLD HIM IT WOULD TAKE AT LEAST 60-70 GALLONS AS I FELT I HAD ABOUT AN HR OF FUEL LEFT. HE QUESTIONED ME ON THIS AMOUNT AND I TOLD HIM IF IT WAS A PROB I COULD PROBABLY GET BY WITH ONLY 10 OR SO GALLONS. HE SAID WHEN HE GOT THE TRUCK THERE HE COULD PUMP AS MANY AS I WANTED. I SAID 'FINE' AND TOLD HIM TO COME ON AS I WAS READY AND HE SAID OK; I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. MY BROTHER AND I WALKED OUT TO THE PLANE AND WAITED FOR THE FUEL TRUCK.

I HAD TOLD THE LINE BOY TO FILL IT TO 1/4 INCH OF THE TOP SKIN OF THE WING BUT HE DID NOT. ( I CRUISE AT 12.5 GALLONS PER HR INCLUDING TKOF AND CLB.) WHEN I ARRIVED AT MIDDLETOWN FROM JACKSONVILLE ON XA NOV/XX/94 I CALLED UNICOM AND ASKED FOR FUEL -- I GOT NO ANSWER AND I DID NOT CALL LATER TO CONFIRM -- (MISTAKE). I WAS NOT PLEASED WITH X COMPANY DUE TO THEIR POOR INSTALLATION OF THE STORM SCOPE AND THIS COULD HAVE HAD A SMALL PERIPHERAL INFLUENCE.

ALTHOUGH IT WAS EVIDENT A XWIND COMPONENT WAS PRESENT; THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF THE SEVERE CTL PROBS THAT WOULD BE ENCOUNTERED ONCE ON THE GND. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: SURFACE WIND.

UNDER XWIND LNDGS IT SAYS; 'WHEN LNDG IN A STRONG XWIND; USE THE MINIMUM FLAPS SETTING REQUIRED FOR FIELD LENGTH' -- BUT THERE ARE NO CAUTIONS OR WARNINGS. I CONSIDERED THE XWIND MODERATE BUT NOT NECESSARILY STRONG. IN THIS SIT; A LESSER FLAP SETTING MAY HAVE BEEN A BETTER CHOICE; BUT I AM NOT CONVINCED IT WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE ACFT FROM WXVANING.

SINCE TKOF AT TPL I HAD NOTICED A PERSISTENT CHEMICAL SMELL. ABOUT 40 NM SSE OF DFW; I ALSO NOTICED THE LOW VOLTAGE LIGHT WOULD COME ON INTERMITTENTLY. I BEGAN A DETAILED LOOK AROUND COCKPIT AREA FOR POSSIBLE CAUSES. I DISCOVERED THAT WHEN THE LOW VOLTAGE LIGHT CAME ON; THE GEAR PUMP FOR THE LNDG GEAR WAS RUNNING. WHEN I LOOKED CLOSER AT THE GEAR SYS; I FOUND THAT FINE MIST OR FOG WAS COMING OUT FROM THE PANEL WHERE THE GEAR SELECTOR IS LOCATED. THIS MIST WAS THE CHEMICAL SMELL. I TRIED TO CYCLE THE GEAR TWICE TO SEE IF I COULD GET THE HYD FLUID TO QUIT SPRAYING OUT IN EITHER THE UP OR DOWN POS. IT DIDN'T STOP IN EITHER POS; AND THE AMOUNT OF FLUID SPRAYING OUT NOW APPEARED TO BE WORSE THAN BEFORE. I THEN FELT IT BEST TO PUT THE GEAR DOWN AND LEAVE IT DOWN; WHILE I STILL COULD. THE GEAR WENT DOWN AND SHOWED LOCKED (GREEN). I THEN DISCOVERED THAT; IF I PULLED THE GEAR CIRCUIT BREAKER; AS THE PRESSURE BLED OFF; THE FOG OF HYD FLUID WOULD EVENTUALLY STOP. AFTER ALL OF THIS; I RE-EVALUATED MY SIT AND DECIDED I WOULD TRY TO CALL APCH AND GET THEM TO LET ME DIVERT FROM HQZ TO ADS WHERE THERE WAS A REPAIR SHOP THAT I HAD USED BEFORE. WHEN I DID CALL APCH THEY SCOLDED ME FOR BEING INSIDE THE CLASS B AIRSPACE AT MY CRUISING ALT OF 5500 MSL. I MUST HAVE BEEN RIGHT ON THE BORDER OF THE CLASS B WHEN I FIRST CALLED; BECAUSE THE FIRST CTLRS POS ON ME WAS 2 NM SE OF LNC; WHICH WOULD PLACE ME 4 NM INSIDE CLASS B. IN BTWN MY FIRST CALL AND THE ABOVE POS; THE CTLR GAVE INSTRUCTIONS TO OTHER PLANES AND I NEEDED TO SET IN THE DISCRETE CODE IN THE XPONDER; WHICH MEANS AT LEAST 1-2 MINS ELAPSED. I FELT VERY BAD THAT A PLT WITH MY NUMBER OF TOTAL TIME AND EXPERIENCE WOULD LET THIS HAPPEN. I AM PARTICULARLY UPSET THAT I LET THE PROB DISTRACT ME TO THE EXTENT THAT IT AFFECTED MY BASIC FLYING SKILLS. IN ADDITION; AFTER LISTENING TO ATIS AT ADS; I STILL CAUGHT MYSELF MANEUVERING TO LAND ON THE WRONG RWY AT ADS. IN SUMMATION; I CAN NOW SEE HOW EXPERIENCED PLTS HAVE LET SMALL COCKPIT EMERS ESCALATE INTO BIG ACCIDENTS. I HAVE RELIVED IN MY MIND ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE TURNING OVER IN YOUR THOUGHTS AS THIS IS HAPPENING. WHAT DO I DO NOW? WHERE WILL I LAND? IS HYD FLUID FLAMMABLE? EVEN THOUGH THE GEAR SHOWED DOWN AND LOCKED; IS IT STILL LOCKED AFTER THE PRESSURE LEAKS OFF? WILL THE GEAR COLLAPSE? IS THE NOSE GEAR REALLY DOWN? (I CAN SEE THE MAINS). WHY IS THIS HAPPENING? WHAT CAUSED IT? ALL OF THE CTLRS AND TWR PERSONNEL WERE VERY HELPFUL AND CONCERNED DURING THE WHOLE INCIDENT. AS A POSTSCRIPT; THE FUSE PANEL ON THE CESSNA 210 IS LOCATED BY THE PLT'S L KNEE. 2 TIMES AFTER I PULLED THE CIRCUIT BREAKER ON THE GEAR PUMP; MY L KNEE BUMPED THE BREAKER BACK IN ENOUGH TO CAUSE THE FOG TO START ALL OVER AGAIN. THIS DIDN'T HELP MY CONCENTRATION ANY. I EXPERIENCED BURNING IN MY NOSE AND LIPS LATER; WHICH I ATTRIBUTE TO INHALING HYD FLUID.",,,,"SMA HAS HYD LEAK EMITTING CHEMICAL SPRAY INTO COCKPIT.

I ASKED FIRST FOR DENVER STAPLETON WX AND SPECIFICALLY ASKED IF THERE ARE ANY HOLDING INTO THE ARPT AND THEY SAID 'THERE WAS NO DELAY. SOME DELAYS THIS MORNING BUT AT THE CURRENT TIME THERE WAS NONE.' I THEN REQUESTED VARIOUS ARPTS N OF DENVER FOR POSSIBLE LOCATIONS TO LAND FOR FUEL. A NUMBER OF LOCATIONS WERE GIVEN AND I REQUESTED A CHANGE. AFTER RECEIVING DIRECT TO ARPT AND REQUESTED LOWER SINCE I WAS ONLY ABOUT 45 MI FROM LOCATION AT 21000 FT. AFTER A WHILE I WAS CLRED TO 20000 FT AND STOPPED A SHORT TIME AFTER THEN LOWERED TO 19000 FT; THEN AFTER A BRIEF TIME LOWER TO 18000 FT. I USED THE SPD BRAKES TO LOWER THE ALT EACH TIME WITH NO PWR REDUCTION SINCE I WAS ONLY DSNDING DOWN 1000 FT. THE PROC WAS AUTOPLT OFF (ALT HOLD) THEN PUT ON THE SPD BRAKES AND YOU WILL GET ABOUT 500 FT DSCNT RATE ABOUT 100 FT FROM THE TARGET ALT THEN YOU SIMPLY TURN OFF THE SPD BRAKES AND PRESS THE ALT HOLD BUTTON AND THE PLANE LEVELS OUT. THEN YOU CHK THE INST TO INSURE THE INTENDED RESULTS. I DID THIS PROC 3 TIMES FOR THE 3 DIFFERENT 1000 FT DSCNTS. THE FINAL DSCNT FROM 19000- 18000 FT WAS WHEN WE FLEW INTO A SCATTERED LAYER. THE SAME PROC WAS USED AND THE SPD BRAKES WERE TURNED OFF AND THE INDICATOR LIGHT WENT OUT AND THE ALT HOLD BUTTON ON THE AUTOPLT WAS ACTIVATED. THE PLANE DID NOT RESPOND AS IT DID JUST A FEW MIN AGO AND WE WERE STILL DSNDING EVEN THOUGH NONE OF SPD BRAKE INDICATORS INDICATED A PROB. THE ALT WAS STILL GOING DOWN BUT THE SPD BRAKES WERE OFF AND NO LIGHT WAS INDICATED. I STILL HAD 29 INCHES OF MANIFOLD PRESSURE DURING THE DSCNT SO I PITCHED UP THE ACFT AND TRIED TO MAINTAIN THE ASSIGNED ALT OF 18000 FT. THE PLANE WAS NOT RESPONDING BUT WITH CONSIDERABLE BACK PRESSURE AND AN INCREASE OF MANIFOLD PRESSURE I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN ALT BUT WAS VERY SLOW IN CLBING BACK TO 18000 FT. MY AIRSPD WAS SLOWLY DECREASING BECAUSE AS I FOUND OUT LATER THAT THE SPD BRAKES WERE FROZEN INTO THE UP (ON) POS CAUSING THE PLANE TO REDUCE SPD. IT APPEARED THAT WHEN I FLEW THROUGH A SMALL SCATTERED LAYER FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS THAT IT WAS ENOUGH TO FREEZE THE BRAKES IN THE ON POS. I TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO ATC WHEN WE DSNDED BELOW 18000 FT BY ABOUT 350 FT BEFORE I GAINED CTL OF THE ACFT. I TOLD HIM WHAT THE PROB WAS BUT IT WAS VERY HARD TO EXPLAIN AS I FOUND OUT LATER THAT HE HAD TAKEN ME THROUGH AN AL OF NUMEROUS PLANES IN HOLDING PATTERNS FOR DENVER. LOOKING BACK I MAY HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF TO DECLARE AN EMER BUT WITHOUT KNOWING THAT THE CTLR HAD TAKEN ME THROUGH A HOLDING PATTERN IT DID NOT SEEM NECESSARY. I FEEL THAT TAKING AN ACFT BTWN 18000 FT AND 17000 FT IS A MISTAKE. WE LOST ABOUT 150 FT JUST BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT ALTIMETER SETTINGS. SO EVEN IF I WERE ABLE TO STOP AT 18000 FT WE STILL COULD HAVE DEVIATED FROM THE SEPARATION OF 1000 FT. UPON ARRIVING HOME: SPD BRAKES WERE CHKED OUT BY MY MECH AND WAS FOUND IN SATISFACTORY CONDITION. CALLED SPD BRAKES COMPANY. OVER THE PHONE THEY STATED THAT THE SPD BRAKES WERE NOT TO BE USED IN ICING CONDITIONS. I TOLD THEM I FLEW INTO A SCATTERED AREA AND HE SAID THAT CAN DO IT. 'WHY IS THE PLANE NOT PLACARDED AGAINST FLYING INTO KNOWN ICING CONDITIONS WITH THE USE OF THE SPD BRAKES' AND HE SAID THERE IS NO PLACARD BUT IT IS IN THE SUPPLEMENT OF YOUR PLT OPERATING HANDBOOK. I ASKED HIM TO FAX OVER THE PAGES OF THE SUPPLEMENT AND ENCLOSED ARE COPIES OF THIS DOCUMENTATION. THERE IS ONLY 1 LINE THAT RESTRICTS FLT INTO ICE AND SINCE THIS CAN DRAMATICALLY AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ACFT I FEEL THIS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED FURTHER AND THE PLANE SHOULD BE PLACARDED FOR OTHER PLTS THAT MAY HAVE NOT SEEN THE 1 LINE ON THE SUPPLEMENT. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: IT APPEARS THE SPD BRAKES ARE A MODIFICATION AND SO THE INFO WOULD NOT APPEAR IN THE PLT OPERATING HANDBOOK.

THIS REQUEST WAS PRECIPITATED BY THE FACT THAT ADDITIONAL TFC HAD JUST REQUESTED TO PRACTICE TOUCH AND GO'S ON RWY 2. I AGREED TO THE REQUEST; HOWEVER; THE CLRNC NOT ONLY INCLUDED MY LNDG ON RWY 33; BUT ALSO REQUESTED THAT I HOLD SHORT OF RWY 2. I WAS SOMEWHAT HIGH AT THE TIME; AND UNFORTUNATELY WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH THE ARPT; SO I DID NOT UNDERSTAND JUST HOW LIMITED THE RWY WOULD BE IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THIS REQUEST. SHARP TURNS AT LOW ALT WERE REQUIRED TO REPOS MYSELF TO RWY 33; AND AS I TURNED ONTO A VERY SHORT FINAL; I SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE RWY SHORT OF RWY 2; WAS VERY LIMITED. I SHOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY TOLD THE TWR THAT I WOULD BE UNABLE TO LAND AND ALSO HOLD SHORT AS REQUESTED; HOWEVER; THAT'S HINDSIGHT. IN REALITY I ATTEMPTED THE LNDG; ONLY TO FLOAT FOR WHAT SEEMED FOREVER. ONCE ON THE GND; I IMMEDIATELY APPLIED MAX BRAKING; BUT AT THAT MOMENT THE ACFT SWERVED L; AND I WAS TEMPORARILY OUT OF CTL; AND VERY CLOSE TO A GND LOOP. I WAS FORTUNATE TO REGAIN CTL; AND TO STOP JUST SHORT OF RWY 2 AS REQUESTED; BUT I HAD COME VERY CLOSE TO LEAVING THE RWY OUT OF CTL. THE LOSS OF CTL PROBABLY OCCURRED BECAUSE IN MY HASTE TO LAND; I WAS CARRYING TOO MUCH SPD. WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO APPLY THE BRAKES; I RELAXED THE XWIND CTL WHICH WAS REQUIRED FOR THIS RWY AND APPLIED THE BRAKES UNEVENLY. THIS CAUSED THE TEMPORARY LOSS OF CTL. OBVIOUSLY THIS WAS PLT ERROR; AND PERHAPS THIS WILL BE A GOOD LESSON TO ME THAT IF I SEE A SIT DEVELOPING; I SHOULD NOT HESITATE TO TELL THE TWR THAT I AM UNABLE TO COMPLY. HOWEVER; THERE ARE SEVERAL CONTRIBUTING FACTORS THAT HAVE CAUSED ME TO SEND THIS RPT. FIRST; WHY WAS I SO HIGH ON APCH? THIS HAS BEEN A CONSTANT PROB ON ALMOST EVERY VISIT TO THIS ARPT. I GENERALLY MAKE MY FLT IFR; AND ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION; ATC DELAYS THE DSCNT UNTIL IT IS RUSHED AT BEST; AND IMPOSSIBLE AT TIMES TO REACH THE ARPT AT PATTERN ALT. VFR DSCNTS ARE NOT ALLOWED WHILE ON AN IFR FLT PLAN; AND WITH THE NUMEROUS TRAINING FLTS AT THIS ARPT; ATC SEEMS TO HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME GETTING TFC DOWN IN A TIMELY FASHION. SEEING THIS WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN TO ME AGAIN; I CANCELED IFR AND PROCEEDED VFR TO THE ARPT; HOWEVER; BECAUSE OF RADIO TFC; I WAS A LITTLE LATE IN CANCELING; AND HENCE THE HIGHER THAN NORMAL APCH. HOWEVER; THIS APCH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A PROB WITH THE FULL RWY LENGTH AVAILABLE TO ME; IT ONLY BECAME A PROB WHEN REQUESTED TO USE ONLY PARTIAL RWY LENGTH. ADDITIONALLY; I QUESTION THE JUDGEMENT OF THE TWR CTLR ASKING ME TO REPOS TO ANOTHER RWY; WHEN I HAD BEEN CLRED TO LAND; AND WAS ON A 1 MI FINAL. IF THIS HAD BEEN AN EMER THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE THING; BUT IT WAS JUST ANOTHER ACFT PRACTICING IN THE PATTERN. MUCH BETTER WOULD HAVE BEEN TO ASK THE OTHER ACFT TO LAND ON RWY 33. AS IT WAS; I WAS ASKED TO EXECUTE SHARP TURNS AT LOW ALT AND SLOW AIRSPD TO EFFECT THE MANEUVER; AND THAT IS POOR PRACTICE. FURTHER; WHEN I WAS ASKED IF I WOULD BE WILLING TO LAND ON RWY 33; NO MENTION WAS MADE THAT I WOULD ALSO BE ASKED TO HOLD SHORT OF RWY 2. I MIGHT HAVE HESITATED TO ACCEPT THE REQUEST IF I HAD UNDERSTOOD THE ENTIRE REQUEST. THE CTLR WHO IS FAMILIAR WITH HIS ARPT SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME HIGH; AND UNDERSTOOD THAT HOLDING SHORT WOULD BE A PROB; IN MY OPINION. THIS INCIDENT WOULD HAVE BEEN MY FAULT; HOWEVER; I BELIEVE THE ACTIONS OF THE TWR SHOWED POOR JUDGEMENT; AND CONTRIBUTING IS THE ATTITUDE OF ATC THAT ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION; DELAYS DSCNTS COMING FROM THE E UNTIL A SANE RATE OF DSCNT IS DIFFICULT. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR REPEATED THE FACT THAT EVERY TIME HE FLIES INTO SAF HE GETS A SLAM DUNK APCH. COMING FROM THE E; HE IS HELD AT 13000 FT AS THE MEA ON V-62 IS 10000. HE HAS TRIED REQUESTING A VMC DSCNT AND WAS TOLD IT WASN'T AUTH. HE HAS TO CANCEL IFR TO GET DOWN IN TIME AND IS STILL HIGH. HE HAS NEVER BEEN GIVEN A 'CLRED FOR THE APCH' BUT RECEIVES A 'CLRED FOR THE VISUAL; USUALLY WHEN ABOUT 5-6 MI FROM THE VORTAC. HE FLIES A TURBO 210. WHEN QUESTIONED; HE STATED THAT; 'NO; HE HASN'T TALKED WITH THE FACILITY CHIEF AND SHOULD HAVE. HE THOUGHT THAT THE REASON THE RWY CHANGE WAS REQUESTED WAS THAT A 'WARBIRD;' AN OLD GRUMMAN TBF; WAS ON DOWNWIND AND THE CTLR WISHED TO GIVE THAT ACFT PRIORITY FOR RWY 33.",,,,"LOSS OF ACFT CTLR DURING LNDG PROC ROLLOUT.

THEN AGAIN ON FINAL TO REDUCE SPD TO 80 KIAS. IN THE PROCESS I BECAME SO TRANSFIXED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SPD BRAKES THAT I NEGLECTED TO LOWER MY LNDG GEAR AND COMPETED A PERFECT (VERY SLOW) LNDG. I SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT AFTER REDUCING PWR I DID NOT HEAR A GEAR UP HORN AND DO NOT BELIEVE IT SOUNDED UNTIL AFTER I CAME TO A STOP ON THE RWY. I ACTUALLY DIDN'T THINK I HAD LANDED GEAR UP; BUT INITIALLY THOUGHT THAT MY PROP HAD STRUCK SOMETHING ON THE RWY.

IT WAS A HVY; WET SNOW; UNUSUAL FOR NEW MEXICO; THAT CONTINUED TO FALL LIGHTLY DURING PREFLT; BUT WHICH CAME OFF THE ACFT EASILY. AFTER ENG START; I GOT MY CLRNC AND DID A RUNUP THAT INCLUDED A VISUAL CHK OF THE HORIZ STABILIZER AND ELEVATOR. THEY BOTH APPEARED TO BE CLEAN. THERE WAS NO DELAYS IN TAXIING TO RWY 8.

IN MY MEMORY; I REMEMBER NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND THE APCH PLATES; EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE ON THE FLOOR BESIDE ME. I HAD BOTH AN APCH CERTIFIED GPS; RNAV AND MOVING MAP AND YET I WAS CONFUSED AS TO WHERE I WAS GOING. I ADVISED CTR THAT I WOULD TURN TOWARD THE ARPT WHEN I COULD SET MY GPS AND TAKE SOME TIME TO SORT OUT WHERE I WAS. I TRIED 3 TIMES TO SET KMVN INTO THE GPS IN THE ROUGH AIR -- EVEN THOUGH BOTH IT AND THE MOVING MAP OFFERED A 'KAREST' FUNCTION -- WHICH I NEVER THOUGHT TO USE. I WAS CLRLY CONFUSED AS TO WHAT TO DO AND PANIC BEGAN TO SET IN. I ADVISED ATC THAT I WAS GOING TO PROCEED GPS DIRECT TO THE ARPT AND I BELIEVED THAT I COULD OBTAIN A VISUAL; CANCEL IFR AND PROCEED VFR; IF THAT DIDN'T WORK I'D GO TO PLAN B. DURING THIS EXCHANGE A COMMUTER WAS HELD FROM DEP. FORTUNATELY AT 2800 FT MSL; I WAS ABLE TO ACQUIRE THE ARPT VISUALLY AT 10 O'CLOCK AND 3 MI AND COMPLETE THIS APCH VISUALLY.

I HAD BOTH A GPS APPROVED RECEIVER AND APCH PLATES; BUT I COULDN'T SEEM TO TUNE THE GPS; MUCH LESS THINK THROUGH WHAT WAS HAPPENING. UPON LNDG; I DISCOVERED MY CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTOR WAS JET BLACK. I NOW SUSPECT THAT I MAY HAVE BEEN SUFFERING DISORIENTATION AS A RESULT OF CARBON MONOXIDE EXPOSURE. MY ACFT IS SUBJECT TO AN EXHAUST CHK AT EACH 50 HRS; AND I AM JUST AT THAT POINT WITH THIS FLT FOR A RECHK. IF THAT IS NOT THE CAUSE; THEN I AM BAFFLED.

HIS ACFT; A CESSNA TURBO 210; HAS SEVERAL NOTICES REGARDING CARBON MONOXIDE LEAKS IN THE HEATER SYS. THIS HEATER FITS AROUND THE EXHAUST SHROUD. THE LCL FBO CHKED THE ACFT FOR CARBON MONOXIDE LEAKAGE; BUT NONE WAS FOUND. THE PLT SUSPECTS THAT THE TURB HE WAS EXPERIENCING AT THE TIME MAY HAVE CAUSED SOME OF THE FLEXIBLE DUCT JOINTS TO OPEN ALLOWING CARBON MONOXIDE TO BE INGESTED INTO THE CABIN AIR HEATER.

I WAS SETTING UP FOR A HIGH AND STEEP APCH AS I TURNED ABOUT 1 1/2 MI FINAL TO REMAIN WELL ABOVE ANY WAKE TURB. AS I ROLLED OUT ON FINAL APCH I DID MY GUMPS CHK; CHKING THE FUEL SELECTOR; LOWERING THE GEAR LEVER; SETTING THE MIXTURE TO RICH AND THE PROP FULL FORWARD. AT THIS POINT I WAS CONCENTRATING ON MAINTAINING A GLIDE PATH WELL ABOVE THAT USED BY THE BOEING AND I WAS TRYING TO DETERMINE HIS TOUCHDOWN POINT SO AS TO LAND WELL PAST THAT POINT. AS I FLARED FOR TOUCHDOWN I HEARD AN UNUSUAL NOISE AND KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG. THE ACFT SEEMED TOO LOW AND I FELT THE ACFT SLIDE ONTO THE RWY. I LOOKED DOWN AT THE SAFE GEAR INDICATOR AND SAW THAT IT WAS NOT LIT. AS THE ACFT SLID TO A HALT I PULLED THE MIXTURE; TURNED THE FUEL SELECTOR OFF AND TURNED OFF THE MASTER SWITCH. I THEN LEFT THE ACFT. I SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT NO GEAR WARNING SOUNDED AND AFTERWARDS I NOTICED THE LNDG GEAR CIRCUIT BREAKER HAD POPPED; ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW IF IT POPPED WHEN I LOWERED THE GEAR LEVER OR UPON LNDG. IN REGARDS TO HUMAN PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS THE FAILURE TO CHK THE SAFE GEAR INDICATION AFTER LOWERING THE GEAR WAS AN ERROR; HOWEVER THE FAILURE OF THE GEAR WARNING HORN CONTRIBUTED TO THE SIT. ALSO AFFECTING THE SIT WAS MY TOTAL CONCENTRATION ON AVOIDING THE WAKE TURB. THIS WAS THE RESULT OF AN ENCOUNTER A COUPLE WKS EARLIER THAT SCARED ME PRETTY BAD AND GAVE ME GREATLY BOOSTED RESPECT FOR THE PWR OF WAKE TURB. ALSO; MARITAL PROBS AND AN IMPENDING DIVORCE COULD BE CONSIDERED IN REGARD TO QUALITY OF HUMAN PERFORMANCE AS THAT HAS BEEN IN THE BACK OF MY MIND A LOT LATELY.

DURING MAP PLT NOTICED THAT THE ILS RECEIVED HAD CHANGED FREQ AND BOTH NEEDLES STILL CTRED; NO RED FLAGS; BOTH PLTS CONFIRMED THE CONDITION. THE FOLLOWING APCH WAS SUCCESSFUL IN EVERY WAY. NO IDENTIFIABLE EXPLANATION FOR THE FREQ CHANGE. THE 'NEW' FREQ WAS NOT THE STANDBY FREQ. I; THE INSTRUCTOR; RELAYED THE EVENT TO SENIOR PLTS OF THE LCL AIRLINE. 2 WKS LATER THEY NOTED A SIMILAR UNCOMMANDED FREQ CHANGE ON A COM FREQ. WITH THE RPTED 20 DEGS 13 KT L XWIND; X ALLOWED THE AIRPLANE TO DRIFT TO WHERE -- ON THE GS AT 400 FT ALT AND STILL IN THE SOUP -- THE LOC NEEDLE WAS OFF SCALE. WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO EXECUTE A MAP. THE RADAR OPERATOR APOLOGIZED FOR TURNING US ON TO THE LOC A BIT TOO CLOSE- IN AND ADVISED THAT THIS TIME HE WOULD POS US ABOUT 12 MI OUT. PRIOR TO OUR SECOND APCH; X WENT THROUGH THE PRE- LNDG CHKS AGAIN; FUEL REMAINING; 2 HRS; FREQS STILL SET; ALL SYS OPERATING AS EXPECTED. THE RADAR OPERATOR POSITIONED US AT 13 MI FROM THE ARPT; AND WE INTERCEPTED THE LOC AT A COMFORTABLE 30 DEG ANGLE. WE INTERCEPTED THE GS AT THE OM; X LOWERED THE LNDG GEAR AND STARTED DOWN TOWARD THE PUBLISHED DECISION HT OF 225 FT MSL. CONSTANTLY MONITORING THE PLT'S ACTIONS; THE INST PANEL AND OCCASIONALLY OUT THE WINDOWS; I WAS VERY PLEASED THAT X HAD THE LOC AND GS NEEDLES PERFECTLY CTRED -- THIS WAS A VERY GOOD APCH. AS X CALLED OFF THE REMAINING ALT: '400 FT TO GO;' '300 FT TO GO;' '200 FT TO GO;' I LOOKED AHEAD AND STILL COULD SEE NOTHING BUT GREY CLOUDS -- THEN LOOKING DOWN; OUT MY R SIDE WINDOW; I NOTICED TREES ABOUT 100 FT BELOW JUST AS WE CROSSED THE INDIAN OCEAN SHORELINE. 'GAR' I COMMANDED; AND APPLIED FULL THROTTLE. X RESPONDED BY RETRACTING THE LNDG GEAR AND AS EVERY GOOD PLT IS TAUGHT CONTINUED TO 'FLY THE AIRPLANE.' THROUGHOUT ALL OF THIS; BOTH THE ILS NEEDLES WERE PERFECTLY CTRED; THEN X SAID 'LOOK; THE ILS RECEIVER HAS CHANGED FREQ.' SURE ENOUGH; INSTEAD OF 110.3 WHERE IT HAD BEEN SET AND CONFIRMED; THE ILS RECEIVER READ 110.7 AND THERE WERE NO RED FLAGS TO INDICATE A NON-SERVICEABLE SIGNAL. FOR THE THIRD APCH; BOTH X AND I CAREFULLY RESET THE ILS FREQ; CONFIRMED ALL THE SETTINGS AND IDENTS AND ASKED FOR ANOTHER 12 OR 15 MI POSITIONING TO INTERCEPT THE LOC. IN NEARLY 50 YRS OF FLYING I HAD NEVER SEEN RADIOS CHANGE FREQS 'BY THEMSELVES' IE; UNTOUCHED -- OH YES IN 'THE OLD DAYS' I AND OTHERS OCCASIONALLY BUMPED THE KNOBS AND DE- TUNED A RECEIVER -- BUT NONE OF THAT SINCE DIGITAL FREQ SETTINGS IMPROVED OUR LIVES. THE MESSAGE IS CLR; KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN AND BE READY FOR ANYTHING. I DESCRIBED OUR 'FREQ CHANGE PROB' AND THE ACCOMPANYING CIRCUMSTANCES TO ONE OF THE SENIOR CAPTS AT ACR Y.

JUST 2 WKS LATER IN MID-JAN; THEY WERE AT CRUISE ALT IN AN ATR42 BTWN LUSAKA; ZAMBIA; AND LILONGWE; MALAWI; WHEN HE NOTICED THE TENTHS DIGIT (POINT X) ON THE STANDBY FREQ OF THEIR X COM RECEIVER 'ROLLING UPWARD' IE; POINT 1; POINT 2; POINT 3; POINT 4; ETC.

I ENTERED 7600 ON THE XPONDER AND TRIED 2 RADIO XMISSIONS TO ZMA WITHOUT REPLY. THE XPONDER CEASED TO REPLY ABOUT 5 MINS LATER. AFTER CONSIDERING ALL ALTERNATIVES; I CONCLUDED THAT THE BEST AND SAFEST DECISION WAS TO CONTINUE TO EYW WHICH WAS CLRLY VISIBLE; WHERE I WAS EXPECTED AND WHERE I ANTICIPATED MY ARR AT EYW WOULD BE KNOWN SINCE MY INTENTIONS WOULD BE UNAMBIGUOUS; ZMA WAS AWARE OF MY COM PROBS AND COULD FOLLOW MY PROGRESS TO EYW.

LNDG CLRNCS TYPICALLY CONTAIN A 'HOLD SHORT' INSTRUCTION; REQUIRING A FULL STOP PRIOR TO REACHING THE INTERSECTING RWY. PLT HAS SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTED SUCH 'LAND AND HOLD SHORT' INSTRUCTIONS AT BURBANK ON OVER 100 OCCASIONS. IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE; PLT WAS CLRED TO LAND ON RWY 8; WITH AN INSTRUCTION TO 'HOLD SHORT' OF RWY 15. A STRONG XWIND WAS PRESENT ON RWY 8 (THEN CURRENT ATIS AT BUR STATED WINDS OUT OF 140 DEGS AND 12 KTS). PLT EXECUTED A NORMAL; STABILIZED APCH TO LNDG ON RWY 8; BUT ENCOUNTERED A STRONG XWIND GUST ON FLAREOUT (BELIEVED TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY STRONGER THAN 12 KTS); CAUSING THE ACFT TO LAND HARD ON ONE WHEEL AND TO BOUNCE. PLT ATTEMPTED TO CORRECT BUT; IN PLT'S JUDGEMENT; HAD EXCESSIVE DRIFT DUE TO THE GUSTY XWINDS TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THE LNDG ON RWY 8. THUS; AS HE HAD BEEN TRAINED TO DO; PLT ABORTED THE LNDG ATTEMPT; APPLIED FULL PWR AND EXECUTED A GAR. PLT ANNOUNCED THE GAR TO THE TWR IMMEDIATELY UPON DECIDING TO DO SO. PLT'S ACFT CROSSED THE INTXN WITH RWY 15 WHILE CLBING AT APPROX 50 FT AGL. PLT THEN WAS CLRED TO LAND ON RWY 15 AND DID SO WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. AFTER LNDG; PLT WAS ADVISED BY THE TWR THAT ANOTHER ACFT HAD BEEN CLRED FOR TKOF ON RWY 15 AND; BECAUSE OF THE GAR; HAD TO ABORT THE TKOF. PLT WAS ADVISED THAT THE DEPARTING ACFT ON RWY 15 WAS ABLE TO COME TO A FULL STOP PRIOR TO REACHING THE INTXN OF RWY 8. NONETHELESS; AS THE TWR CTLR EXPLAINED (AND AS PLT ACKNOWLEDGES) THERE WAS CLRLY THE POTENTIAL FOR A DISASTROUS TFC CONFLICT ARISING OUT OF PLT'S FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE THE 'HOLD SHORT' INSTRUCTION. PLT NONETHELESS BELIEVES THAT; GIVEN HIS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SAFETY OF HIS PAX AND HIMSELF; HE HAD NO ALTERNATIVE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT TO ABORT THE LNDG AND EXECUTE THE GAR. ON INITIAL CONTACT WITH SOCAL APCH; APPROX 15 MI OUT; PLT REQUESTED A STRAIGHT-IN TO RWY 15 AND WAS SEQUENCED TO LAND #2 ON STRAIGHT-IN APCH TO RWY 15. AFTER HDOF TO BUR TWR; PLT WAS INITIALLY TOLD THAT HE WAS #2 FOR LNDG ON RWY 15. APPROX 3 MI OUT; HOWEVER; TWR REQUESTED PLT TO MAKE L BASE FOR LNDG ON RWY 8. IN RETROSPECT; GIVEN PLT'S KNOWLEDGE THAT WINDS STRONGLY FAVORED RWY 15 FOR LNDG AND PLT'S RELATIVELY LOW TIME IN ACFT TYPE; PLT PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE REJECTED THE LNDG CLRNC ON RWY 8 AND INSISTED ON A CLRNC TO LAND ON RWY 15. PLT'S CONFIDENCE IN HIS XWIND LNDG ABILITIES AND DESIRE NOT TO DISRUPT THE FLOW OF TFC INTO A BUSY ARPT PROBABLY SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO OVERRIDE HIS EARLIER JUDGEMENT THAT LNDG ON RWY 15 WAS THE BEST AND SAFEST COURSE OF ACTION. IN PLT'S VIEW 'SIMULTANEOUS OPS' ON INTERSECTING RWYS SHOULD NOT NECESSARILY INCLUDE ISSUANCE OF SIMULTANEOUS CLRNCS ON THE INTERSECTING RWYS WITHOUT REGARD FOR POTENTIAL TFC CONFLICTS. PARTICULARLY WHERE A CTLR IS AWARE OF A SIGNIFICANT XWIND OR OTHER POTENTIALLY ADVERSE LNDG CONDITIONS ON ONE OF THE INTERSECTING RWYS; IT SEEMS THAT THE CTLR SHOULD AT LEAST WAIT UNTIL THE LNDG ACFT IS OBSERVED TO BE SAFELY ON THE GND AND ROLLING OUT BEFORE ISSUING A TKOF CLRNC ON THE INTERSECTING RWY. IT SEEMS THAT THE FEW SECONDS TO BE SAVED BY OMITTING THIS STEP ARE HARDLY WORTH THE RISKS INVOLVED. PLT HAD ONLY ABOUT 8 HRS TOTAL TIME IN CESSNA 210 AND HAD NEVER LANDED THAT PARTICULAR ACFT IN A SUBSTANTIAL XWIND. ANOTHER POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTING FACTOR; IN RETROSPECT; WAS PLT FATIGUE. THE SUBJECT INCIDENT OCCURRED AT THE CONCLUSION OF A 1 HR AND 40 MIN XCOUNTRY FLT RETURNING FROM A SKI TRIP; WHERE PLT HAD BEEN SKIING FOR APPROX 4 HRS ON THE MORNING OF THE INCIDENT. HAD PLT GOTTEN MORE REST AFTER ENGAGING IN STRENUOUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY; HIS FLYING SKILLS MAY WELL HAVE BEEN A BIT SHARPER AND UP TO WHAT PROVED TO BE DEMANDING SIT. SUGGESTION: THERE IS NO REASON WHY ARPTS CONDUCTING SIMULTANEOUS OPS ON INTERSECTING RWYS SHOULD BE INHERENTLY MORE DANGEROUS THAN OTHERS. NONETHELESS; CTLRS SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT AS LNDG CONDITIONS ON ONE OF THE INTERSECTING RWYSBECOME INCREASINGLY ADVERSE; DUE TO XWINDS OR OTHER FACTORS; THE MARGIN OF SAFETY SHOULD BE CORRESPONDINGLY INCREASED. ALTHOUGH THIS PLT HAS LEARNED THE HARD WAY; FROM EXPERIENCE; IT IS SUGGESTED THAT EFFORTS BE MADE TO EDUCATE PLTS ABOUT USING ARPTS CONDUCTING SIMULTANEOUS OPS ON INTERSECTING RWYS. PLTS SHOULD BE MADE AWARE THAT ACCEPTANCE OF A 'LAND AND HOLD SHORT' CLRNC CAN RESULT IN THEIR HAVING VERY LIMITED OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM ONCE THEY ARE OVER THE RWY THRESHOLD. PLTS SHOULD BE REMINDED THAT; AS THE ONES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFETY OF THEIR PAX; THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED TO ACCEPT SUCH A 'LAND AND HOLD SHORT' CLRNC ON A RWY WITH UNFAVORABLE LNDG CONDITIONS BUT THAT THEY SHOULD INSIST ON A CLRNC TO LAND ON THE MORE FAVORABLE RWY IF THEIR BETTER JUDGEMENT TELLS THEM TO DO SO.",,,,"AFTER ACCEPTING A 'LAND AND HOLD SHORT' CLRNC; THE RPTR BOUNCED A C210 WHILE LNDG IN A XWIND AND EXECUTED A GAR.

THE FIRST LEG OF THE TRIP WAS FROM NAPA TO ELKO; NV; AND WAS JUST BEAUTIFUL. IT WAS STILL BEAUTIFUL WHEN I TOOK OFF FROM ELKO SO I THOUGHT MAYBE I WOULD GO DIRECT TO CHEYENNE RATHER THAN CONTINUE ON V6. I GLANCED AT THE WAC CHART; NOTICED THE LUCIN MOA THAT I WAS GOING TO PASS THROUGH AND THEN MY ATTN WAS DRAWN TO THE SLC CLASS B AIRSPACE. I WAS AT 13500 FT SO WOULD BE ABOVE IT; THEN THOUGHT I SHOULD PROBABLY CALL THEM ANYWAY AND LET THEM KNOW THAT I WANTED TO OVERFLY THEIR AIRSPACE. I LOOKED AT THE WAC CHART FOR AN APCH FREQ BUT COULDN'T FIND ONE. I BECAME ABSORBED IN FINDING A FREQ FOR CONTACTING SLC APCH AND SINCE MY WAC CHART DIDN'T HAVE IT; I PUT IT ASIDE. I CONTACTED SLC APCH AND RECEIVED FLT FOLLOWING WHILE ABOVE THE CLASS B AIRSPACE. ONCE PAST CLASS B THE CTLR SUGGESTED GOING AROUND ON THE WAY BACK SINCE IT WAS A BUSY PLACE.

MOREOVER; THE NEXT TIME I PLAN A FLT I WILL NOT ONLY USE A MARKER TO OUTLINE MY FLT; I'LL ALSO USE ANOTHER COLOR TO DRAW ATTN TO ANY RESTR OR SUA SO THAT IT STANDS OUT AT A GLANCE. BEYOND THAT; I WOULD TREAT THE DECISION TO GO DIRECT AS A REVISION TO MY FLT PLAN AND LINE IT OUT ON THE CHART. OBVIOUSLY A QUICK GLANCE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT.

THE BAD NEWS IS THAT I GOT ABSORBED IN THE ACTIVITY OF CONTACTING SLC APCH BEFORE I PROPERLY REVIEWED THE IMPACT OF MY FLT PLAN CHANGE. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT I KNOW HOW TO AVOID A REPETITION.

AFTER LISTENING TO ATIS; I CONTACTED ARB TWR ABOUT 10 NM SW IN PREPARATION FOR LNDG. ABOUT THAT TIME I NOTICED THE DME HAD STOPPED WORKING. WHILE CHKING THAT OUT; I NOTICED THAT THE ALTERNATOR CIRCUIT BREAKER HAD 'POPPED.' I RPTED TO ARB TWR THAT WE HAD LOST OUR ALTERNATOR; WHICH THEY ACKNOWLEDGED; AND ASKED IF WE NEEDED ASSISTANCE. I MOVED THE LNDG GEAR SWITCH TO 'DOWN;' THE GEAR CAME DOWN AND APPEARED LOCKED. HOWEVER; ALL INDICATIONS OF ELECTRICAL PWR WERE MISSING. I ATTEMPTED TO LOWER THE FLAPS FOR LNDG; BUT THEY DID NOT RESPOND PROPERLY. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF ELECTRICAL FIRE; SO I RESET THE ALTERNATOR CIRCUIT BREAKER. THE ALTERNATOR DID NOT RESPOND. BY THAT TIME I WAS ON SHORT FINAL; WITH NO AVAILABLE ELECTRICAL PWR. THE LNDG WAS UNEVENTFUL. AFTER TAXIING TO THE T-HANGAR; I HEARD THE LNDG GEAR MOTOR TRYING TO RUN; BUT NOT HAVING ENOUGH PWR TO DO SO. AFTER EXITING THE AIRPLANE; I NOTICED THE LNDG GEAR DOORS WERE STILL OPEN. SINCE I HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH TWR SINCE ON FINAL; I TELEPHONED THEM TO DISCUSS THE EVENT. THEY WERE VERY HELPFUL; AND SAID THERE WAS NOTHING FURTHER I NEED TO DO ABOUT IT WITH THEM. AFTER CHARGING THE BATTERY; A VERY CAREFUL CHK OF THE AIRPLANE AND ITS SYS REVEALED NO PROBS. AS BEST I CAN TELL; I OVERLOADED THE ELECTRICAL SYS WHICH CAUSED THE ALTERNATOR CIRCUIT BREAKER TO 'POP.' I DID NOT NOTICE THIS HAD HAPPENED UNTIL THE BATTERY HAD BEEN RUN DOWN SUCH THAT IT COULD NOT SUPPLY ENERGIZING PWR TO THE ALTERNATOR.

ONE ACFT LANDED DURING MY RUN-UP; FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER AS I POSITIONED MY ACFT TO VIEW BASE AND FINAL. AS THE SECOND ACFT ROLLED DOWN THE RWY; I VISUALLY SCANNED BASE AND FINAL. AS I HAD HEARD NO OTHER ACFT POS RPTS SINCE THE ACFT JUST LNDG HAD CALLED FINAL; AND SEEING NO TFC ON BASE OR FINAL; I ANTICIPATED I COULD DEPART AS SOON AS THE ACFT ON THE RWY WAS CLR. SO; I ANNOUNCED MY INTENTION ON CTAF 'TO TAKE RWY 22 FOR DEP.' I APPLIED PWR AND TURNED THE ACFT BACK TOWARD TXWY CTRLINE AND CROSSED THE HOLD LINE; WHILE DIRECTING MY ATTN TO THE ACFT ON THE RWY. ALTHOUGH THIS ACFT WAS NOW ABOUT 1/2 WAY DOWN THE RWY IT APPEARED THAT HE WAS TOO FAST FOR A TURNOFF AND NOT YET FAST ENOUGH TO BE DOING A TOUCH AND GO. AS I LINED UP ON THE ACTIVE; THIS ACFT WAS STILL ON THE RWY; SO I DELAYED APPLYING PWR TO WAIT FOR HIM TO CLR THE RWY OR BECOME AIRBORNE. HE FINALLY CALLED 'ON THE GO' SO I ANTICIPATED APPLYING PWR AS SOON AS HE BROKE GND. WHEN THIS ACFT LIFTED OFF I STARTED MY PWR APPLICATION. AFTER I HAD ROLLED APPROX 150 FT; JUST PAST THE NEXT AVAILABLE TURNOFF; AND WITH ABOUT 1/2-2/3 OF MY PWR APPLIED; I HEARD AN ACFT CALL ON CTAF 'SHORT FINAL.' AS IT WAS TOO LATE TO TURN OFF; AND NOT SURE HOW 'SHORT' ON FINAL THIS ACFT WAS; I RAPIDLY PUSHED IN THE REMAINING PWR -- HOPING TO GIVE THIS ACFT ROOM TO LAND BEHIND ME. AT ABOUT 40-50 KTS ON MY AIRSPD INDICATOR; I HEARD 'CESSNA ON THE RWY; I'M AT YOUR 6 O'CLOCK AND RAPIDLY OVERTAKING YOU.' I KNEW NOW THAT THE OTHER ACFT SAW ME; BUT I STILL DID NOT KNOW HOW CLOSE HE REALLY WAS OR WHAT HIS INTENTIONS WERE. AS I REACHED LIFT-OFF SPD THE OTHER ACFT PASSED DIRECTLY OVER ME AT ABOUT 75 FT TO 100 FT ABOVE THE RWY. HE WAS MAINTAINING THIS LOW ALT AND THE EXACT CTRLINE OF THE RWY. I AM VERY CONFIDENT OF MY ESTIMATION OF HIS ALT/SEPARATION ABOVE ME AS I SPENT MANY YRS REFUELING BEHIND AND BELOW AIR FORCE TANKERS. HAVING OVERTAKEN ME FROM BEHIND THIS OTHER ACFT APPEARED TO STAGNATE ABOUT 150-200 FT AHEAD OF ME AND STILL ONLY ABOUT 100 FT ABOVE ME. I NOW BEGAN TO SLOWLY OVERTAKE THE ACFT OVERHEAD AS MY ACFT CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE AFTER LIFT-OFF. I DECIDED TO LEAVE MY GEAR DOWN FOR THE TIME BEING AS I DID NOT WANT TO 'UNDERFLY' THE OTHER ACFT AND THEREBY LOSE SIGHT OF HIM. IT WAS OBVIOUS THEN; AS I WAS LOOKING DIRECTLY UP AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS ACFT (NO OFFSET BY HIM FROM THE RWY CTRLINE); THAT HE HAD LONG SINCE LOST SIGHT OF ME AS I WENT UNDER HIS NOSE. AS I SLOWLY OVERTOOK HIM; AND AS HE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE CLBING AT ALL; I TURNED L OFF RWY HEADING (AT ABOUT 10-15 FT AGL) FAR ENOUGH TO GAIN SOME LATERAL SEPARATION BEFORE I PASSED ABEAM AND HE DISAPPEARED FROM MY VIEW ABOVE MY R WING. ONLY WHEN I WAS ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT I WAS AHEAD AND WENT OFF TO THE L DID I RAISE THE NOSE AND FINALLY RETRACT MY LNDG GEAR. IN REFLECTION; I FEEL I DILIGENTLY FOLLOWED PROPER PROCS; YET WE STILL WOUND UP IN A VERY DANGEROUS SIT. I WONDERED WHY I DID NOT HEAR A 'TURNING BASE' OR 'TURNING FINAL' CALL FROM THE OTHER ACFT. IN REFLECTION; IT MAY BE THAT WE 'STEPPED' ON EACH OTHER WHEN I MADE MY 'TAKING RWY 22' CALL ON CTAF. IF HE WAS JUST TURNING BASE; AND ANNOUNCED THIS ACTION AT THE SAME TIME; NEITHER OF US WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HEAR THE OTHER. AT THIS TIME; HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN JUST BEHIND THE LEADING EDGE OF MY L WING (WHERE HE WOULD HAVE REMAINED AS I MADE A R TURN BACK TO TXWY AND ANOTHER R TURN ONTO THE RWY). MY MODERATE DELAY ON THE RWY; WAITING FOR THE TOUCH AND GO ACFT TO LIFT-OFF; MIGHT HAVE ALLOWED TIME FOR A SHORT BASE LEG AND TURN TO FINAL. WHY; HOWEVER; DID THE OTHER ACFT NOT SAY ANYTHING UNTIL 'SHORT' FINAL? WHY DIDN'T HE START A GAR AS SOON AS HE SAW ME; AND ABOVE ALL ELSE; WHY DIDN'T HE OFFSET FROM THE RWY SO HE COULD AT LEAST KEEP ME IN SIGHT?

AFTER I HAD PERFORMED A FULL STOP LNDG FOLLOWED BY A TKOF AND A TOUCH-AND-GO LNDG; THE CTL TWR CLRED ME TO LAND JUST AS I WAS ENTERING THE DOWNWIND LEG FROM THE XWIND LEG OF THE PATTERN. OTHER TFC WAS CLOSE ON THE APCH TO RWY 24 AND THE CLRNC WAS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AMENDED TO EXTEND DOWNWIND FOR 2 OTHER ACFT; A SINGLE AND A TWIN; THAT WERE NOT YET VISIBLE TO ME. BY THE TIME I REACHED A POINT ON DOWNWIND PARALLEL TO THE APCH END OF THE RWY; THE SINGLE HAD LANDED AND THE TWIN WAS ON SHORT FINAL. THE TWR CALLED MY BASE CLOSER TO THE END OF THE RWY THAN I WAS EXPECTING. I WAS STILL AT PATTERN ALT. I LOWERED THE FLAPS WHILE MAKING THE TURN TO BASE AND WAS STILL HIGH WHEN I TURNED TO FINAL. I CONCENTRATED ON GETTING THE AIRPLANE SLOWED DOWN AND ON THE DSCNT TO THE RWY. I FAILED TO PUT THE LNDG GEAR DOWN. THIS AIRPLANE DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF DRAG AT PATTERN SPDS WITH THE GEAR DOWN SINCE THE GEAR DOORS ARE CLOSED. I DID NOT NOTICE ANY ABNORMAL DIFFICULTY IN SLOWING THE AIRPLANE TO LNDG SPD. I FAILED TO LOOK AT THE GEAR OR THE GEAR DOWN LIGHTS AND BY THE TIME THE PROP HIT THE RWY AND I RECOGNIZED WHAT HAD HAPPENED; IT WAS TOO LATE TO AVOID THE GEAR UP LNDG. THE GEAR WARNING HORN HAD BEEN TESTED AT A RECENT ANNUAL INSPECTION AS WELL AS ON MY PREFLT TEST PRECEDING THE FIRST TKOF FOR THIS FLT. IT DID NOT SOUND WHEN I CUT THE THROTTLE ON FINAL WHILE STILL HIGH ENOUGH TO RESPOND; OR; IF I DID; I DID NOT HEAR IT THROUGH MY HEADSET. IT IS LOUD ENOUGH THAT I NORMALLY HEAR IT WITH THE HEADSET ON WHEN I PUSH THE TEST SWITCH BUT THE ENG IS NOT NORMALLY RUNNING WHEN THIS PREFLT TEST IS PERFORMED. AFTER REMOVING THE AIRPLANE FROM THE RWY; THE MECH ASKED ME WHY I HADN'T LOWERED THE GEAR WHEN THE HORN SOUNDED. I SAID THE HORN DID NOT SOUND FOR EITHER THE GEAR OR THE STALL. HE CHKED IT AND FOUND THAT GEAR WARNING WORKED NORMALLY FROM THE TEST SWITCH BUT WOULD GIVE ONLY A SINGLE; SHORT; LOW VOLUME BEEP WHEN THE THROTTLE SWITCH CLOSED AND WOULD NOT SOUND CONTINUOUSLY WHEN ACTUATED BY THE THROTTLE SWITCH. THE RESULT WAS A GEAR UP LNDG THAT CLOSED THE ARPT FOR ABOUT 40 MINS; CAUSED EXPENSIVE DAMAGE TO MY AIRPLANE; TOOK IT OTS AT A TIME WHEN I NEEDED IT; AND COULD HAVE HAD MORE SEVERE EFFECTS. ALTHOUGH THE BASIC CAUSE WAS MY FAILURE TO LOWER THE GEAR; THE PROB COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF ONE OR BOTH OF 2 THINGS HAPPENED. IF THE GEAR HORN WORKED; IF IT HAD SOUNDED THROUGH THE HEADSET; I WOULD NOT HAVE MISSED IT. IF THE TWR HAD OBSERVED THE FINAL APCH AND INDICATED THE GEAR PROB; I WOULD NOT HAVE LANDED WITH THE GEAR UP. I BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED TO PLTS OF RETRACTABLE GEAR ACFT THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY AND PROBABLY NOT DESIRABLE TO RETRACT THE GEAR WHILE DOING CLOSED PATTERN WORK. ALSO; LAST MIN CHANGES IN INSTRUCTIONS WHEN IN THE PATTERN AND TFC THAT IS CLOSELY SPACED CAN CAUSE ATTN TO BE DIVERTED DURING CRITICAL PHASES OF FLT AND CONTRIBUTE TO THIS TYPE OF PROB.",,,,"PVT PLT OF A CESSNA 210 FORGOT TO LOWER THE LDNG GEAR AND LANDED GEAR UP.

HE HAD LEARNED THE BEST SOLUTION WAS TO SWITCH TANKS AND THAT HE REMEMBERED WHEN HE WAS DISCUSSING THE SIT WITH THE MECH DURING A POSTFLT INSPECTION. THE PROB OCCURS BECAUSE THE FUEL SYS IN THE T210 HAS VERY SMALL DIAMETER FUEL FEED LINES WHERE THEY ENTER THE ENG. THIS IS FUEL INJECTED AND WHEN ALL THE FUEL IS NOT USED IT COLLECTS IN A FEED TANK JUST PRIOR TO ENTRY INTO THE ENG. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL DIAMETER OF THE LINES THE VAPOR DOES NOT RETURN TO THE FUEL VENT. AS IT COLLECTS IT CREATES THE VAPOR LOCK. SWITCHING TO THE SECOND TANK GIVES TIME FOR THE VAPOR TO BLEED OUT WHEN THE TANK IS NOT IN USE. ONE T210 OWNER WITH WHOM RPTR SPOKE SAYS THAT HE HAS THE PROB ABOUT 30 MINS INTO EACH FLT. THE FUEL SYS SITS ON TOP OF THE ENG AND IT GETS VERY HOT CREATING THE VAPOR LOCK PROB.

MY AIRPLANE REMAINED STANDING ON ITS NOSE AND MAIN LNDG GEAR. FUEL WAS ESCAPING FROM THE FUEL VENT ON TOP OF THE WING BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME NOSE DOWN POS OF THE AIRPLANE AS IT SAT. I EXITED THE AIRPLANE; THEN RE-ENTERED TO TURN OFF THE MASTER SWITCH; THE FUEL AND THE IGNITION. FUEL CONTINUED TO ESCAPE FROM THE VENT UNTIL I OBTAINED A LADDER AND PLUGGED THE VENT WITH SOME PUTTY. A ROPE WAS THROWN OVER THE TOP OF THE FUSELAGE IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THE VERT STABILIZER. WITH THE HELP OF ABOUT 6 PEOPLE; THE TAIL WAS PULLED DOWN; THEN LOWERED GENTLY TO THE GND. I THEN TOWED THE ACFT TO MY HANGAR WHERE IT WAS CHKED FOR FUEL LEAKS; AND PRELIMINARILY CHKED FOR DAMAGE. A PRELIMINARY CHK OF DAMAGE SHOWED DAMAGE TO THE PROP; SPINNER; AND LOWER COWLING. BECAUSE THIS DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; THOUGH PRELIMINARY; SUGGESTS THAT THE AIRPLANE DID NOT SUSTAIN 'SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE' WITHIN THE MEANING OF 49 CFR PART 830.2; AND SINCE THERE WERE NO INJURIES; I DETERMINED THAT AN 'INCIDENT' HAD OCCURRED WITHIN THE MEANING OF THAT SAME SECTION.

I WAS SCHEDULED FOR A FLT IN C210; FOR A RECONNAISSANCE IN THE AREA OF THE ROHNERVILLE ARPT. I WAS TO TAKE 2 ENGINEERS TO ROHNERVILLE TO MEET A THIRD INDIVIDUAL WHO WOULD THEN GO WITH US TO PHOTOGRAPH THE CONFLUENCE OF THE EEL AND VAN DUZEN RIVERS. WHILE IN THE OFFICE I RAN A WT AND BAL FOR THE FLT TO INSURE THAT I WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE MORE RESTRICTIVE REQUIREMENTS OF PART 135; ALTHOUGH I KNEW THE OBJECTIVE OF THE FLT WAS RECONNAISSANCE. I BROUGHT THE ACFT TO THE TERMINAL BUILDING; MET MY PAX AND BRIEFED THE FLT. THEIR OBJECTIVE WAS TO DO PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE ROHNERVILLE AREA AS WELL AS EXAMINE BRIDGES IN THE VICINITY OF UKIAH AND CLOVERDALE. WE DISCUSSED WHETHER TO DO THIS ON THE WAY UP OR ON THE RETURN. IT WAS DECIDED TO DO THIS ON THE RETURN IN ORDER TO MEET THE SCHEDULE AT ROHNERVILLE. ON ARR IN THE FOT AREA WE DID A TURN AROUND THE BRIDGE IN QUESTION TO GET AN INITIAL LAYOUT OF THE SITE. WE PICKED UP THE THIRD TECHNICIAN AND CONDUCTED THE RECONNAISSANCE OUT OF ROHNERVILLE. WE HAD BEEN OPERATING BTWN 2000 FT AND 1000 FT ALONG THE RIVER AT LOW AIRSPDS WITH 10 DEGS OF FLAPS SET. AT APPROX 1200 FT; WE COMPLETED THE LAST SET OF PHOTOS OF A SITE JUST TO THE S OF THE FOT ARPT AT PATTERN ALT; APPROX 1200 FT. WE MADE A R TURN ONTO A 45 DEG TO DOWNWIND FOR RWY 29 AT APPROX 20 INCHES MANIFOLD PRESSURE AND 100 KTS. I CALLED MY POS AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER CALLED TURNING DOWNWIND. I MADE THE TURN AND I RECALL CHKING FLAPS AT 10 DEGS AND NOTING THEY WERE ALREADY DOWN. I BEGAN REVIEWING THE LNDG CHKLIST. I LOOKED DOWN TO CHK MY FUEL AND NOTED THAT THE L TANK WAS LOWER THAN THE R; SO I SWITCHED TO THE R TANK TO LAND WITH THE FULLEST SELECTED. I LOOKED OVER TO CHK MY POS RELATIVE TO THE RWY; BUT DID NOT MAKE MY NORMAL CHK OF GEAR DOWN ABEAM THE LNDG POINT. I DO NOT KNOW WHY I DID NOT COMPLETE THIS ITEM. I RETARDED PWR THEN PUSHED THE MIXTURE AND PROP CTL FORWARD. I MADE A NORMAL BASE TURN; AIRSPD WAS ABOUT 90 KTS AND SEEMED NORMAL FOR THE PATTERN. I REMEMBER RECHKING THE GAS; PROP AND MIXTURE CTLS; BUT NOT THE GEAR. WE DSNDED ON FINAL; AND I RECALL THE GLIDE PATH BEING NORMAL TO SLIGHTLY HIGH; SO I BROUGHT THE THROTTLE TO IDLE. I FLARED AFTER PASSING THE THRESHOLD OF THE RWY AND BEGAN RAISING THE NOSE. I BELIEVE THE FIRST SOUND I HEARD WAS THE PROP STRIKING THE RWY FOLLOWED BY SCRAPING OF THE REAR FUSELAGE. THE ACFT SETTLED ONTO THE RWY JUST PRIOR TO THE 1000 FT MARKER AND SLID ABOUT 700 FT BEFORE COMING TO REST. I ASCERTAINED THAT THE PAX SEEMED TO BE UNINJURED AND DIRECTED THE EVAC OF THE ACFT. AT NO POINT DID THE GEAR WARNING SOUND DURING THE PATTERN; AND; UPON REFLECTION; I DO NOT REMEMBER IT SOUNDING WHILE WE WERE ON THE RECONNAISSANCE FLT; ALTHOUGH THE PWR SETTINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN LOW ENOUGH THAT IT SHOULD HAVE AT SOME POINT. I HAD CHKED IT PRIOR TO THE FIRST FLT OF THE DAY AND DETERMINED THAT IT WAS WORKING. THE ACFT REMAINED ON THE RWY UNTIL MECHS FROM EUREKA WERE ABLE TO JACK THE ACFT; AND THE LNDG GEAR WAS LOWERED NORMALLY. THEY SAID THAT THE DAMAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE ACFT WAS NOT SEVERE; BUT THE PROP WAS NOT REPAIRABLE. AFTER THE FLT I CHKED THE GEAR WARNING HORN AND IT WAS NOT WORKING. THAT AFTERNOON I WAS CONTACTED AT THE ROHNERVILLE ARPT BY MR Y OF THE FAA. HE INTERVIEWED ME REGARDING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE INCIDENT AND THEN REVIEWED THE ACFT DOCUMENTATION; AS WELL AS THE PAPERWORK FOR THE FLT. I SHOWED HIM THE WT AND BAL CALCULATIONS FOR THE FLT; AND HE NOTED THAT THEY HAD BEEN PREPARED INCORRECTLY. I HAD RUN THE WT AND BAL PROGRAM ON FLIGHTSOFT FLT PLANNING SOFTWARE AND HAD INADVERTENTLY PRINTED THE INFO FOR THE WRONG ACFT; ALTHOUGH THE PAX WTS WERE CORRECT. I HAD CALCULATED A SIMILAR LOAD MANY TIMES BEFORE AND KNEW IT TO BE WITHIN LIMITS; SO NEGLECTED TO CHK THE PRINTOUT CLOSELY. I HAVE FLOWN A LARGE NUMBER OF THESE RECONNAISSANCE MISSIONS; HOWEVER MAINLY IN THE C206 WITH FIXED GEAR. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HABIT PATTERNS FROM THAT SORT OF MISSION MAY HAVE CARRIED OVER TO THIS FLT. I HAVE OVER 2100 HRS IN THE C206; AND I WOULD ESTIMATE AT LEAST 75% HAVE BEEN RECONNAISSANCE. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR STATES HE IS WITH AN AIR TAXI OP; PART 135. RPTR CONTACTED THE LCL FSDO AND THERE WAS NO PROB EXCEPT THE CHK RIDE WITH THE FAA REPRESENTATIVE. SINCE HE IS VERY PRECISE IN HIS FLYING HE IS STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED.

I CONFIRMED IT; AND HE QUICKLY ASKED ME IF I HAD SEEN THE TFC. I SAID 'NEGATIVE.' HE SAID THAT I JUST CUT SOMEONE OFF. AT THIS POINT I GOT NERVOUS AND FORGOT THE XPONDER CODE AND ASKED HIM TO REPEAT IT FOR ME WHICH HE DID. I CONTINUED ON FOR MAYBE A MIN OR SO AND HE CALLED ME; AND SAID I WAS TO CALL THE TWR BY PHONE WHEN I LANDED IN COLUMBIA. I COPIED THE NUMBER DOWN AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER HE TOLD ME TO SET XPONDER TO 1200 VFR.

I MUST HAVE SOMEHOW MISINTERPED THE CONVERSATIONS I HAD WITH MY INSTRUCTOR AND ASSUMED SINCE I HAD OVER 80 HRS IN THAT AIRPLANE I WAS SIGNED OFF TO DO MY XCOUNTRY TRAINING. HOWEVER; THAT WAS MY FIRST MISTAKE. THE SECOND MISTAKE WAS; I SHOULD HAVE MADE A R DOWNWIND DEP INSTEAD OF THE L WHICH WOULD HAVE HELPED ME AVOID THE APCHING TFC LNDG ON RWY 11 AT FYI. MY THIRD MISTAKE WAS THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE AWARE OF THE AREA AND THE CLASS C AIRSPACE. THE FACT THAT FYI RWYS 11/29 AND SIERRA SKY PARK RWYS 12/30 ARE ONLY 8.5 MI APART AND SINCE I'VE ALWAYS TAKEN OFF TO THE N; I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND SHOULD HAVE CHKED IN WITH DEP SOONER.

I HAD FILED FOR 11000 FT UPON ARR AN HR EARLIER BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE DURING THE TRIP TO LUK ALONG THE SAME RTE. THE BRIEFER ALSO PROVIDED ME WITH A NUMBER OF PIREPS FOR ICING CONDITIONS IN THE LUK AREA. ALL WERE FOR ALTS ABOVE 5000 FT. OUR PLAN WAS TO ASK FOR 4000 FT DURING THE CLB; CONSIDERING THE PIREPS. SEEING THAT THE CLOUDS WERE HIGHER; WE ASKED FOR; AND WERE CLRED TO; 5000 FT. THIS ALT KEPT US CLR OF ANY CLOUDS WITHIN SIGHT. ABOUT 20-30 MINS INTO THE FLT I SAW A LONE; SMALL; WEIRD LOOKING CLOUD THAT EXTENDED BELOW THE LAYER AT 6000 FT DOWN TO ABOUT 4000 FT. OUTSIDE AIR TEMP WAS AROUND -3 DEGS C. IMMEDIATELY UPON ENTERING THE CLOUD THE WINDSHIELD WAS PELTED WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE RAIN; FREEZING RAIN; AND SNOW MIX. I IMMEDIATELY REQUESTED A DSCNT TO 4000 FT AND WAS SO CLRED. THIS 'CLOUD;' UPON REFLECTION; WAS PROBABLY VIRGA. I BEGAN THE DSCNT AND NOTICED NO CHANGE IN THE ALTIMETER READING. THE AI SHOWED ABOUT A 4 BAR DSCNT ANGLE. THE PAX; ALSO AN INST RATED PLT; RPTED THE CONDITION TO THE CTLR AND OPENED THE ALTERNATE STATIC SOURCE. AFTER WHAT WAS PROBABLY NO MORE THAN 1 1/2 MINS (ALTHOUGH IT FELT LONGER) WE WERE IN THE CLR. WITHIN ANOTHER MIN; THE STATIC SOURCE WAS CLR AND ALL INSTS WERE FUNCTIONING NORMALLY. I BELIEVE THE CHOICE TO DEPART WAS CORRECT; SAFE; AND WITHIN THE SPIRIT OF FAR 91.527; OPERATING IN ICING CONDITIONS. THE PROB WAS NOT RECOGNIZING THE TRUE NATURE OF THE CLOUD. ALSO; GIVEN THAT THE CLOUD WAS SMALL ENOUGH TO FLY AROUND AND REMAIN BASICALLY ON COURSE; THE RIGHT DECISION WOULD HAVE BEEN TO FLY AROUND IT AND NOT THROUGH IT.

I TOLD HIM IF HE FELT HE WAS GOING TO BE LONG AND HAVE PROBS STOPPING TO GO AROUND. HE CONTINUED AND APPEARED TO HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB OF RECOVERING. HE COMMENCED HIS FLARE AND SUDDENLY SAID 'OH XXXX!' AS THE PROP STRUCK AND THE SKID STARTED. IT APPEARS THAT THE SIMULATED EMER WAS THE STARTING POINT OF THE PROB. ADDITIONAL FACTORS WERE THE R-HAND PATTERN WHICH WE HAD DISCUSSED DURING THE GND PORTION. A THIRD (AFTER THE FACT) PROB WAS THAT HE HAD NEVER DONE AN EMER LNDG ALL THE WAY TO THE RWY. HIS PREVIOUS INSTRUCTORS HAD ALWAYS LET HIM GO AROUND; SO PERHAPS HE NEVER PUT THE GEAR DOWN UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. THERE WAS A FLT INSTRUCTOR PRESENT ON THE FIELD AND AFTER ALL PARTIES READING NTSB PART 830; WE ALL AGREED THAT THIS WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT BY DEFINITION; BUT SIMPLY AN EVENT. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 386228: THE PRIMARY FACTOR WAS INADEQUATE COM/RAPPORT BTWN PLT AND INSTRUCTOR/EXAMINER.

AFTER CONTACTING THE TWR; I PROCEEDED TO PUT THE GEAR SWITCH DOWN. AT THE TIME I WAS ABOUT 4 MI FROM THE RWY WHEN I DID MY FIRST GUMPS CHK. THAT WAS WHEN I FIRST NOTICED THAT I DID NOT HAVE A GREEN LIGHT INDICATING THAT MY GEAR WAS DOWN AND LOCKED. I WENT AHEAD AND RECYCLED THE GEAR SWITCH AND STILL NO GREEN LIGHT. I PROCEEDED AT THAT TIME TO INITIATE A GAR AND NOTIFIED THE TWR OF THAT AND ALSO THAT I DID NOT HAVE A GREEN LIGHT IN THE COCKPIT. I ASKED THE TWR IF I COULD GO OUT E OF THE ARPT TO TROUBLESHOOT THE PROB. THEY SAID THAT WAS NO PROB AND TO KEEP THEM ADVISED IF I NEEDED ANYTHING. I PROCEEDED TO GET OUT THE CHKLIST AS WELL AS THE POH TO TROUBLESHOOT. I TRIED EVERYTHING THAT WAS WRITTEN AND STILL NO GREEN LIGHT. WHEN I PUT THE GEAR UP IT WOULD GO UP NORMALLY AND THE AMBER GEAR UP LIGHT WOULD ILLUMINATE AS NORMAL. HOWEVER WHEN I PUT THE GEAR SWITCH DOWN THE GEAR SOUNDED LIKE IT CAME DOWN NORMALLY BUT I NEVER GOT A GREEN LIGHT; THE HYD PUMP CONTINUED TO RUN UNTIL THE HYD PUMP CIRCUIT BREAKER POPPED. I KEPT THE TWR INFORMED OF MY SIT AND WHAT I WAS DOING TO TROUBLESHOOT THE PROB. THE TWR GOT 2 MECHS (WHO DO ALL THE MAINT ON THIS PARTICULAR PLANE) UP INTO THE TWR TO HELP. I PROCEEDED TO DO SEVERAL PASSES BY THE TWR SO THEY COULD OBSERVE MY GEAR. THEY INFORMED ME AFTER EACH PASS THAT ALL 3 WHEELS 'APPEARED' TO BE DOWN AND LOCKED; HOWEVER; THE FRONT GEAR CLAMSHELL DOORS REMAINED OPEN (THESE ARE SUPPOSED TO CLOSE UPON PROPER GEAR EXTENSION). MY CONCERN AT THAT TIME WAS THAT THE NOSE GEAR WAS NOT DOWN AND LOCKED BECAUSE I COULD VISUALLY CHK FOR THE L AND R MAINS FROM THE COCKPIT AND THEY 'APPEARED' TO BE DOWN AND LOCKED. AFTER APPROX 1 HR AND 15 MINS OF TROUBLESHOOTING AND 4 OR 5 TWR PASSES I FELT THAT I HAD RECEIVED ALL THE ADVICE I COULD GET UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND STILL NO GREEN LIGHT. THE MECHS SEEMED TO THINK THAT IT MAY JUST BE A BROKEN SWITCH OR WIRE AND I TENDED TO BELIEVE THE SAME THING GIVEN THEIR OBSERVATIONS AS WELL AS MY OWN. ON TOP OF THAT; I TRIED EVERY CONCEIVABLE OPTION TO GET THE GEAR DOWN AND GET A GREEN LIGHT; I RECYCLED THE GEAR; CHKED THE HYD FLUID IN THE RESERVOIR; MANUALLY PUMPED THE GEAR DOWN; VERIFIED THE GREEN LIGHT WAS NOT BURNED OUT; ETC. THIS WHOLE TIME I WORKED WITH THE TWR VERY CLOSELY AND WAS ABLE TO STAY OUT OF THE WAY OF OTHER TFC THEY WERE WORKING. FORTUNATELY THEY WERE NOT BUSY WORKING MANY FLTS AT ALL. AFTER REVIEWING THE CHKLIST FOR 'LNDG WITHOUT PROPER INDICATION OF THE GEAR BEING DOWN;' I INFORMED THE TWR THAT WHEN THEY GET A CHANCE I WOULD LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND ATTEMPT A LNDG. THEY ASKED ME IF THEY COULD GET SOME PLANES IN TO LAND BEFORE ME IN CASE I HAD TO CLOSE DOWN THE RWY. I SAID CERTAINLY BECAUSE I WAS IN NO HURRY (AT THIS POINT I STILL HAD ABOUT 4 HRS OF FUEL LEFT). WHEN THEY HAD A BREAK IN THE INCOMING TFC I ASKED FOR AND RECEIVED CLRNC FOR A LOW PASS TO CHK OUT THE WINDS. ON APCH I HAD NOTICED THAT THE CRASH TRUCKS AND RESCUE TEAM WAS WAITING ON ALL THE TXWYS FOR ME. I DID MY PASS AND CAME BACK AROUND TO LAND. FORTUNATELY THE WINDS WERE 170 DEGS AT 18 KTS AND I WAS LNDG RWY 17; SO I FELT VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. I MADE A NORMAL FULL FLAP APCH AND SOFT FIELD LNDG. WHEN MY MAIN WHEELS WERE ON THE RWY I PULLED THE MIXTURE OUT AND KEPT THE NOSE OFF AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AND AS I WAS SLOWING DOWN I LOWERED IT VERY SLOWLY. MY GND SPD ON TOUCHDOWN COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE THAN 30 KTS OR SO. I LANDED STRAIGHT AND ON THE CTRLINE SO I IMMEDIATELY REMOVED MY FEET FROM THE RUDDER PEDALS SO I WOULD NOT CAUSE A PROB BY STEERING OR BRAKING. AS THE ACFT SLOWED DOWN ON THE RWY I PROCEEDED TO COMPLETE THE CHKLIST ITEMS BY SHUTTING OFF THE FUEL; MAGNETOS AND MASTER SWITCH. AFTER THE AIRPLANE CAME TO A STOP I EXITED AND EVERYTHING APPEARED TO BE NORMAL; ALL THE GEARS STAYED DOWN. THE CRASH AND RESCUE TEAM RESPONDED HOWEVER FORTUNATELY THEY WERE NOT NEEDED. AFTER THE PLANE WAS TOWED TO MAINT AND PUT UP ON JACKS IT WAS FOUND THAT THE L MAIN WASNEVER LOCKED DOWN. THE L MAIN DOWN LOCK NEVER MOVED INTO PLACE. THEREFORE; THE SWITCH WAS NEVER TRIPPED; THE GREEN LIGHT NEVER CAME ON AND THE PUMP CONTINUED TO RUN. THE NOSE GEAR DOORS STAYED OPEN BECAUSE THEY WAIT FOR THE GREEN LIGHT BEFORE THEY CLOSE.

TAXI CLRNC GIVEN TO RWY 9L VIA GOLF; ECHO; KILO. TURNING FROM ECHO TO KILO I NOTED THE DIRECTION ARROW AND FOLLOWED THE YELLOW TAXI LINE TO COMPLETE THE TURN. IN THE RAIN I DID NOT NOTICE OTHER LINES. WHEN LINING UP WITH TXWY KILO I NOTED A LARGE 2 ENG BOEING TAXI TOWARD ME AND A DASH 8 HOLDING TO MY L. I DETERMINED THAT THE BOEING WOULD BE TURNED INTO THE RAMP BEFORE I REACHED THE AREA AND THE DASH 8 WAS WAITING TO BACK TAXI BEHIND ME. I WAS CONSIDERING QUERYING THE STATUS WITH GND CTL BUT BEFORE I COULD I NOTED THAT THE BOEING WAS ACCELERATING AND NOT TURNING. I TOOK EVASIVE ACTION BY MOVING TO THE R. THE BOEING ROTATED IN FRONT OF MY POSITION AND WAS AIRBORNE ABEAM OF ME. IT APPEARED THAT THE BOEING TOOK EVASIVE ACTION BY RAISING ITS L WING. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: I HAD DECLINED A SHORTER TAXI TO RWY 17 AS IT WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME A QUARTERING TAILWIND. THERE WAS WATER ON THE GND AND POOR LIGHTING. THIS AFFECTED THE VISIBILITY OF PAINTED LINES ON CONCRETE. A TRANSVERSE OR OBLIQUE LINE IS NOT AS EASILY SEEN. THIS AFFECTED MY VIEW OF THE TXWYS AND HAD ME FOLLOWING THE LINE ON TO KILO 2. WHEN TAKING OFF A SHORT WHILE LATER I COULD SEE THAT THE YELLOW LINE ALONG KILO 2 WAS DARKER; POSSIBLY HAVING BEEN REPAINTED. THE HOLD SHORT LINE WAS NOT SEEN DUE TO THE RAIN. PREOCCUPATION WITH THE BOEING AND DASH 8 KEPT ME FROM OBSERVING THE RWY ENVIRONMENT. THE GND CTLR WAS NOT MONITORING MY PROGRESS AND ALSO NOT NOTICED MY INTRUSION ON TO THE RWY. HUMAN PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS. POOR LIGHTING WITH RAIN AND GND WATER AFFECTED VISIBILITY OF THE TXWY LINES AND PERSPECTIVE OF THE RWY TXWY ENVIRONMENT. THE TURN FROM ECHO TO KILO 2 IS ONLY 30 DEGS LESS THAN KILO AND GIVES THE IMPRESSION OF A R ANGLE TURN. PROGRESSIVE TAXI INSTRUCTIONS WOULD HAVE HELPED THE SIT. A DIFFERENT LINE DENOTING TRANSITIONS FROM TXWY TO RWY WAY ALSO ASSIST PLTS WHEN MAKING THIS TRANSITION; SUCH AS AN ALTERNATING YELLOW AND WHITE LINE. WITH REFLECTIVE PAINT; MAY ALSO BE MORE EASILY NOTED AT NIGHT.

HE SPOKE TO THE TWR SUPVR WHO WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF VISIBILITY OF THE TXWY MARKING AND DID INDICATE THAT IS A CONFUSING AREA WHEN RAIN AND DIM LIGHTING EXISTS. RPTR DID NOT SEE ANY HOLD LINES AND COULD NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE YELLOW LINES AND ANY OTHER MARKINGS. THE RAIN OBSCURED THEM. HE WAS ACTUALLY ON THE RWY WITH THE BOEING ACFT TAKING OFF OVER HIM. HE HAD MOVED TO THE SIDE OF THE RWY WHEN HE REALIZED THE SIT. LCL CTLR CAME ON FREQ IMMEDIATELY AND RPTR STATED HE REALIZED WHERE HE WAS AND WAS IN THE PROCESS OF TAXIING OFF THE RWY.

I THEN STARTED SMELLING A TRACE OF FUEL IN THE ACFT AND RPTED IT TO PEORIA DEP AND STARTED TO SHUT OFF AS MANY ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS AS I COULD; TO LESSEN THE CHANCE OF A FIRE. THE FUEL SMELL IN THE COCKPIT CAME FROM VAPORS ENTERING A GAP IN THE WINDOW NEAR THE REAR OF THE ACFT. PEORIA DEP ADVISED US TO CANCEL IFR WITH THEM ON THE GND AT BLOOMINGTON. WE PARKED AND EVACED THE ACFT. WE DISCOVERED THAT FUEL CAP CAME LOOSE JUST ENOUGH TO LET THE FUEL ESCAPE; EVEN THOUGH IT WAS STILL IN PLACE.

INACTIVE RWYS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OLDER PART OF THE FIELD ON ITS E SIDE WERE RWY 3/21 AND RWY 18/36. NUMEROUS TXWYS CROSS THESE RWYS TO SERVE THE E AND S RAMPS. THE E RAMP IN PARTICULAR IS ONLY A FEW FT REMOVED FROM AND PARALLEL TO RWY 18/36 ALONG ITS LENGTH. I LISTENED TO ATIS AND OBTAINED IFR CLRNC AFTER ENG STARTUP WHILE ON THE FBO'S RAMP ON THE SE CORNER OF THE FIELD. I THEN CONTACTED GND CTL PRIOR TO TAXI AND WAS TOLD TO RUN UP ON THE 'E END OF THE RAMP' OR 'E RAMP' AND CALL WHEN 'READY TO REPOSITION AFTER RUNUP.' I EXPECTED TO BE TOLD TO TAXI TO RWY 27; THEN RUN UP; BUT I CAREFULLY MOVED OUT OF THE WAY OF AN ARRIVING ACFT TAXIING AROUND ME AND AWAY FROM THE FBO'S FRONT DOOR TO DO MY RUNUP. HOW IT WAS DISCOVERED: UNFORTUNATELY; I HAD INADVERTENTLY MOVED ONTO THE S END OF RWY 18/36 AT THE INTXN OF AN E/W TXWY; THE RWY END; AND THE OVERRUN. I PAUSED TO CHK MAGNETOS; AND CALLED THE TWR TO 'REPOSITION.' TWR ASKED IF THAT WAS MY PLANE ON A RWY. I REPLIED; 'SORRY; I'LL MOVE IMMEDIATELY;' AND THEN ASKED FOR AND RECEIVED PROGRESSIVE TAXI INSTRUCTIONS TO RWY 27L AND (AFTER TKOF CLRNC) DEPARTED -- THANKING TWR FOR THEIR HELP AND PATIENCE. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: THE COMPLICATION OF THIS PARTICULAR FLT AND ALL OF ITS DETAILS WAS PERHAPS A FACTOR; BUT I DIDN'T FEEL PARTICULARLY STRESSED; JUST BUSY. THE FACT THAT AN AIRPLANE HAD JUST TAXIED FROM THE LOCATION I CHOSE FOR MY RUNUP (THE INTERSECTING TXWY WAS THE MAIN E/W TXWY ON THE S SIDE OF THE FIELD; IE; THE 'E END OF THE RAMP' TO ME). I DIDN'T NOTICE LIGHTS ALONG RWY 18/36. IF I HAD SEEN WHITE LIGHTS; I WOULD NOT HAVE ENTERED. PERHAPS SINCE IT WAS NOT AN ACTIVE RWY THAT NIGHT; THE LIGHTS WEREN'T ON; OR THE LIGHTS DIDN'T EXTEND TO THE END OF THE RWY WHERE I WAS. MY UNFAMILIARITY WITH THE FIELD. THE RAIN/WIND/NIGHT DIDN'T HELP. I WANTED TO BE A GOOD NEIGHBOR AND MOVE AWAY FROM A BUSY RAMP AND FBO BEFORE RUNNING UP; AND DIDN'T EXPECT A RWY THAT CLOSE BY -- IN FACT; I PROBABLY THOUGHT IT WAS A N/S TXWY JUST OFF THE RAMP AT THE TIME. I WAS NOSED ACROSS THE RWY AT ITS END; AT THE OVERRUN REGION; SO I DIDN'T NOTICE ANY MARKINGS; ETC IN FRONT OF ME AS I POINTED W (INTO THE WIND) DOWN THE E/W TXWY; STOPPED; AND CALLED THE TWR. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: THERE WAS A RUNUP AREA NEAR THE DEP END OF RWY 27L. PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLRED TO TAXI THERE BEFORE RUNUP. I COULD HAVE MENTIONED TO THE GND CTLR THAT I WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH THE ARPT AND ASKED FOR HELP COMPLYING WITH HIS RUNUP INSTRUCTIONS; BUT I DIDN'T FEEL THERE WOULD BE A PROB DOING SO. A WORD OF WARNING BY THE GND CTLR (EG; 'DO NOT CROSS RWY 18/36 IN FRONT OF YOU) WOULD HAVE HELPED A LOT AT THE TIME. SINCE THIS OLDER RWY CONFIGN BORDERS THE E RAMP AND SEPARATES IT FROM THE NEWER MAIN RWYS; EVERY AIRPLANE GOING THERE NEEDS TO TAXI ACROSS IT INBOUND AND OUTBOUND. SEEMS LIKE A GOOD PLACE FOR VERY CLR INSTRUCTIONS EACH WAY. HUMAN PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS: STRANGE; BUSY ARPT; AT NIGHT; IN IMC CONDITIONS; REQUIRES EXTRA ATTN TO DETAIL. ENCOURAGE PLT TO ASK FOR HELP. ENCOURAGE TWR TO OFFER HELP (AND CLR; SIMPLIFIED INSTRUCTIONS) UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES.",,,,"C210 PLT HAD RWY INCURSION WHILE TAXIING TO RUNUP AREA.",

I NEEDED TO CROSS A SMALL MOUNTAIN RANGE; BUT WAS CONCERNED ABOUT FLYING DOWN AN UNFAMILIAR VALLEY IN MVFR. MY OTHER OPTION WAS TO TURN BACK TOWARD MY DEP; WHERE WX HAD DETERIORATED. AN ADDITIONAL ALTERNATIVE WAS TO SIMPLY FILE IFR AND CONTINUE THE FLT; WHICH IS WHAT I DID. A YR AGO; FILING IFR IN THIS ACFT; IN THE EXACT SAME SIT WAS PERFECTLY LEGAL; BUT SINCE AUG/98; THE FAA'S ELIMINATION OF 'LIMITED IFR' FOR SINGLE ENG ACFT OPERATING UNDER FAR PART 135 HAS MADE THIS A VIOLATION OF REGS.

SHE ALSO GAVE ME A CODE. THIS IS WHERE THE MISUNDERSTANDING COMES IN. AFTER ENTERING THE CLOUDS I TURNED BACK TO THE VOR AND ACTUALLY BROKE OUT AT ABOUT 2500 FT. DURING THIS MANEUVER I CONTACTED SEATTLE AND SHE SAID SHE HAD RADAR CONTACT AND TO CALL HER WHEN I WAS 'ON TOP.' I ASSUMED THIS EXCHANGE WAS ACTUALLY A CLRNC TO CONTINUE MY CLB AND REMOVED THE 3000 FT RESTR ASSUMING SHE WAS NOT CONCERNED WITH TFC CONFLICT AT THAT TIME. 'ON TOP' TO ME MEANS 1000 FT ABOVE THE DECK IN CTLED AIRSPACE. BY THE TIME I WAS ABLE TO MAKE CONTACT WITH HER; I WAS AT 4000 FT AND RPTED THAT I WAS OFFICIALLY 'ON TOP' HEADING DIRECT STS. I AM NOT SURE WHY; BUT SHE CLRED ME DIRECT TO STS. I HAD NOT FILED AN IFR FLT PLAN; BUT BOTH ZSE AND ZOA HANDLED THE FLT THAT WAY EVEN THOUGH WE WERE AT A VFR ON TOP ALT OF 9500 FT. A TWR CTLR AT STS TOLD ME; WHEN QUESTIONED; THAT HAVING ME IN RADAR CONTACT AND ASKING ME TO RPT WHEN 'ON TOP' IS NOT A CLRNC TO CLB THROUGH THE ALT RESTR GIVEN ON THE GND. ALSO I FIND MANY PLTS THINK THEY ARE 'ON TOP' THE MIN THEY BREAK THROUGH THE CLOUD DECK...TOO MANY.

I HAD LEFT THE HANGAR OPEN WITH MY CAR IN THE HANGAR. AFTER SECURING THE ACFT; I GOT IN MY CAR AND NOTICED THE WORDS; 'DO NOT FLY YOUR ACFT' ON THE BACK OF THE TAB. I WENT UP TO THE FBO TO ASK WHAT IT WAS ABOUT. I NOTICED A FEW TAGS HANGING ON RANDOM HANGARS. THE CHIEF FLT INSTRUCTOR WAS THERE; ALONG WITH A RECEPTIONIST. THERE WAS FOOD AND BOOZE OUT ON THE COUNTER. I ASKED WHAT THE PARTY WAS FOR; AND THEY TOLD ME THE FUEL WAS CONTAMINATED. I SPENT THE NEXT HR ON THE PHONE ATTEMPTING TO CONTACT SOME PEOPLE IN THE FIELD WHO I KNEW WOULD BE FLYING THE NEXT DAY. I FEEL THERE SHOULD BE SOME EFFORT MADE IN A TIMELY MANNER TO CONTACT PEOPLE. PERSONALLY; I FEEL THE HUE AND CRY OF SAFETY SHOULD RISE ABOVE ALL OTHER WORRIES OF IMAGE AND LIABILITY. PERHAPS IF FBO'S WERE REQUIRED TO KEEP A PHONE TREE OF ALL THEIR CUSTOMERS SO THEY COULD MAKE CALLS IN A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY. THIS CONTAMINATION DID CAUSE SERIOUS ENG DAMAGE. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE INITIAL REASON GIVEN THE RPTR WHEN HE HAD ASKED FOR FUEL THAT MORNING WAS THAT THE FUEL TRUCKS WERE OTS; NO MENTION MADE OF THE FUEL CONTAMINATION. THE NOTE RELATING TO NOT USING THE ACFT WAS POSTED ON THE HANGAR AFTER THE MORNING FLT WAS MADE. THE SUBJECT FUEL HAD BEEN DELIVERED TO THE STORAGE TANKS SOME DAYS PRIOR TO THIS RPTED EVENT. THE NEXT DAY AFTER THE DELIVERY; THE ACCOUNTANT DISCOVERED THE ERROR IN THE BILLING AS TO THE AMOUNT OF FUEL DELIVERED. THE TRUCK HAD 1000 GALLONS OF JET A FUEL IN IT PRIOR TO IT BEING FILLED WITH AVGAS BY THE DRIVER. WHEN HE REACHED 'FULL' ON; THE TRUCK HE HAD PUMPED 1000 GALLONS OF AVGAS LESS THAN PLANNED AND THEN REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD NOT RETURNED THE JET A FUEL TO THE OTHER TANKS PRIOR TO GASSING UP. HE WAS IN A HURRY AND FELT THAT THIS 10% JET A FUEL WOULD NOT MATTER. IT DID; TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT 200 ARPT BASED ACFT AND AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF TRANSIENT ACFT. THE COMMON COMPLAINT WAS EITHER CRACKED CRANKSHAFTS AND PISTON RODS OR 'FRIED' ENGS. THE RPTR HAD EXPERIENCED AN ENG FIRE ON ONE ACFT AND 2 ENGS ON ANOTHER THAT WOULD REQUIRE REPLACEMENTS. ANOTHER ACFT ABORTED ITS TKOF DUE TO POOR PERFORMANCE AND MADE A VAN RUN OFF THE ROAD WHEN HE WENT OFF THE END OF THE RWY NEARBY. THE FAA LCL OFFICE WAS CONTACTED BY THE RPTR.

UPON ARR IN SAN FELIPE; BAJA; 30 MORE GALLONS OF FUEL WERE ORDERED FOR THE ACFT. THE TRIP THEN PROCEEDED TO THE W SIDE OF THE BAJA PENINSULA WHERE THE PLANE WAS PARKED OVERNIGHT. DURING PREFLT INSPECTION FOR THE RETURN TRIP; I WAS UNABLE TO LOCATE A LADDER OR ANY OTHER DEVICE TO GET UP HIGH ENOUGH TO VISUALLY INSPECT THE FUEL CONTENTS OF THE ACFT. THE FUEL GAUGES INDICATED OVER 1/2 TANK IN EACH OF THE WINGS. THE INDICATION WAS CONSISTENT WITH PREFLT PLANNING AND CALCULATIONS. THE TRIP PROCEEDED TO THE E SIDE OF BAJA WITH A STOP IN SAN FELIPE. PRIOR TO DEP; THE FUEL GAUGES WERE INDICATING OVER 100 LBS OF FUEL IN EACH TANK. APPROX 50 MINS INTO THIS LEG; WHILE ON THE R TANK; THE ENG SPUTTERED. THE TANK WAS IMMEDIATELY SWITCHED TO THE L TANK AND THE ENG RAN SMOOTHLY. BOTH TANKS WERE NOW INDICATING ABOUT 25 LBS. MY INTENTION AT THIS POINT WAS TO LAND AT THE NEAREST ARPT. THE GPS INDICATED THAT SELLS; AZ; OR ROCKY POINT; MEXICO; WERE THE CHOICES. I DECIDED ON THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FIELD; SINCE I HAD CLRED OUT OF MEXICO. 5-10 MINS LATER; THE ENG SPUTTERED AND QUIT.

THE R WING OF THE ACFT SUSTAINED VERY MINOR DAMAGE WHEN IT STRUCK A CACTUS. AT THIS TIME IT HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED WHAT CAUSED THIS INCIDENT. SEVERAL FACTORS COULD BE CONSIDERED. POOR FUEL QUALITY; FAULTY FUEL GAUGES; FUEL WAS SIPHONED FROM THE ACFT WHILE SITTING OVERNIGHT; AND/OR A FUEL LEAK; ESPECIALLY DURING THE LAST LEG. CALCULATING AND RECALCULATING THE TRIP FUEL REQUIREMENTS SHOWS A VERY CONSERVATIVE 80 GALLONS OF FUEL FOR THE ROUND TRIP. RECORDS SHOW THAT 108 GALLONS WERE SUPPOSEDLY PLACED IN THE AIRPLANE.

HE HAD APPROX 10 HRS IN THE ACFT AND I HAD APPROX 4 HRS IN TYPE ALONG WITH 20 HRS IN A SIMULATOR OF SIMILAR TYPE ACFT. I WAS IFR CURRENT AND PROFICIENT AS I HAD FLOWN OVER 10 INST APCHS WITHIN THE LAST MONTH AND HAD LOGGED OVER 5 HRS UNDER THE HOOD. WE TOOK OFF FROM NOVATO; CA; AT APPROX AB45 AM IN VFR CONDITIONS AND HEADED N. WE HAD RECEIVED A WX BRIEFING FROM FSS. THE WX LOOKED VFR IN ALL AREAS EXCEPT FOR THE NORTHERN PART OF CALIFORNIA EXTENDING INTO OREGON AND WASHINGTON. WE DECIDED TO LAND IN ARCATA; CA; FOR FUEL AND LUNCH. THE WX THERE WAS MARGINAL IFR SO I CALLED FSS AND FILED A 'POP-UP' CLRNC. THIS WAS AT APPROX 40 MI FROM ARCATA. I THEN SWITCHED TO THE CTR FREQ AND REQUESTED THE IFR CLRNC. THEY HAD NOT RECEIVED THE CLRNC AS OF YET AND I WAS STILL AT 8500 FT MSL. I WAS FLYING FROM THE R SEAT AND MY STUDENT HAD RECEIVED 40-50 HRS OF INST INSTRUCTION FROM ME. CTR FINALLY CLRED ME TO 6500 FT AND HAD RECEIVED THE CLRNC. AS I WAS DSNDING TO 6500 FT MSL; I WAS WITHIN 15 MI OF THE ARCATA ARPT. CTR ASKED IF I WOULD ACCEPT A CLRNC 'VECTORS DIRECT TO THE LOC AND STILL BE ABLE TO DSND IN TIME?' I REPLIED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE AND PROCEEDED INBOUND TO THE OM ON A 020 DEG HDG PER ATC INSTRUCTIONS. I INTERCEPTED THE LOC AND NOT LONG THEREAFTER; THE GS. THE GS HAD SOMEWHAT ERRATIC INDICATIONS WITH CLOSE TO FULL SCALE UP AND DOWN DEFLECTION FOR A SECOND OR TWO. WE HAD DONE A VOR CHK EARLIER IN THE DAY AND LOGGED IT IN THE ACFT RECORDS. THE #1 VOR WAS WITHIN +/-1 DEG AND THE #2 VOR WAS WITHIN +/-2 DEGS. I CONFIGURED THE ACFT PASSING THE OM AT ACATA INTXN AND STARTED THE TIMER. WE WERE; I THOUGHT; A LITTLE HIGH BUT THE GS WAS RECEIVING AND SHOWED ME ON THE GS. THE GS DID FLUCTUATE A BIT BUT NOTHING TO MAKE ME ALARMED. I WAS DSNDING AND THE NEXT THING I HEARD WAS THE MM AND MY ALT WAS 5200 FT MSL. I DID NOT SEE ANYTHING SO I PROCEEDED TO THE MISSED APCH. HOWEVER; I WAS MUCH HIGHER THAN THE ALT STATED IN THE MISSED APCH PROC. THE MAP STATED A CLB ALT OF 3000 FT MSL AND I WAS ALREADY AT 5200 FT MSL. I WAS CLBING THROUGH 6500 FT WHEN I SPOKE WITH CTR AGAIN. THEY ASKED WHY I WAS STILL CLBING AND AT THAT POINT; I STATED THAT WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE AVOIDED THE MOUNTAINS. I ADVISED THAT WE WERE GOING 'MISSED' AND CTR ADVISED TO HOLD AT THE MISSED APCH HOLD POINT OF TRIAL. AT THIS POINT; I WAS CONFUSED AS TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WAS NOT TRUSTING MY INSTS. HOW COULD I BE CLOSE TO 4000 FT HIGHER THAN I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WHEN I WAS RECEIVING THE GS? AS I WAS HOLDING OVER TRIAL; A STRANGE NOISE BEGAN TO BE HEARD IN THE COCKPIT. I ASKED CTR IF WE COULD CLB TO 10000 FT MSL AND THEY ACCEPTED AND ALSO TOLD ME TO HOLD AT FORTUNA VOR; N; R TURNS. I ACCEPTED AND BEGAN CLBING. AT 9500 FT; WE BROKE OUT OF THE CLOUDS AND THE STRANGE NOISE STOPPED. WE NEVER FIGURED OUT WHAT THE STRANGE NOISE WAS. AT THIS POINT; WE PROCEEDED TO REDDING; CA; WHERE THE WX WAS VFR AND WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO COMPLETE AN INST APCH. I WAS NOT TRUSTING THE INST IN THE ACFT; EVEN THOUGH ALL MY TRAINING HAD SAID TO TRUST THE INSTS. AFTER WE LANDED; I ANALYZED THE SIT A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY AND CAME TO THE DETERMINATION THAT BECAUSE OF MY INITIAL ALT ON THE APCH; I HAD RECEIVED A 'FALSE GS.' IN ACCEPTING THE CLRNC TO PROCEED STRAIGHT IN AT MY HIGH ALT; I WAS ACCEPTING A MISSED APCH RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. THIS WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT I DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE FALSE GS RIGHT AWAY LIKE I SHOULD HAVE BY XREFING MY ALT WITH THAT OF THE PROPER ALT OF THE APCH PROC. DUE TO THIS LATE RECOGNITION; I WAS MUCH HIGHER ON THE APCH. THIS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO MY DISTRUST OF THE INSTS AND WHAT THEY WERE TELLING ME. IN LOOKING BACK AT WHAT TRANSPIRED; I SHOULD HAVE NEVER ACCEPTED THE STRAIGHT IN CLRNC FOR THE ILS APCH AT ARCATA. I WAS IN A FAIRLY NEW AIRPLANE FOR MYSELF AND WAS FLYING FROM THE R SEAT IN INST CONDITIONS THAT I HAD NOT BEEN IN FOR A FEW MONTHS. THIS LED TO SOME DISORIENTATION AND AN UNSURE FEELING OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING. I SHOULD HAVE ASKED FOR VECTORS TO GET DOWN TO THE PROPER INTERCEPT ALT BEFORE PROCEEDING INBOUND ON THE APCH. I ALSO DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE FALSE GS DURING THE APCH. THANKFULLY; MY TRAINING HAD INGRAINED IN ME THE TRUST OF INSTS I NEEDED IN ORDER TO SAFELY AVERT AND POSSIBLE CFIT OR OTHER POSSIBLE HAZARD BY GOING AROUND AT THE PROPER POINT.",,,,"A CFI AND HIS STUDENT IN A TURBO C210 MAKES AN ATTEMPT AT AN ILS INTO ARCADIA BUT PERFORM A MISSED APCH WHEN OVER THE MM SOME 5000 FT ABOVE THE PUBLISHED XING ALT; 1 MI SE OF ACV; CA.",

MEANWHILE I STARTED TO RECEIVE A HDOF OF A SBOUND PA31 AT 8000 FT THAT WOULD BE A CONFLICTION WITH THE PA31 I WAS ALREADY WORKING; SO I TOOK A MOMENT OR TWO TO DECIDE HOW I WOULD HANDLE THE SIT. DURING THIS TIME; THE CENTURION LEFT 8000 FT AND TURNED TOWARD PUT AND THE PA31. IF THERE REALLY HAD BEEN 5 MI BTWN THEM TO START EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE; BUT AS THERE WAS ONLY 3.5 MI; I LOST STANDARD SEPARATION VERY SHORTLY AFTER THE C210 BEGIN HIS TURN TOWARD PUT.

I GOT NO ANSWER; AND I STARTED A TURN TO THE R. I DID NOT MAKE A SECOND ATTEMPT TO CONTACT THE TWR. A MIN OR 2 LATER; AFTER I WAS ALREADY IN THE CLBING R TURN; I WAS INSTRUCTED TO CONTACT UPON CONTACTING CTR; THEY NOTED I HAD TURNED R INSTEAD OF L; AND IT TURNED OUT THEY HAD A INBND ACFT (COMING FROM THE WE AND A LNDG ON RWY 10; I BELIEVE). AS FAR AS I KNOW; AT NO POINT WAS THERE A TFC CONFLICT. AT THAT POINT; MY RECOLLECTION OF WHAT WAS SAID IS HAZY. I CONTINUED MY TURN TOWARD THE W; AND A MIN OR SO LATER; CTR THEN ASKED MY HDG -- 'TURNING THROUGH 260 DEGS TO 290DEGS.' APPARENTLY; AFTER THE INITIAL CALL TO CTR; THEY HAD TOLD ME TO TURN TO A HDG OF 120 DEGS; BUT I DO NOT REMEMBER THAT CALL; AND AM FAIRLY SURE I DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE SUCH INSTRUCTIONS. AT THAT POINT; CTR TOLD ME TO TURN TO 360 DEGS; AND LEVEL OFF AT 2000 FT. THAT PUT ME OVER THE ARPT. SEVERAL MI N OF THE FIELD; I WAS TOLD TO TURN L ON COURSE AND CLB TO MY CRUISING ALT. CTR ALSO MADE CLR THAT THEY WERE UNHAPPY THAT I HAD NOT FOLLOWED INSTRUCTIONS. THEY ASKED IF I HAD RECEIVED TWR'S 'TURN L AFTER TKOF' AND I CONFIRMED THAT I HAD. I MENTIONED MY ABORTED ATTEMPT TO GET CLARIFICATION FROM TWR BUT THEY DISMISSED THAT. IN REVIEWING THIS INCIDENT; IT IS CLR THAT I GOOFED IN NOT TURNING L. I SHOULD HAVE INSISTED ON A RESPONSE FROM TWR WHEN I QUESTIONED THE 'L OR R' INSTRUCTION. ALTERNATIVELY; GETTING ON RESPONSE FROM TWR; I SHOULD HAVE CONTINUED ON A RWY HDG AND ASKED CTR WHAT THEY WANTED M TO DO RATHER THAN MAKING THE ASSUMPTION I DID. FATIGUE PROBABLY PLAYED A PART SINCE I HAD ALREADY FLOWN 3 AND A HALF HRS FROM THE BALTIMORE AREA; IN IFR AND TURBULENT CONDITIONS. ALSO; THEY RELATIVELY GOOD LCL WX (5000 FT OVERCAST AND 10 MIL VISIBILITY); AND APPARENT LACK OF OTHER ACFT; DULLED MY VIGILANCE. WITH RESPECT TO THE INSTRUCTION TO 'TURN TO 120 DEGS;' I REALLY HAVE NO EXPLANATION OTHER THAN MY MIND WAS PROBABLY OCCUPIED WITH THE 'WHY DID YOU TURN R WHEN YOU SHOULD HAVE TURNED L' REBUKE FROM CTR.",,,,"A C-T210 PLT TURNED THE WRONG WAY DURING AN IFR DEP FROM TVC.",

I FELT THE LEFT GEAR TOUCH THE GND; AND THEN I NOTICED THAT THE ACFT STARTED TILTING TO THE RIGHT. MY FIRST REACTION WAS TO APPLY LEFT AILERON AND RUDDER TO CORRECT FOR WHAT I THOUGHT WAS DRIFT. AFTER 1 OR 2 SECS; I HEARD A BANGING SOUND WITH BREAKING NOISE FROM ACFT. AT THAT INSTANT; I REALIZED THAT MY RIGHT MAIN GEAR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN DOWN. SO I ADDED FULL PWR TO INITIATE A GAR; BUT BY THAT TIME THE ACFT WAS BADLY DAMAGED. SO I REDUCED THROTTLE TO IDLE AND CUT THE MIXTURE. I TRIED TO STABILIZE THE ACFT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

AT NIGHT I CANNOT SEE MY GEAR AND TRUSTED MY GEAR LIGHT. MY PWR WAS BACK XING THE THRESHOLD AND I LOOKED TO BE ON SPD AND ON CTR. MY AIM POINT WAS 1000 FT DOWN ON CTRLINE. I FLARED THE AIRPLANE FOR TOUCHDOWN AND FELT THE MAIN GEAR FOLLOWED BY THE NOSEWHEEL TOUCHDOWN. I THOUGHT THAT I HAD GREASED THE LNDG AND WAS QUITE HAPPY. THE PLANE SEEMED TO HOLD A LNDG ATTITUDE AS IT SLOWED DOWN. THE PLANE THEN BEGAN TO LEAN BACK AS IF THE GEAR WAS ROLLING BACK.

I THOUGHT FIRST OF APPLYING PWR TO GO AROUND; BUT CHOOSE TO FIGHT TO KEEP THE AIRPLANE ON CTRLINE AND STOP STRAIGHT AHEAD DUE TO SLOW SPD AND CTLABILITY. AS THE PLANE CAME TO A STOP; IT HOOKED TO THE L 180 DEGS AND CAME TO REST FACING THE APCH END ON THE RWY AND LEANING ON ITS R SIDE. I SHUT THE ENG OFF AND CALLED THE TWR TO RPT THE MISHAP AND THAT I WAS ALL RIGHT.

THIS WAS CAUSED BY A SERIES OF ERRORS. I WAS TAKING A VACATION IN FT LAUDERDALE. DURING THE WEEK; I DECIDED TO FLY DOWN TO KEY WEST AND EXPLORE THE ISLAND. BECAUSE I HAD NEVER FLOWN IN S FL BELOW FEX; I DID A LOT OF PREFLT PLANNING. I FAILED TO COPY THE IDENTIFIER FOR KEY WEST AND THEN WENT TO THE TRIP PLANNER I HAD DOWNLOADED ON MY COMPUTER. WHEN I TYPED IN KEY WEST; THE PROGRAM BROUGHT UP THE IDENTIFIER FOR THE NAVAL MARINE STATION (NQX); WHICH I SUBSEQUENTLY RETAINED AS THE IDENTIFIER FOR KEY WEST ARPT. AT THIS POINT; I HAD NO IDEA THAT THERE WAS A NAVAL STATION ARPT IN PROXIMITY TO KEY WEST. PRIOR TO MY DEP; I CALLED FSS AND OBTAINED A WX BRIEFING AND ASKED ABOUT ANY SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FLYING IN THE KEYS. HE INDICATED THAT MY ONLY CONCERN WAS TO AVOID THE RESTR AREA AROUND MIL BASE IN S FL. HE INDICATED THAT IF I FLEW TO THE E OF THE KEYS; I WOULD AVOID THAT AREA COMPLETELY. NO MENTION WAS MADE OF THE TETHERED BALLOON NEAR KEY WEST. ON ARR AT FEX; I INQUIRED ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF AN INSTRUCTOR TO BRIEF ME ON THE FLT PROCS FOR NEGOTIATING THE AIRSPACE AROUND MIAMI AND FT LAUDERDALE INTL ARPTS AND NONE WAS AVAILABLE. THE DESK CLERK ADVISED ME THAT MIAMI WOULD LET ME FLY DOWN THE E COAST WITHOUT ANY PROBS. I ALSO REVIEWED THE MAPS IN THE FLT PREPARATION ROOM WITHOUT NOTICING THE NAVAL STATION AIRFIELD. AFTER TAKEOFF; I WAS GIVEN 5 HANDOFFS TO DIFFERENT FACILITIES BEFORE ANYONE ACTUALLY TRIED TO IDENTIFY MY FLT. BY THAT TIME; I HAD FLOWN WELL OFF THE COAST TO THE E AND DECIDED TO CLB TO 7500 FT TO OVERFLY THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE MIAMI CLASS B AIRSPACE BEFORE TURNING TOWARDS KEY WEST. I WAS FINALLY ID'D BY APCH. I WAS USING HAND HELD GPS EQUIPMENT. I; FOR THE FIRST TIME; REALIZED THAT THERE WAS A MIL FACILITY IN THE AREA. UNFORTUNATELY; I CONTINUED TO UTILIZE THE GPS FOR GUIDANCE TO KEY WEST AND ENTERED THE INCORRECT NQX INTO THE COMPUTER. E OF PINE ISLAND; I CALLED NAVAL APCH AND WAS GIVEN A SQUAWK CODE AND FLT FOLLOWING. I WAS INFORMED TO REMAIN 3 MILES OFF THE COAST OF THE ISLAND TO THE S DUE TO A FLT OF 3 MIL JETS INCOMING. I SAW THE MIL AIRFIELD AND REMAINED TO THE S UNTIL I COULD SEE THE AIRSTRIP AT KEY WEST. I WAS HANDED OFF TO THE KEY WEST CTLR WHO DIRECTED ME TO ENTER A RIGHT BASE FOR RWY 9. AT THIS POINT; I BECAME CONFUSED; AS THE GPS INDICATED THAT I WAS PASSING W OF KEY WEST ARPT. LOOKING TO THE N; I DIDN'T SEE ANY INDICATION OF MIL ACFT ON THE GND NOR DID I SEE ANY MIL LIKE FACILITIES; SO I ASSUMED THAT I WAS NOW FLYING TOWARDS THE NAVAL AIR STATION INSTEAD OF KEY WEST. I THEN TURNED TO THE N AND ENDED UP OVERFLYING THE MIL AIRFIELD. THE KEY WEST CTLR FINALLY REALIZED THE ERROR I WAS MAKING AND DIRECTED ME TO IMMEDIATELY FLY TO THE N TO AVOID THE INCOMING MIL FLT. SHE GAVE ME VECTORS FINALLY CLRING ME TO ENTER A RIGHT DOWNWIND FOR RWY 9. I THEN PANICKED AT THE REALIZATION OF THE FACT THAT I HAD VIOLATED A MIL BASE AIRSPACE. I SUBSEQUENTLY BECAME COMPLETELY DISORIENTED AS TO THE DIRECTION I WAS FLYING AND HOW TO SET UP THE APCH TO LAND. FORTUNATELY; THE CTLR WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE UNTIL I COULD GET REORIENTED; BUT NOT BEFORE I ENTERED THE PATTERN INCORRECTLY AT KEY WEST. THE LNDG WAS UNEVENTFUL. I HAVE REALIZED THAT DESPITE MY GOOD EFFORTS TO PLAN THIS FLT AND USE ALL THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE; I MADE A BASIC ERROR IN NOT UTILIZING A CURRENT SECTIONAL; WHICH I HAD AVAILABLE IN THE COCKPIT; AND INQUIRING WITH THE CTLR WHEN I BECAME CONFUSED AS TO THE CORRECT LOCATION OF THE AIRFIELD.

IN SUMMARY; I WAS ON AN IFR FLT FROM FUNY TO FRAP TO VIEW THE MOUNT RUSHMORE AND CRAZY HORSE MONUMENTS; WHEN ON FINAL APCH TO RAP; I EXPERIENCED A SANDEL/DIRECTIONAL GYRO MALFUNCTION; WHICH CAUSED ME TO BELIEVE THAT I WAS INBOUND ON THE VOR RWY 14 APCH TO FRAP.

I HAD ALREADY FILED A VFR FLT PLAN FROM VAN NUYS ARPT TO CAMARILLO ARPT AND BACK. I WAS EVEN GIVEN A SPECIAL SQUAWK CODE BECAUSE OF THE TFR ISSUED WITHIN A 30 MI RADIUS OF SANTA MONICA. I ASSUMED THAT THE TERM 'CARRIER NO VOICE' MEANT THAT FOR SOME REASON THEY WERE SUSPENDING VOICE COMS. I ASSUMED THIS BECAUSE THE FLT PLAN THAT I FILED WAS FROM VAN NUYS TO CAMARILLO AND BACK; TECHNICALLY MY VFR FLT PLAN WAS STILL IN EFFECT. AS I WAS TAXIING ON THE RAMP TOWARD THE TXWY; I CONTACTED GND CTL ONCE MORE AND WAS TOLD 'TOBAGO CALLING; CARRIER NO VOICE.' THIS REASSURED ME THAT I HAD CLRNC TO TAXI SINCE THEY IDENTED MY PLANE NOW MOBILE ON THE RAMP. YET I WAS STILL BOTHERED BY THIS PROC; SO I MADE SURE TO CHK VISUALLY THE TWR FOR ANY LIGHT SIGNALS. DURING TAXIING; I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY LIGHT SIGNALS FROM THE TWR. I WAS THEN IN THE RUN-UP AREA WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT GND AGAIN TO CLARIFY THE SIT. THEY REPLIED 'CARRIER NO VOICE; IF YOU ARE CONTACTING GND CLICK YOUR MIKE 2 TIMES.' I COMPLIED AND CLICKED MY MIKE 2 TIMES AND THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THIS SAYING 'WE GOT YOUR CLICKS.' AGAIN; I INTERPRETED THIS AS A CLRNC BECAUSE THEY HEARD AND ACKNOWLEDGED MY MIKE CLICKS. I FINISHED MY RUN-UP AND TAXIED TO AND HELD SHORT OF THE RWY. WHILE DOING THIS; I CONTACTED THE TWR FREQ AND WAS TOLD VERY POLITELY; 'CARRIER NO VOICE.' I CONTINUED TO TAXI UP TO THE HOLDING SHORT LINE OF THE ACTIVE RWY WHEN THE TWR SAID 'TOBAGO ON THE ACTIVE; TURN AROUND AND RETURN TO YOUR STARTING PLACE. YOU ARE NOT CLRED FOR TKOF; I REPEAT; YOU ARE NOT CLRED FOR TKOF.' IT WAS NOW OBVIOUS THAT WE HAD NOT ESTABLISHED PROPER 2-WAY COMS AT THIS POINT AND I IMMEDIATELY COMPLIED WITH THEIR INSTRUCTIONS AND TAXIED BACK TO MY DEP POINT. THE TRUE ISSUE HERE WAS NOT THE MEANING OF 'CARRIER NO VOICE' OR MY INTERP OF THIS PHRASE. IN MY MIND; THE MAIN ISSUE WAS IN ASSUMING FACTS NOT IN EVIDENCE. AS MY CALLS WERE NOT ANSWERED; I SHOULD HAVE SHUTDOWN AND RETHOUGHT THE SIT: IF IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT; IT IS PROBABLY NOT THE RIGHT SIT TO BE IN.

PRIOR TO THE FLT I CONTACTED WXBRIEF FOR THE LATEST NOTAMS AND ANY LCL DEP PROCS FOR VFR. I WAS ACQUAINTED AND HAD PERFORMED AN IFR DEP IN SEP 2001. THE SPECIALIST WAS BASED IN RENO BUT GAVE ME THE LCL LAS VEGAS APCH FREQS I WOULD MOST LIKELY RECEIVE. I WAS GIVEN A HEADING BY VGT TWR AND AFTER TKOF HANDED OFF TO LAS VEGAS DEP CTL.

MY P210N; WHICH I HAVE FLOWN FOR 12 YRS; RUNS A VERY HIGH OIL TEMP ON A HOT DAY AND I WAS APPARENTLY NOT CLBING FAST ENOUGH FOR THE CTLR SO HE GAVE ME A HEADING CHANGE TO THE E RATHER THAN THE 220 DEG HDG I HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN GIVEN. I EXPLAINED THAT MY OIL TEMP WAS AT REDLINE AND HE ASKED IF I NEEDED ASSISTANCE. I INFORMED HIM THAT MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE AIRPLANE WAS THAT IT WOULD COOL ADEQUATELY GIVEN SUFFICIENT AIRSPD AND REDUCED CLB RATE. AT SOME POINT HE ASKED FOR AN EXPEDITED TURN BUT I ESTIMATE I WAS ALREADY AT A 30-45 DEG BANK. I WAS NEVER GIVEN; OR HEARD OF; ANY TFC ALTHOUGH AN ACR B737 WAS HAVING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES AND ASKED TO DEVIATE TO UNUSED AIRSPACE TO WORK THROUGH A CHKLIST. THE CTLR REPEATED IF THE ACR NEEDED ASSISTANCE TO WHICH THE CREW REPLIED THEY SIMPLY NEEDED TO RUN A CHKLIST TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF AN ANOMALY. I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF THIS HAD AN EFFECT ON MY FLT AS I WAS EVENTUALLY DIRECTED THROUGH A SERIES OF CLBS AND TURNS TO MY FIRST WAYPOINT; GOF VOR W OF MCCARRAN. BEFORE LEAVING THE FREQ; THE LAST CTLR ASKED ME TO CALL A NUMBER WHEN I LANDED AT THERMAL; WHICH I BELIEVE HE SAID WAS LAS VEGAS APCH CTL. I MADE A NOTE OF THE NUMBER ON A POST-IT ON MY FLT PLAN. BUT; DURING THE UNLOADING PROCESS AT DESERT RESORTS REGIONAL IN THE 112 DEG HEAT; THE NOTE DISAPPEARED.

I HAVE NOTICED A TREND HOWEVER IN RECENT YRS THAT IN PHOENIX AND LAS VEGAS VFR OR IFR APCHS IN CLR WX TO ADJOINING ARPTS; I HAVE BEEN DIRECTED TO 'FLY OVER THE NUMBERS.'

THE ACFT'S FUEL TANKS WERE NOT FULL; BUT THE GAUGES INDICATED BETTER THAN HALF TANKS ON BOTH SIDES. MY ERROR CAME WHEN I STUCK THE TANKS. I WAS FEELING A LITTLE RUSHED AND I DID NOT TAKE CLOSE NOTICE TO THE EXACT AMOUNT OF FUEL ON THE STICK. I SIMPLY NOTED THERE WAS FUEL ON THE STICK; AND REMEMBERED WHAT THE GAUGES SHOWED; SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN HALF TANKS. THE FLT TODAY WAS UNEVENTFUL. I DID NOT RE-STICK THE FUEL TANKS IN DAY BECAUSE I HAD ALREADY DETERMINED THAT I HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH FUEL FOR THE RETURN TRIP; AND THE FUEL GAUGES AGREED. I DEPARTED DAY AND WAS BURNING OFF THE R TANK BECAUSE IT HAD A HIGHER FUEL INDICATION; AND I TRY TO KEEP THE TANKS WITHIN ABOUT A QUARTER OF EACH OTHER. I WAS IN CRUISE FLT AT 3500 FT MSL; WHEN I DETERMINED IT WAS TIME TO SWITCH TO THE FULLER L TANK. I SWITCHED TO THE L SIDE AND MONITORED MY FUEL FLOW GAUGE FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND EVERYTHING APPEARED NORMAL. AFTER SEVERAL MINS THE ENG SHUT DOWN. I PUSHED THE MIXTURE RICH AND TURNED ON THE FUEL PUMP. NEITHER OF THOSE 2 ACTIONS CORRECTED THE PROB SO I IMMEDIATELY DECLARED AN EMER WITH DAY APCH CTL. I ALSO SQUAWKED 7700.

I WAS THEN AT APPROX 1800 FT MSL; AND COMMITTED TO AN OPEN FIELD TO MY SW. AS I WAS GETTING READY TO INITIATE MY TURN TO FINAL APCH; THE ENG FIRED AND BEGAN RUNNING AGAIN NORMALLY. I ABORTED MY APCH TO THE FIELD; ALERTED DAY APCH AND LANDED THE ACFT NORMALLY AT I23. THE L FUEL TANK TOOK 44.2 GALS OF FUEL. THE POH SAYS IT HOLDS 45 GALS; WITH APPROX .5 GAL UNUSABLE. THE R TANK TOOK APPROX 21 GALS. THE OBVIOUS CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT IS THAT I STARVED THE ENG OF FUEL WHEN I SWITCHED TO THE L TANK IN CRUISE. MY POOR ASSESSMENT OF THE FUEL SIT ON PREFLT AND NOT CHKING IT AGAIN IN DAY BEFORE DEP WERE LEADING CAUSES FOR THIS INCIDENT. IN MY OWN DEFENSE; THE L FUEL GAUGE WAS VERY INACCURATE. WHEN THE ENG QUIT INFLT; THE GAUGE WAS READING SLIGHTLY LESS THAN HALF TANK; WHICH WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME APPROX 20 GALS OF FUEL. IT REMAINED AT THIS INDICATION UNTIL REFUELING AT I23; WHERE AFTERWARDS RETURNED TO A FULL INDICATION. I WAS DECEIVED BY AN INACCURATE FUEL GAUGE.

RATHER THAN TURNING BACK TO RED BLUFF OR REDDING; OR DIVERTING TO SACRAMENTO (ONLY 10 MINS CLOSER THAN NAPA); I CHOSE TO PROCEED TO NAPA; WITH AN ETE OF 40 MINS.

BASED ON PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE IN A T210; I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE 1 HR OF BATTERY PWR; BUT THE BATTERY LASTED ONLY 30 MINS IN THIS PLANE.

WHAT I THINK I DID WRONG WAS TO ASSUME THAT ALL TFR'S WERE TO BE A FIXED DISTANCE FROM AN ESTABLISHED NAVAID; IE; A VOR. WHEN I HEARD THE FAA WX BRIEFER MENTION A FIX FROM THE VENTURA VOR OF A 037 DEGS AND 5.7 MI; I TOOK THIS TO MEAN THAT THE TFR WAS TO PROTECT SOMETHING FROM THAT LOCATION; NOT THAT THE 30 MI RADIUS WAS TO ORIGINATE FROM THAT POS. THIS OF COURSE EXTENDED THE RESTR AREA MORE EASTERLY THAN I HAD THOUGHT. CONCLUSION; I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED THE FAST TALKING BRIEFER TO ASK SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND NOT ASSUME ANYTHING.

ATC SUGGESTED BOULDER CITY ARPT; ABOUT 15 NM AWAY; BUT BY THAT TIME; I HAD USED THE NEAREST-ARPT FEATURE OF MY GPS TO LOCATE ECHO BAY ARPT 8.8 NM AWAY. I TURNED TOWARD ECHO BAY AND SOME MINS LATER BROUGHT THE ACFT TO A NORMAL LNDG ON RWY 24. THE CAUSE OF THIS EVENT WAS FUEL STARVATION RESULTING FROM MY FAILURE TO SWITCH TANKS IN A TIMELY MANNER. I DID NOT RECOGNIZE THIS CAUSE WHILE IN THE AIR; BECAUSE THE PLANE APPEARED TO HAVE PARTIAL PWR. I LATER REALIZED THAT I HAVE HAD LITTLE EXPERIENCE WITH A WIND-MILLING PROP. IT APPEARED TO BE TURNING AT LOW PWR; AND IT SEEMED TO SHOW SOME SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN ENG CTL POS. AFTER DOING SOME TESTS ON THE GND; I DETERMINED THE PROB; SWITCHED TANKS; RESTARTED; AND PROCEEDED UNEVENTFULLY TO MCCARRAN ARPT. I HAVE FLOWN THE ACFT FOR ABOUT 800 HRS; INCLUDING MANY LONG LEGS. I HAVE NEVER FAILED TO FOLLOW MY STANDARD TANK-SWITCHING PROC (30 MINS ON L FOR TKOF AND CLB; SWITCH TO R; AND SWITCH EVERY HR AFTERWARDS). I ALWAYS NOTE THE TIMES FOR SWITCHING IN A FUEL LOG ON MY KNEEBOARD. IN THIS CASE; I OMITTED A STANDARD PROC FOR NO OBVIOUS REASON. A SECOND ISSUE IS MY FAILURE TO DIAGNOSE THE PROB ONCE IT OCCURRED. 'BOOST PUMP ON; SWITCH TANKS' IS A STANDARD PROC FOR ENG FAILURE; AND I DO IT WELL EVERY YEAR AT A FLT SCHOOL. MY FAILURE TO DO IT IN THIS CASE MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS. ONE IS THE IMPRESSION OF PARTIAL PWR. SECOND; MY ENG IS NOT TOO FAR FROM TBO; SO I WAS WILLING TO BELIEVE MECHANICAL FAILURE HAD OCCURRED.

THIS FLT WAS PLANNED FROM NEW ENGLAND TO THE MID-ATLANTIC REGION WITH MY WIFE. A TELEPHONE BRIEFING WAS OBTAINED 30 MINS BEFORE DEP WHICH RPTED A WIDESPREAD AREA OF EXCELLENT WX COVERING THE NE AND MID-ATLANTIC. AS USUAL; I SPECIFICALLY INQUIRED ABOUT TFR'S INCLUDING THE EXTENT OF P40. THE BRIEFER REPLIED THAT NOTAMS SHOWED NO TFR'S; P40 WAS '10 MI;' AND 'DID I KNOW ABOUT THE WASHINGTON ADIZ?' I CONFIRMED THAT I WAS AWARE OF THE ADIZ; AND INTENDED TO REMAIN WELL CLR OF RESTR AIRSPACE. IN RETROSPECT; HOWEVER; I DIDN'T KNOW QUITE ENOUGH ABOUT THE VERT EXTENT OF THAT ADIZ. MOST OF MY FLYING (ESPECIALLY SINCE 911) HAS BEEN IFR. HOWEVER; ON THIS OCCASION; SINCE THE WX WAS EXCELLENT; I ELECTED TO FLY VFR BECAUSE WE WANTED TO TAKE AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS OF CERTAIN SITES; AND I WANTED TIME TO GAIN FAMILIARITY WITH RECENTLY INSTALLED AVIONICS. AN ADDITIONAL FACTOR FAVORING VFR WAS THE VERY LIMITED (AND CIRCUITOUS) RTES PERMITTED THROUGH THE NEW YORK AND DULLES AREAS. THERE ARE ONLY 2 CHOICES: V16 DOWN THE EASTERN SHORE; OR ROUTINGS QUITE FAR TO THE N OF BOTH METRO AREAS. I HAVE FLOWN THESE RTES MANY TIMES AND AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH NAV; BOTH VISUALLY AND USING NAVAIDS. THE CRUISE PORTION OF THE FLT WAS PLANNED AT 10500 FT TO SAFELY CLR CLASS B AIRSPACE IN NEW YORK; PHILADELPHIA AND WASHINGTON. I MONITORED VARIOUS APCH; CTR AND GUARD FREQS AS THE FLT PROGRESSED; BUT DID NOT REQUEST VFR ADVISORIES (WHICH TYPICALLY INVOLVES AT LEAST 20-SOME FREQ CHANGES; ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS AND CHK-INS). THE FLT WAS UNEVENTFUL UNTIL 50 MI N OF WASHINGTON; AT WHICH POINT I RECHKED NAV TO ASSURE PASSING WELL CLR OF P40. AS THE FLT PROGRESSED TO THE WSW; I BECAME AWARE THAT WE MIGHT OVERFLY A SMALL SLICE OF THE WASHINGTON CLASS B AIRSPACE. IT WAS MY RECOLLECTION (ERRONEOUSLY) THAT THE ADIZ DID NOT EXTEND ABOVE THE CLASS B AIRSPACE; HOWEVER; I BEGAN A CAREFUL RECHK OF THE CURRENT WASHINGTON SECTIONAL TRYING TO VERIFY THE EXTENT OF THE CLASS B; PROHIBITED AREA(S) AND ADIZ. THE CLASS B AND PROHIBITED AREAS ARE CLRLY CHARTED; HOWEVER; THE ADIZ IS NOT. YES; THERE IS A BOX NOTING SPECIAL FLT RULES REFERRING TO A 'DESCRIPTION IN CHART BORDER.' HOWEVER; THIS REQUIRES REVERSING THE CHART AND SEARCHING FOR FINE PRINT. EVENTUALLY; THE BORDER NOTE DESCRIBES THE 'SPECIAL FLT RULES' GIVING COORDINATES; WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO INTERP QUICKLY WHILE FLYING. BY THE TIME I CONCLUDED THAT USEFUL INFO REGARDING THE 'SPECIAL FLT RULES' COULD NOT BE READILY OBTAINED FROM THE CURRENT WASHINGTON SECTIONAL; OUR TRACK HAD BEGUN TO OVERFLY THE CLASS B AIRSPACE. SINCE I HAD AN UNEASY FEELING AND WAS STILL UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE EXTENT OF THE ADIZ; I ALTERED COURSE TO THE R BY APPROX 35 DEGS TO EXIT THE AIRSPACE OVER THE CLASS B ASAP. THE REMAINDER OF THE FLT WAS UNEVENTFUL. AFTER LNDG; I WAS STILL CONCERNED ABOUT THE EXTENT OF THE 'SPECIAL FLT RULES' AND DID FURTHER RESEARCH OF THE CHARTS. IT WAS ONLY AT THIS POINT THAT I BECAME FULLY AWARE THAT THE ADIZ EXTENDED TO FL180; WHICH; OF COURSE; MEANT THAT I HAD INDEED PENETRATED THIS AIRSPACE BY ABOUT 2 MI. I AM EMBARRASSED TO ADMIT THAT I MADE A SERIOUS MISTAKE BY FAILING TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF RESTR AIRSPACE 'IN ADVANCE' OF FLT. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO GOOD EXCUSE; I OFFER THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS AS CONTRIBUTORY FACTORS: 1) HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE TOO MUCH EXPERIENCE AND FAMILIARITY WITH A RTE CAN BE A DISADVANTAGE. I WAS PROBABLY OVERLY CONFIDENT ABOUT THE INTENDED FLT AND THE EXCELLENT WX WHICH MADE ME SOMEWHAT LESS DILIGENT ABOUT THE ROUTING ASPECTS OF PREFLT PLANNING. 2) PLTS WHO USUALLY FLY IFR CAN BECOME OVERLY DEPENDENT ON ATC TO AVOID RESTR AIRSPACE. 3) OLDER PLTS NEED TO REMIND THEMSELVES FREQUENTLY THAT FLYING VFR IN 2003 IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS 10; 25; OR 40 YRS AGO. OLD KNOWLEDGE CAN BE A PROB: RIVERS; MOUNTAINS AND THE LAWS OF PHYSICS DON'T CHANGE; BUT ARBITRARY AIRSPACE RESTRS CERTAINLY DO. 4) FAILURE TO CLRLY SHOW THE WASHINGTON ADIZ ON THE CURRENT SECTIONAL CHART MAKES IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO RECOVER QUICKLY FROM PREFLT PLANNING OMISSIONS. HAD THE ADIZ PERIMETER BEEN ILLUSTRATED WITH ACCOMPANYING ALTS; I WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE AVOIDED THIS INFRACTION.",,,,"C210 PLT DISCOVERS HE PENETRATED WASHINGTON ADIZ; AT 10500 FT; AFTER HE LANDED.

THEORETICALLY; WE COULD GET NEEDLE MOVEMENT ABOUT WHEN WE REACH 800 FT; BUT WE DO NOT. 4) THE DEP IS NOT ALLOWED FOR RWYS 16L&R BECAUSE TOO MANY PLTS WERE VIOLATING THE RESTR AIRSPACE.

I HAD ESTABLISHED CONTACT WITH POTOMAC TRACON FOR RA'S (FLT FOLLOWING) AND WAS IDENTED AS RADAR CONTACT IN THE VICINITY OF GVE AT 5500 FT MSL DIRECT TO CSN VOR. CONDITIONS WERE VMC WITH A LAYER OF HAZE AT ABOUT 4500 FT MSL; CLR ABOVE WITH UNRESTR VISIBILITIES. SHORTLY AFTER RADAR CONTACT WAS ESTABLISHED; THE TRACON ISSUED AN ADVISORY THAT TFC WAS AT OUR 12 O'CLOCK POS; DSNDING. WE BEGAN TO SCAN THE AREA IN FRONT OF THE ACFT ALONG WITH THE FRONT R SEAT PAX AND THE REAR R SEAT PAX. I SCANNED THE AREA AND COULD NOT IDENT THE TARGET'S LOCATION. JUST AS I WAS BEGINNING TO REFOCUS MY SCAN TO THE 10-11 O'CLOCK POS; THE FRONT SEAT PAX SAID; 'THERE IT IS!' I LOOKED TO MY 1 O'CLOCK HIGH POS; AND A SINGLE ENG LOW WING ACFT; PROBABLY A PIPER ACFT; PASSED JUST ABOVE AND TO MY R OF THE ACFT. THE ACFT HAD COME FROM MY UPPER L QUADRANT MAYBE 10-11 O'CLOCK POS; AND PASSED ABEAM MY 4-5 O'CLOCK POS. THE ACFT WAS; SO CLOSE THAT I COULD EASILY SEE THE REGISTRATION NUMBERS IN WHITE OVER A RED STRIPE. I ESTIMATED THAT I SAW THE ACFT FOR A FRACTION OF A SECOND BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED OVER MY R WING. I IMMEDIATELY RPTED THAT I SAW THE ACFT AND MAY HAVE SAID IT ALMOST HIT ME. NO FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM THE TRACON WAS NOTED. I ROUTINELY FLY ON EITHER AN IFR FLT PLAN OR RECEIVE RA'S WHILE FLYING. UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES; THE TRAINING FLT WAS FOR AERIAL OBSERVERS INVOLVED IN AERIAL SURVEILLANCE OPS WHICH REQUIRED NUMEROUS CHANGES IN DIRECTIONS AND ALTS; HENCE; FLYING ON AN IFR FLT PLAN WAS NOT A VIABLE OPTION. DURING THIS PARTICULAR PHASE OF FLT; THE TRAINING FOR THE OBSERVERS HAD BEEN COMPLETED LONG BEFORE THIS PHASE OF THE FLT COMMENCED. FOLLOWING THE TRAINING; I REQUESTED FLT FOLLOWING AND WAS RECEIVING ADVISORIES. PRIOR TO DSCNT; I COMMENTED THAT THE ONCE CLR WINDSCREEN WAS COVERED WITH A LOT OF DEAD BUGS. I TOLD THE FRONT SEAT PAX THAT THE DEAD BUGS WERE CAUSING PROBS WITH IDENTING TFC BECAUSE MY EYES WERE FOCUSING ON THE BUGS RATHER THAN DISTANT TARGETS. PRIOR TO THE FLT; EACH PAX HAD BEEN BRIEFED ON HOW TO SCAN FOR TFC IN THE ACFT AND THAT THEY WERE TO RPT MY 'PERCEIVED' CONFLICTS TO THE PIC. UP UNTIL THAT POINT; THEY HAD BOTH IDENTED NUMEROUS TARGETS. FOLLOWING THE TA FROM ATC; WE BEGAN SCANNING THE SKY. AFTER I COULD NOT IDENT THE TARGET; I DID NOT NOTIFY ATC THAT I DID NOT HAVE THE TFC IN SIGHT. INSTEAD I CONTINUED TO SCAN AND GAVE DIRECTIONS TO THE PAX TO CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR A DSNDING TARGET AT OUR 12 O'CLOCK POS. ANTICIPATING THAT THE ACFT WAS VERY CLOSE; BASED UPON THE ELAPSED TIME OF THE ADVISORY; 1-2 MINS; I PLACED BOTH HANDS ON THE CTLS AND TOOK THE ACFT OFF AUTOPLT WITH THE ANTICIPATION OF MANEUVERING THE ACFT TO AVOID THE TARGET. WE CONTINUED TO LOOK AND DID NOT HEAR ANY COMS FROM ATC FOR EITHER OUR ACFT OR OTHER ACFT IN THEIR SECTOR. IN RETROSPECT; I SHOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY RPTED THAT I DID NOT HAVE THE TFC IN SIGHT IN THE HOPES THAT ATC WOULD REISSUE THE TARGET'S NEW POS; ISSUE A TFC ALERT OR RECOMMEND A CHANGE IN HEADING OR ALT. ONCE THE PAX YELLED SHE HAD THE ACFT IN SIGHT; I SPOTTED THE PLANE; HOWEVER; I COULD NOT REACT. BY THE TIME I IDENTED THE PLANE; THE PLANE WAS OUT OF SIGHT AND I COULD NOT DIVE OR TURN THE ACFT AWAY FROM THE TARGET. I WAS SURPRISED AT HOW SUDDENLY THE ACFT APPEARED AND WAS EVEN MORE SURPRISED THAT I DID NOT HAVE A QUICK ENOUGH REACTION TIME TO MANEUVER OUR ACFT TO AVOID A POSSIBLE IMPACT EVEN THOUGH I WAS PREPARED TO DO SO. THE COMBINATION OF OUR HIGH WING ACFT AND THE DSNDING ACFT'S LOW-WING CONTRIBUTED TO THE NEAR MIDAIR COLLISION. I PERCEIVED THAT I WAS AT A SAFE ENOUGH ALT NEAR THE GVE VOR BECAUSE I WRONGLY BELIEVED THAT MOST ACFT WOULD START THEIR DSCNTS FURTHER OUT TO LAND AT THE FEW ARPTS IN THE AREA. THE LACK OF ARPTS IN THE AREA GAVE ME THE IMPRESSION THAT GVE WAS MORE ON AN ENRTE NAVAID WHERE ACFT WOULD GENERALLY BE FLYING AT AN ENRTE PHASE RATHER THAN AN APCH PHASE. ALTHOUGH I RECOGNIZED THAT EXTRA VIGILANCE WASREQUIRED NEAR VOR'S; I FELT THAT I WAS AT A SAFE ALT AND FELT REASSURED THAT SINCE I WAS IN RADAR CONTACT I WOULD HAVE HELPED IN IDENTING TARGETS. OUR ACFT IS EQUIPPED WITH A GPS; A SATELLITE WX DOWNLINK AND A MODE S XPONDER. IN THIS INSTANCE; THE TFC INFO SYS (TIS) WAS NOT AVAILABLE SINCE I WAS TOO FAR FROM THE WASHINGTON DC CLASS B AIRSPACE INFRASTRUCTURE. I WAS NOT RELYING ON THE SYS SINCE IT WAS FLAGGED WITH THE TERM 'TFC UNAVAILABLE.' HAD THE 'TIS' SYS BEEN EXPANDED TO OUTLYING AREAS BORDERING THE WASHINGTON CLASS B AIRSPACE; THE 'TIS' SYS WOULD HAVE ALERTED ME TO THE TARGET AND THAT IT WAS NOT ACTUALLY AT MY 12 O'CLOCK POS; BUT WAS INSTEAD AT MY 10-11 O'CLOCK POS; I COULD HAVE MANEUVERED THE ACFT TO BETTER IDENT THE TARGET.",,,,"A HIGH WING SEL ACFT AND A LOW WING DSNDING SEL ACFT PASS WITHIN 100 FT OF EACH OTHER AT 5500 FT EVEN THOUGH ATC TA WAS GIVEN.",

THE OPPORTUNITY HAD FINALLY COME WHEN I JOINED A FLYING CLUB. I REALIZED THAT EVEN THOUGH I HAD ACCUMULATED OVER 14000 HRS TOTAL TIME IN ALL TYPES OF WX; ACFT AND OPS; I KNEW THAT I WOULDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE FLYING THE C-210 UNLESS I WENT UP WITH AN INSTRUCTOR AND RE-FAMILIARIZED MYSELF WITH ITS CHKLIST AND ACFT MANUALS. ON DEC/SAT/03; I GOT AN INSTRUCTOR AND WE WENT UP AND DID SOME LNDGS AND WENT OVER A FEW THINGS. AFTER THE FLT; I FELT COMFORTABLE AND EXCITED ABOUT FLYING THE SMALL ACFT AGAIN. DEC/FRI/03 WAS A CLR; CALM DAY WITH EXCELLENT VISIBILITY. I DID A THOROUGH PREFLT OF THE C-210 INCLUDING REMOVING WHAT LITTLE FROST AND ICE THAT WAS ON THE ACFT. MY PLAN WAS TO JUST HOP AROUND CENTRAL OHIO. I BROUGHT ALONG 2 RELATIVES WHO WANTED TO RIDE ALONG WITH ME. I GOT THE CHKLIST OUT AND ACCOMPLISHED THE BEFORE START; START; AFTER START; TAXI AND BEFORE TKOF CHKLISTS.

I EXTENDED 10 DEGS OF FLAPS; PUSHED THE MIXTURE FULL RICH AND THE THROTTLE FULL FORWARD. TURNING BASE; I PUT IN SOME MORE FLAPS AND TURNING FINAL; FULL FLAPS. I CAN REMEMBER THAT DURING MY CHKOUT; I WAS APCHING AND LNDG A LITTLE FAST; SO MY MAIN FOCUS I BELIEVE WAS ON SPD CTL. ON SHORT FINAL; MY SPD WAS RIGHT ON AND I WAS IN THE SLOT. THE FLARE WAS VERY NICE AND I WAS JUST WAITING FOR A SMOOTH LNDG. HOWEVER; I STARTED HEARING METAL SCRAPING AND BEFORE I KNEW IT; WE WERE SLIDING DOWN THE RWY WITH THE GEAR STILL IN THE 'UP' POS. TO SAY THE LEAST; I WAS STUNNED. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY AWARE OF HOW I OPERATE AN ACFT AND CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE VERY SAFE. I HAVE BEEN FLYING FOR 31 YRS WITHOUT ANY PROB. I HAVE HAD THE VERY BEST TRAINING AND HAVE BEEN A FLT INSTRUCTOR MYSELF. AS I NOW LOOK BACK ON IT; I FEEL THERE WERE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THIS. FOR MANY YRS; I HAVE BEEN IN A SYS THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON CRM; WHICH I BELIEVE IS GREAT. EVEN WITH THAT; I HAVE HAD MY OWN LITTLE BACKUPS INCLUDING ALWAYS CHKING THAT THE FLAPS AND GEAR ARE DOWN AT ABOUT 500 FT AND A FEW OTHER LITTLE ITEMS. HOWEVER; WHEN I WENT TO FLY THE SINGLE ENG; THE MINDSET IS DIFFERENT. ONE; IT'S SINGLE PLT AND THERE IS NO ONE TO BACK YOU UP AND YOU THINK IT IS A 'LITTLE AIRPLANE' AND THAT CHANGES THE MINDSET. I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER IF I EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT PUTTING THE GEAR DOWN. MAYBE I THOUGHT IT WAS ALREADY DOWN. MAYBE I THOUGHT IT WAS A FIXED GEAR. I CAN'T REMEMBER. AS I LOOK BACK; I THINK WHAT I REALLY NEEDED WAS A LOT MORE TOUCH-AND-GOES SO I COULD HAVE NOT ONLY THE GUMP CHKLIST BUT A SET OF ACTIONS. ACTIONS THAT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY REMINDED ME TO DO THINGS IN A SEQUENCE; LIKE FLAPS 10 DEGS; GEAR DOWN. REPETITION IS THE ANSWER. I KNEW WHAT GUMP WAS BUT I THINK I ONLY DID THE 'MP' PART. AS OF NOW; I THINK THAT WHAT I SHOULD DO IS 'GET BACK ON THE HORSE;' BUT THIS IS DEVASTATING TO NOT ONLY ME PERSONALLY BUT PROFESSIONALLY. I HAVE PRIDED MYSELF ON BEING NOT ONLY THE BEST PLT I CAN BE BUT THE SAFEST. I THINK THAT WHEN I GO BACK TO FLYING SINGLE ENG THAT I WILL STAY WITH FIXED GEAR ACFT SO I CAN ENJOY FLYING. IF I EVER DO GO BACK TO COMPLEX SINGLES; I WILL FIRST GET DRILLED IN PROCS. ALSO; I BELIEVE FLT INSTRUCTORS ARE A LITTLE TIMID WHEN IT COMES TO GIVING PLTS LIKE ME THE REAL TRAINING WE NEED AND TO POINT OUT MY FAULTS. THEY SHOULD REALIZE THAT I AM COMING TO THEM AND THAT I NEED THE INSTRUCTION; WHATEVER IT MAY BE.",,,,"C-210 PLT LANDED GEAR UP WHEN HE FORGOT TO LOWER THE GEAR.",

I WAS ADVISED TO AVOID P40 AND THAT EVERYTHING ELSE WAS NORMAL AND THAT NOTHING SPECIAL HAD BEEN ADDED (CHICAGO AREA DID HAVE ADDED RESTRS). I TOLD FSS I WOULD BE GOING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WASHINGTON; DC; AREA. ON DEC/THU/03 AT APPROX XB30; I DEPARTED VFR AT AN ARPT IN BUCKINGHAM; VA; TOWARDS THE PXT VORTAC AT 3000 FT MSL. I WAS INTENDING TO PROCEED TO BRANDYWINE ARPT; PA (N99) BY AVOIDING THE METROPOLITAN DC AREA (ADIZ AND CLASS B) TO THE S TO PXT AND THEN N AND E OF THE AREA TO MY DEST. THE WX WAS CAVU. WHEN N OF FLATROCK VOR (FAK); I TRIED TO REACH THE PXT APCH ON 120.05 WITH NO RESPONSE. I THEN CONTACTED POTOMAC APCH (THE OLD RICHMOND APCH) AND ASKED IF THE RESTR AREAS R-6611; R-6612 AND R-6613 WERE HOT OR COLD. POTOMAC APCH REPLIED OVER SEVERAL XMISSIONS THAT THEY WERE COLD AND I WOULD HAVE TO CALL PXT APCH AT 120.05 FOR INFO ON OTHER RESTR AREAS CLOSE TO NHK ARPT (R-4005; R-4006; R-4007; ETC). I TOLD POTOMAC APCH I HAD ALREADY TRIED PXT WITH NO RESPONSE. POTOMAC APCH SAID I WAS A LITTLE TOO FAR OUT AND TO TRY AGAIN IN 10 MI. IN ABOUT 10 MI AT APPROX XC30; I CALLED PXT APCH AGAIN SEVERAL TIMES. I FINALLY RECEIVED A REPLY FROM PXT APCH WHICH STATED 'PLEASE BE ADVISED WE ARE CLOSED FOR TODAY.' AT THAT TIME; I THOUGHT IT WAS ODD THAT POTOMAC APCH DID NOT KNOW THAT PXT WAS CLOSED. I IMMEDIATELY REFERRED TO THE WASHINGTON/BALTIMORE TAC FOR A NEARBY POTOMAC APCH FREQ. THE WASHINGTON SECTIONAL #74 AND THE VFR TAC BALTIMORE-WASHINGTON #67 BOTH INDICATED THAT PXT APCH (120.05) IS THE FREQ TO USE IN THIS AREA. AT THIS TIME; I WAS APCHING DAHLGREN; VA (R-6612). I CALLED POTOMAC APCH AND THEY GAVE ME A SQUAWK FOR FLT FOLLOWING AND CLASS B AREA. SOMETIME LATER; POTOMAC TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD BEEN NOTIFIED THAT I HAD PENETRATED THE ADIZ SQUAWKING 1200 AND GAVE ME A PHONE NUMBER TO CALL AS SOON AS I LANDED. WHEN I LANDED AT N99 WESTCHESTER COUNTY; PA; THEY TOOK ALL MY PERTINENT PLT INFO. I TOLD THEM THE INFO AS RPTED ABOVE AND THE SUPVR IN CHARGE SAID HE WOULD GET THE TAPE OF THE POTOMAC APCH (RICHMOND AREA) TO VERIFY MY XMISSIONS; AND IN PASSING STATED THAT 'YES; QUANTICO AND DAHLGREN AIR FACILITIES HAD SHUT DOWN FOR THE DAY' AND I WOULD HEAR FROM THE FSDO LATER. DURING THE ENTIRE FLT EARLY MORNING; THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FLYING ACTIVITY AND EVIDENTLY LOW FAA MANNING LEVEL. I HAVE NEVER IN MY 40 YRS OF FLYING FOUND AN APCH CTL SHUT DOWN FOR THE DAY.

AFTER ASKING FOR A PROGRESSIVE TAXI CLRNC; I HELD SHORT AT THE ASSIGNED INTXN AND CHANGED TO TWR FREQ. I WAS ASKED BY TWR TO CONFIRM THAT THE REMAINING RWY FROM THE INTXN WAS SUFFICIENT. I SHIFTED MY ATTN TO THE 'SHORTER' END OF THE RWY; CONFIRMED IT WAS SUFFICIENT; AND WAS CLRED TO THE LCL EQUIVALENT OF 'POS AND HOLD.' ON TURNING ONTO THE RWY; I CONFIRMED THE DIRECTION OF TURN TOWARDS THE ASSIGNED RWY ON THE DIRECTIONAL GYRO AND HELD IN POS TO AWAIT TKOF CLRNC. AFTER A SHORT PERIOD; WAS CLRED FOR TKOF. ON CLBOUT; I WAS ADVISED BY THE TWR I HAD DEPARTED ON RWY 24L RATHER THAN RWY 6R AND WAS TOLD TO TURN TO A SPECIFIC HDG. I IMMEDIATELY BEGAN A STEEP TURN TO THE ASSIGNED HDG. ABOUT 1/2 WAY THROUGH THE TURN; THE CLRNC WAS REPEATED; IN SUCH A WAY THAT I ASSUMED I WAS TURNING TO THE HDG IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. IN MY READBACK; I CONFIRMED THE NEW DIRECTION OF TURN TO THE ASSIGNED HDG. SOON THE CTLR; SOUNDING MORE CONCERNED; ASSIGNED A NEW HDG. I IMMEDIATELY TURNED TO THAT HDG AND WAS FLYING IT WHEN THE CTLR REPEATED THE ASSIGNMENT. I CONFIRMED THAT I WAS FLYING THE ASSIGNED HDG. AT THIS POINT; THE CTLR ADVISED A DC9 ON APCH TO RWY 6L THAT A LIGHT ACFT WAS NOT LISTENING TO DIRECTIONS. SIMULTANEOUSLY; I RECOGNIZED I MUST NOT ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN FLYING THE ASSIGNED HDG I THOUGHT I WAS FLYING. I DETERMINED THAT THE DIRECTIONAL GYRO WAS INCORRECTLY SET; RESET THE DIRECTIONAL GYRO AND TURNED TO THE ACTUAL ASSIGNED HDG. THE CAPT OF THE DC9 REPLIED TO THE CTLR THAT MY ACFT WAS IN SIGHT AND ADVISED THE CTLR THAT I WAS TURNING AWAY HIS FLT PATH AND WOULD NOT BE A FACTOR. I ADVISED THE CTLR I WAS NOW ON THE CORRECT HDG. ON LEAVING HIS AIRSPACE; HE REQUESTED I CALL HIM. THE REMAINDER OF THE FLT WAS UNEVENTFUL. ON CALLING HIM; I EXPLAINED MY LACK OF DIRECTIONAL CTL WAS DUE TO AN INCORRECTLY SET DIRECTIONAL GYRO AND THAT ON DIAGNOSING AND CORRECTING THAT PROB I WAS ABLE TO FOLLOW HIS INSTRUCTIONS. THE PRIMARY FACTORS INVOLVED IN THIS INCIDENT RELATED TO: 1) STRESS RELATED TO OPERATING AT AN UNFAMILIAR AIRFIELD; INTERPING A NEW CLRNC FROM THAT FIELD. 2) FAILURE TO CORRECTLY SET THE DIRECTIONAL GYRO (IN SPITE OF FOLLOWING A PRINTED CHKLIST). 3) FATIGUE. 4) LACK OF INDEPENDENT CORROBORATION OR XCHKING OF DATA. A) UNFAMILIAR WITH FIELD -- PROGRESSIVE TAXI; NO CUES FROM OTHER ACFT REGARDING DIRECTION OF RWY TO USE; HELD SHORT AT AN INTXN FOR DEP. B) DISCUSSION OF ADEQUACY OF REMAINING RWY AT INTXN -- SHIFTED MENTAL FOCUS TO SHORT END. C) OVERLAPPING ERROR WITH DIRECTIONAL GYRO SETTING CONFOUNDED DIRECTIONAL CHK ON TURNING ONTO RWY. D) FAILURE TO CORROBORATE WITH AVAILABLE AIDS IN ACFT -- ARPT DIAGRAM ON MOVING MAP DISPLAY. 5) FAILURE TO HEED 'INNER VOICE' THAT RECOGNIZED SOMETHING WAS NOT RIGHT AS TKOF ROLL BEGAN. 6) THE CALM PROFESSIONALISM OF THE CTLR -- DIRECTLY AND SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTED POSITIVELY TO THE 'CONTAINMENT' OF THIS INCIDENT. HE ISSUED INSTRUCTIONS IN A MANNER; WHICH DID NOT COMPOUND THE STRESS INHERENT IN DEALING WITH WHAT WAS CLRLY A MAJOR ERROR. OPERATIONAL SUGGESTION: IN CASES WHERE A CTLR DETERMINES AN ACFT IS NOT UNDER DIRECTIONAL CTL (EG; FAILING TO FLY AN ASSIGNED HDG ONCE; OR EVEN BASED SOLELY ON DEP ON AN UNASSIGNED RWY) AND POTENTIAL FOR CONFLICT WITH OTHER ACFT EXISTS; IT MAY MAKE MORE SENSE TO GIVE A SPECIFIC TURN INSTRUCTION; RATHER THAN A HDG. FOR EXAMPLE; ON DEP ON A WRONG RWY; AN INSTRUCTION TO TURN 90 DEGS L MAY SAVE VALUABLE SECONDS. THIS WOULD HELP COVER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE INITIAL ERROR MAY EXTEND BEYOND PLT STUPIDITY AND INCLUDE A FUNCTIONAL DEFICIENCY IN THE ACFT SET-UP.",,,,"CLRED FOR TKOF FROM AN INTXN AT CYUL; C210 PLT TAKES OFF ON RWY 24L VICE RWY 6R.

PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE SPD ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DSCNT; FLAPS WERE DEPLOYED ONLY TO (LESS THAN) 10 DEGS PRIOR TO XING THE FAF AND WERE NOT SUBSEQUENTLY DEPLOYED FURTHER. DURING THE DSCNT ON APCH; A LOW ALT ALERT WAS ISSUED BY THE TWR INCLUDING THE CURRENT ALTIMETER SETTING. I CHKED THE SETTING AND MY ALT; WHICH WAS ABOVE THE APPROPRIATE MDA; AND PROCEEDED WITH THE APCH. CLOUD BASES WERE VARIABLE AND I WAS IN AND OUT OF CLOUD WHICH IMPACTED FORWARD VISIBILITY; THOUGH I HAD CLR GND CONTACT FROM BEFORE THE FINAL DME BASED STEPDOWN. AFTER FINALLY BREAKING OUT AND MAKING VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE RWY; IT WAS CLR THAT MY SPD WAS STILL HIGHER THAN USUAL AND I ELECTED TO PERFORM AN S-TURN TO SLOW DOWN. IT WAS ONLY AFTER LNDG AND BEING ASKED BY THE TWR CTLR ABOUT CLOUD BASES AND WHY I HAD PERFORMED AN S-TURN ON FINAL APCH THAT I REALIZED THAT I HAD NOT LOWERED THE FLAPS TO THE NORMAL LNDG POS. THE NONSTANDARD DSNDING TURN CLOSE TO THE FAF MEANT THAT THE ACFT WAS FLYING FASTER THAN USUAL. THE HIGH WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH INTERCEPTING THE VOR TRACK AND BEGINNING FINAL DSCNT IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE; AT SPDS HIGHER THAN I COULD DEPLOY THE FLAPS; RESULTED IN BEGINNING THE FINAL APCH DSCNT IN WHAT FOR ME IS A NONSTANDARD CONFIGN. THIS NONSTANDARD CONFIGN RESULTED IN A FINAL VISUAL APCH THAT DID NOT 'FEEL RIGHT;' BECAUSE THE PLANE WAS NOT SLOWLY NORMALLY OR DSNDING WITH THE NORMAL NOSE ATTITUDE. I ELECTED TO PERFORM AN S-TURN TO SLOW THE PLANE AS I DID NOT THINK TO CHK THE FLAP POS ON SHORT FINAL. THE LOW ALT ALERT WAS AN ADDITIONAL STRESS FACTOR DURING THE APCH; PARTICULARLY FOLLOWING THE HIGH RATES OF DSCNT DURING THE INITIAL PART OF THE APCH. HOWEVER; MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT RATE OF DSCNT IS PART OF THE ALGORITHM WHICH TRIGGERS THE ALERT AND I CONFIRMED ON CHKING MY ALT THAT I WAS ABOVE PRESCRIBED MINIMUMS. WHILE FLYING THIS APCH PREVIOUSLY; I HAD BEEN ISSUED WITH SUCH AN ALERT WHILE WITHIN ALT LIMITS AND HAD OFTEN HEARD OTHER ACFT TRIGGER THE WARNING AND SO IT WAS NOT AS STRESSING AS IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME IN AS MANY MONTHS THAT RELATIVELY ACUTE AND STEEP TURNS CLOSE TO FAF OR OM HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO DIFFICULT APCHS FOR ME. THEY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO 'STAY AHEAD' OF THE ACFT AND REDUCE ONE'S ABILITY TO COPE WITH SUBSEQUENT ISSUES IN THE APCH.

WE FLEW IN ANOTHER ACFT AND INTERCEPTED HIM TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE ACFT FROM THE AIR. WE SAW THAT THE NOSE GEAR DOOR WAS SLIGHTLY OPEN BY ABOUT 2-3 INCHES. HE THEN ATTEMPTED MORE FLT MANEUVERS TO FREE THE GEAR AND ANOTHER ATTEMPT AT TOUCHING DOWN ON THE RWY. THIS WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. HE WAS NOW LOW ON FUEL AND FROM THE ACFT CHKLIST PERFORMED A NOSE GEAR UP LNDG. THE ENG WAS SHUT DOWN ON TOUCHDOWN AND THE ACFT ROTATED DOWN ONTO THE RWY AND CAME TO A STOP. THE PLT EXITED THE ACFT WITH NO INJURY. WE RAISED THE ACFT NOSE UP AND FREED THE GEAR AND EXTENDED IT TO A DOWN AND LOCKED POS. AFTER GETTING THE ACFT BACK INTO THE HANGAR; WE LOOKED FOR THE PROB. THE SIDE TURBO ACCESS PANEL HAD BEEN REMOVED DURING THE INSPECTION. IT WAS NOTED THAT ALL OF THE SCREWS SECURING THIS PANEL ALONG THE SIDE OF THE NOSE GEAR WHEEL WELL WERE MISSING. WE FEEL THAT THE PROB WAS THAT DURING THE FINAL INSPECTION OF THE ACFT; THESE SCREWS WERE MISSED TO SEE IF THEY WERE ACTUALLY INSTALLED AT ALL OR INSTALLED AND TIGHT. WE FEEL THESE SCREWS WERE MISSED DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE SCREWS ARE UNDER THE NOSE GEAR DOOR WHEN THE GEAR IS DOWN IN ITS NORMAL CONDITION. VISIBILITY IS LIMITED; SO DUE TO A LACK OF VISIBILITY THEY DID NOT GET NOTICED DURING THIS FINAL INSPECTION THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE A PROB WITH INTERFERENCE WITH THE GEAR NOT EXTENDING. TO CORRECT THIS PROB WE ARE GOING TO START USING A WORKSHEET CHKLIST FOR PANELS REMOVED AND INSTALLED WITH DUAL INSPECTIONS. WE HAVE ALSO SHUT DOWN THIS SHOP FOR THE TIME BEING. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR STATED THE ACFT DAMAGE WAS LIMITED TO THE PROP; NOSE GEAR DOORS AND SURROUNDING SKIN.

THERE WERE THREE PLANES IN THE PATTERN USING RWY 24 AND I ANNOUNCED THAT I WAS S OF THE FIELD AND WOULD BE ENTERING A 45 L DOWNWIND FOR RWY 24. A 172 ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE L CROSSWIND FOR RWY 24 AND NUMBER 3 TO LAND. I ACQUIRED THAT PLANE VISUALLY AND ANNOUNCED THAT I HAD THEM IN SIGHT AND WOULD FOLLOW AS NUMBER 4. ALL RADIO COMS WERE SUFFERING FROM OVER-TALK AS THERE ARE 3 ARPTS IN THE GENERAL AREA USING THE SAME UNICOM FREQ. JUST BEFORE TURNING DOWNWIND; I SAW A SECOND 172 TRAILING THE ONE I HAD ALREADY SEEN. I ANNOUNCED THAT I SAW THE SECOND 172 AND THAT I WOULD DO A R 360 DEG ON THE 45 AND FOLLOW THAT ACFT AS NUMBER 5. THE FIRST 172 LANDED AND PULLED OFF AT THE SECOND TXWY AND THE 172 IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF MY ACFT TOUCHED DOWN AROUND THE NUMBERS WHILE I WAS ON ABOUT 3/4 MILE FINAL. THE FIRST 172 STOPPED AT THE TXWY INTXN AND THE SECOND 172 APPEARED TO SLOW THEIR TAXI WAITING FOR THE PRECEDING PLANE TO CLEAR THE TXWY. AS I APCHED A SHORT FINAL; THE FIRST 172 RESUMED TAXIING AND THE SECOND 172 CONTINUED TO TAXI TOWARDS THE SECOND TXWY EXIT WHICH IS ABOUT 1800 FT DOWN THE RWY. AT THAT POINT I ELECTED TO TOUCHDOWN RATHER THAN EXECUTE A MISSED APCH AS I FELT CERTAIN OF A) MY ABILITY TO STOP IF NECESSARY OR B) MY ABILITY TO GO AROUND THE 172 ON THE GRASS IF NECESSARY. I BASED MY DECISION ON THE NUMBER OF PLANES IN THE PATTERN AND MY LACK OF AWARENESS OF THEIR SPECIFIC LOCATION AND ON THE JAMMED RADIO FREQ WHICH MIGHT PREVENT OTHER PLANES FROM HEARING A MISSED APCH ANNOUNCEMENT. THE OTHER 172 CONTINUED AND EXITED THE RAMP; BUT BOTH PLANES WERE SIMULTANEOUSLY ON THE RWY FOR ABOUT 10 SECONDS. THE CLOSEST APCH OF THE TWO ACFT WAS APPROX 1000 FT. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: I COULD HAVE FLOWN A LONGER DOWNWIND TO AVOID ANY POTENTIAL LNDG DELAYS; MY REASON FOR NOT DOING SO WAS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE WAS AN ACFT BEHIND ME WHICH I HAD NOT IDENTIFIED AND WHICH MAY NOT HAVE HEARD MY CALL. AN EXTENDED DOWNWIND COULD HAVE RESULTED IN BOTH PLANES TURNING FINAL AT THE SAME TIME. A MAJOR CONTRIBUTING FACTOR WAS THE AMOUNT OF PLANES TRYING TO USE THE FREQ FROM 3 DIFFERENT ARPTS RESULTING IN RADIO BLOCKAGE AND CONFUSION AS PLTS ONLY HEARD PARTIAL CALLS AND MISTOOK THE ARPT BEING REFERENCED. ADDITIONAL UNICOM FREQS AND LIMITING THE NUMBER OF ARPTS ON THE SAME FREQ WITHIN GEOGRAPHICAL PROXIMITY WOULD HELP DEAL WITH THE COM ISSUES. CONTINUED PLT TRAINING ON CONCISE BUT BRIEF RPTING WOULD ALSO HELP WITH THE PROB. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR POINTED OUT THERE ARE FIVE ARPTS IN THE VICINITY JUST TO THE N OF PHL WHO SHARE THE SAME CTAF/UNICOM FREQ: N31; N67; N70; N99 AND N87.

THE AIRPLANE WAS AT FULL GROSS WT; AND THE TKOF ELEVATION WAS 6400 FT. THE TURBO HANDLED TKOF AND INITIAL CLB WITH NO PROBS. MY PREFLT WX BRIEFING INDICATED THAT WE'D BE FLYING THROUGH 2 COLD FRONTS; ONE OF WHICH WAS JUST PASSING THROUGH JACKSON. WX WAS 6000 FT OVCST WITH THE USUAL AIRMET FOR ICING AND RPTS OF LIGHT RIME ICING IN THE CLOUDS. WE WERE ASSIGNED THE TETON 2 DEP DIRECT KICNE INTXN; DIRECT POCATELLO VOR. THAT DEP REQUIRES A CLB TO 14000 FT TO CLR THE MOUNTAINS. THE MOCA IS 10000 FT ALONG THAT RTE; WHICH WILL BECOME IMPORTANT LATER IN THIS STORY. WE ENTERED THE CLOUDS AT 12000 FT MSL AND DID NOT PICK UP ICE IMMEDIATELY. HOWEVER; WHEN WE REACHED KICNE INTXN AND TURNED W TOWARDS POCATELLO; WE BEGAN PICKING UP LIGHT RIME ICE. THAT DIDN'T BOTHER ME AT FIRST; BECAUSE IT WAS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT HAD BEEN FORECAST AND RPTED. HOWEVER; THE ICING QUICKLY BECOME MODERATE IN INTENSITY AS WE CLBED THROUGH 13000 FT. OUTSIDE AIR TEMP WAS ABOUT -4 DEGS C. MY AIRPLANE HAS THE FACTORY-INSTALLED 'FULL DEICE' SYS; WHICH INCLUDES PITOT HEAT; ELECTRIC PROP DEICE; BOOTS ON THE LEADING EDGES OF THE WINGS AND HORIZ STABILIZER; AND A REMOVABLE; HALF-HT WINDSCREEN HOT PLATE. INITIALLY; THE BOOTS DID A GOOD JOB OF CRACKING THE ICE OFF THE WINGS AND STABILIZER. HOWEVER; I NOTICED THAT THE BOOTS DIDN'T REMOVE ALL THE ICE; AND IT WAS QUICKLY BUILDING ON UNPROTECTED SURFACES. BY THE TIME WE CLBED TO 14000 FT; THE AIRSPD HAD BEGUN TO DECAY DUE TO ICE ACCUMULATION ON THE AIRFRAME. AT THIS POINT; POCATELLO WAS ABOUT 60 NM AHEAD AND I KNEW THAT THE WORST ICING WOULD BE OVER THE MOUNTAINS ENRTE. ONCE WE GOT WITHIN 10 NM OF POCATELLO; WE'D BE OVER THE SNAKE RIVER PLAIN AND ICING WAS UNLIKELY TO BE A PROB. SO; I DECIDED TO PRESS AHEAD RATHER THAN RETURN TO JACKSON. AS THE AIRSPD CONTINUED TO DECAY; THE AUTOPLT PITCHED THE AIRPLANE UP TO A HIGHER AND HIGHER ANGLE OF ATTACK. I KNEW THIS WASN'T GOOD; SINCE IT EXPOSED THE UNPROTECTED LOWER SURFACES OF THE AIRFRAME TO ICING. FINALLY; AT ABOUT 85 KIAS; THE AIRPLANE BEGAN TO BUFFET. IT SEEMED TO BE COMING FROM THE TAIL; AND I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT 'TAIL STALL!' I DISENGAGED THE AUTOPLT AND PITCHED THE NOSE DOWN TO PREVENT A STALL. I CALLED ZLC; DECLARED AN EMER; AND TOLD THEM I COULD NOT MAINTAIN ALT AND WAS DSNDING TO ESCAPE MODERATE ICING CONDITIONS. THEY CLRED ME DOWN TO 12000 FT IMMEDIATELY AND TO 10000 FT WITHIN 50 MI E OF POCATELLO. THE AIRPLANE PICKED UP SPD AND BY USING THE BOOTS PERIODICALLY; I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN 13000 FT. SURE ENOUGH; WE FLEW OUT OF THE WORST ICING ONCE WE GOT CLR OF THE MOUNTAINS. AFTER THAT; THE CLOUDS THINNED OUT AND I WAS LEFT TO CONTEMPLATE THE FROZEN SCENERY ARRAYED ON MY AIRFRAME AS IT SLOWLY SUBLIMATED AWAY.

I CONTINUED MY DSCNT ON COURSE AND AS I WAS ABEAM THE WESTERN PARALLEL RWY AT TRAVIS THE CTLR ADVISED ME THAT THEY HAD A FLT OF 2 TANKERS ABOUT TO DEPART FROM THE PARALLEL RWYS. HE TOLD ME TO STOP MY DSCNT AT OR ABOVE 3000 FT. I STOPPED MY DSCNT AT 3100 FT AND LEVELED OFF ON THE SAME COURSE. THE CTLR SAID HE WOULD VECTOR ME OVER THE DEP END OF THE ARPT IN ORDER TO GET ME OUT OF THE WAY OF THE DEPARTING TANKERS. HE INSTRUCTED ME TO TURN TO 120 DEGS AND I REPEATED BACK THAT I WAS TURNING TO 120 DEGS; A HDG THAT WAS NOW S OF THE DEP END OF THE W PARALLEL RWY AND MI S OF THE E PARALLEL RWY; WHICH IS MUCH FARTHER N THAN THE W RWY. THE FIRST TANKER LIFTED OFF THE W PARALLEL RWY AND WAS CLBING WHEN I FIRST SAW HIM. HE WAS APPROX 800-1000 FT BELOW ME AS I CROSSED OVER HIS PATH. THE SECOND TANKER; WITH WHICH I HAD NO VISUAL CONTACT; WAS FARTHER TO THE E AND FARTHER N AS HE WAS CLBING. I FIRST SAW HIM AS I APCHED THE DEP END OF THE EASTERN RWY AND HE WAS ALREADY APPROX 600 FT BELOW ME. HE WAS 300-400 FT BELOW ME WHEN I CROSSED HIS COURSE. I WAS STILL ON THE GIVEN VECTOR OF 120 DEGS AND MAINTAINING 3100 FT AT THE TIME OF XING PATHS. A CREW MEMBER FROM THE TANKER IN QUESTION SAW ME; STATED HE WANTED TO RPT THE INCIDENT AND BELIEVED I WAS AT FAULT. I IMMEDIATELY ANNOUNCED THAT I WAS VECTORED INTO THE SIT BY THE CTLR. AT THIS POINT THE CTLR SAID; 'NO I DIDN'T; RESUME YOUR OWN NAV.' I REPLIED; 'YES YOU DID; YOU BETTER REVIEW YOUR TAPES.' I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THE TANKER CREW WAS ABLE TO HEAR THIS DIALOGUE OR NOT. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ACTIONS THAT COULD HAVE AVOIDED THIS SIT: 1) THERE COULD HAVE BEEN AN ALT RESTR ON THE TANKER'S CLB; 2) I COULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN A DIFFERENT VECTOR; 3) I COULD HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO MAKE A R 360 DEG TURN TO AVOID TFC. I REALIZE THE TRAVIS FACILITY IS A TRAINING FACILITY FOR MIL AIR TFC CTLRS. I BELIEVE THIS CTLR SHOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER CLOSER SUPERVISION IN ORDER TO AVOID SUCH SITS.

I LOOKED AT THE WX CONDITIONS BEFORE DEP FROM A HOME COMPUTER. I NEGLECTED TO CALL FSS FOR A WX RPT FOR THE RTE OF FLT. I DID CALL A FRIEND WHO IS A PLT AT TRUCKEE (THE DEST ARPT) AND HE INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS A HOLE OVER TRUCKEE BUT IF I COULD NOT GET IN THAT HE WOULD DRIVE DOWN TO AUBURN; CA (AUN) AND PICK ME UP. CONTRIBUTING FACTOR #1: INSUFFICIENT WX INFO AND POOR PREFLT PLANNING. I HAVE ON BOARD REAL TIME WX AND DURING THE FLT I NOTICE THE WX DETERIORATION ALONG THE RTE OF FLT. MY ALTERNATIVE ARPT (AUN) WAS NOT VFR. I CALLED FROM MY CELL PHONE AND TOLD MY FRIEND NOT TO PICK US UP AND THAT WE WOULD LAND IN AT SAC ARPT AND RENT A CAR. AT THIS POINT I MADE A DECISION TO GO UNDER THE CLOUD LAYER AND TRY TO GET IN AT SAC RATHER THAN GO 'ON TOP' AND TRY TO GO TO TRK OR RNO. THIS TURNED OUT TO BE CONTRIBUTING FACTOR #2: GOING UNDER THE WX; I RAN OUT OF VFR AND INTO IFR CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH I AM IFR RATED; I HAD NOT FLOWN IFR IN SOME TIME; AND ALTHOUGH I AM TECHNICALLY COMPLIANT; I WAS CERTAINLY NOT CONFIDENT AND HAVE MUCH HIGHER PERSONAL MINIMUMS THAN WAS PRESENT ON THIS DAY. APCHING SAC; I WAS ALMOST OUT OF VFR AND I CALLED APCH AND ASKED TO FILE IFR INTO SAC ARPT. THEY ACCEPTED MY REQUEST. ALTHOUGH I HAD GOOD SITUATIONAL AWARENESS; I DID NOT REALIZE THE STRENGTH OF THE XWIND ON FINAL APCH AND I WAS BLOWN OFF THE ILS. THE APCH CTL TOLD ME TO GO MISSED AND TRY AGAIN. I WAS VECTORED FOR ANOTHER APCH. I WAS AT 3000 FT AGL; ON MY SECOND APCH I PUT MY GEAR DOWN TOO SOON. I WAS GOING SLOW AND HIT SOME MODERATE TURB. AS I TRACKED THE ILS I NOTICED A DRASTIC LOSS OF AIRSPD FOLLOWED BY A LOSS OF ALT AND A STEEP (30 DEG BANK TO THE L). I BELIEVE THAT I GOT TOO SLOW AND HIT TURB THAT MADE THE PLANE STEEPLY BANK. I WAS CLOSE TO AN UNUSUAL ATTITUDE. I RECOVERED AND CALLED FOR HELP TO THE APCH CTL. APCH CTL TOLD ME TO FLY THE AIRPLANE AND REGAIN CTL. I SCARED MYSELF; BUT RECOVERED. CONTRIBUTING FACTOR #3: I SHOULD HAVE TERMINATED ALL APCHS AND ASKED FOR VECTORS TO A NEARBY VFR ARPT. APCH CTL WAS INCREDIBLY PROFESSIONAL; NON JUDGEMENTAL AND HELPFUL. THEY SUGGESTED I FLY TO SMF ARPT BECAUSE THE CEILING WAS HIGHER. THEY TOLD ME THAT THE CEILING WAS 659 FT AGL. THIS IS BELOW MY PERSONAL MINIMUM AND I SHOULD HAVE LEFT THE AREA. AGAIN; I HAD TROUBLE GETTING IN ON THE FIRST ATTEMPT. I DID NOT HOLD THE ILS; BECAUSE OF MODERATE TURB AND A LARGE XWIND. I WENT MISSED AND I ASKED FOR ANOTHER TRY. ATC SUGGEST I GO TO A VFR ARPT. BUT I WANTED TO TRY AGAIN. I MADE A SUCCESSFUL LNDG ON THE NEXT ATTEMPT ALTHOUGH I WAS STILL SEVERAL HUNDRED FT OFF THE CTRLINE OF THE RWY WHEN I BROKE THROUGH THE CLOUDS. CONTRIBUTING FACTOR #4: CONTINUING TO TRY THE APCH WHEN I WAS ALREADY FLUSTERED AND FRUSTRATED. I SHOULD HAVE LEFT THE AREA AND FLOWN TO A VFR ARPT. HUMAN PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATION: MY JUDGEMENT ON THIS DAY WAS POOR. I KEPT ON TELLING MYSELF THAT BECAUSE I WAS IFR TRAINED AND CURRENT; THAT I MUST BE ABLE TO DO IT. IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME EVEN AFTER I ALMOST LOST CTL OF THE AIRPLANE THAT THE CONDITIONS PRESENT WERE ABOVE MY ABILITY. I HAVE HUMBLED MYSELF SINCE THEN. I MADE MANY MISTAKES THAT DAY. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE INFORMED ON THE WX. I SHOULD NOT HAVE FILED IFR BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS WERE ABOVE MY ABILITY. I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO ATC WHEN THEY SUGGESTED I MIGHT TRY A VFR ARPT. I SHOULD HAVE ASKED TO AND FLOWN TO A VFR ARPT. I CAN HARDLY EXPLAIN MY THINKING AT THE TIME. I JUST FELT THAT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT BECAUSE OF MY TRAINING; SO I KEPT ATTEMPTING EVEN THOUGH I WAS HAVING PROBS. FORTUNATELY; I LANDED FINE AND ONLY BRUISED MY PRIDE. THE STEPS I HAVE TAKEN TO CORRECT MY MISTAKES ARE AS FOLLOWS: I IMMEDIATELY GNDED MYSELF FROM ALL IFR FLT. I SIGNED UP FOR AND ATTENDED CESSNA 210 PROFICIENCY COURSE. I HAVE FLOWN WITH INSTRUCTORS TWICE SINCE THIS INSTANCE. I AM STILL IN THE PROCESS OF COMPLETELY RETRAINING MYSELF ON IFR FLYING.

MR X IS THE OBJECT OF AN FAA WITCH HUNT WHICH RESULTED IN HE HAVING TO COMPLETE A CHK RIDE WITH AN FAA FLT PLT EXAMINER. THE EXAMINER TOLD HIM THAT IN ADDITION TO THE EXAMINERS; AN FAA AIRWORTHINESS WOULD INSPECT HIS AIRPLANE; LOGBOOKS AND FILES. THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT IF AN EXPERT WANTS TO; HE CAN FIND SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE AIRPLANE; LOGBOOKS OR PAPERWORK; NO MATTER HOW MINOR. THIS WOULD INCLUDE MY ENTRIES. IN VIEW OF THE PROBS MR X IS HAVING WITH THE LCL FSDO; I COULD HAVE REFUSED TO BE OF SVC TO HIM; THUS RELIEVING MYSELF OF POSSIBLE SCRUTINY AND EXPOSURE. BUT INSTEAD OF PASSING THE PROB OFF TO OTHERS AND BEING A MAN OF HIGH INTEGRITY; I SPENT OVER 2 WKS GOING OVER THE AIRPLANE; COMPLETELY REVISING THE AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES AND PAINSTAKINGLY COMPLETING THE LOGBOOK ENTRIES. BUT LIKE I SAID; I CAN BE SURE THAT IF THE WRONG AIRWORTHINESS INSPECTOR IS ON THE SCENE HE CAN ALWAYS FIND SOME DISCREPANCY; NO MATTER HOW MINOR. I SAY THAT BECAUSE (BASED ON) OF MY 57 YRS IN THE BUSINESS. I HAVE EVEN OBSERVED FAA REPRESENTATIVES DISAGREEING WITH EACH OTHER ON THINGS LIKE THE INTERP OF THE REGS AND OTHER MINOR MATTERS OF ADMINISTRATIVE POSITION. HAVING SAID ALL THAT; I CAN STATE WITH UTMOST CERTAINTY THAT IF AN ERROR IN MY WORK IS UNCOVERED IT WILL BE THE RESULT OF AN INADVERTENT AND UNINTENTIONAL ERROR; AND NOT NEGLIGENCE. IT IS FOR THE ABOVE REASONS THAT I AM COMPLETING THIS NASA RPT. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR STATED THE OWNER OF THE AIRPLANE FAILED AN INST CHK RIDE DUE TO NOT HAVING THE PROPER APCH PLATE. THE FAA INSPECTOR ALSO TOLD THE OWNER THAT AT THE NEXT CHK RIDE THE AIRPLANE WILL BE INSPECTED BY 2 FAA SAFETY INSPECTORS BEFORE FLT. THE 2 INSPECTORS WILL MAKE AN INSPECTION OF THE AIRPLANE; INCLUDING LOGBOOKS AND FILES. THE RPTR IS CONCERNED THAT DUE TO WHAT HE FEELS IS A PREJUDICIAL ATTITUDE OF THE INSPECTORS; THEY WILL ABSOLUTELY FIND SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE AIRPLANE; LOGBOOKS OR FILES.

AS I APCHED THE MALIBU CANYON AREA MY TIS SHOWED AN ACFT AT A SLIGHTLY LOWER ALT AND AHEAD GOING SBOUND (FROM MY L TO MY R). I VISUALLY DETECTED THE ACFT (A PIPER CHEROKEE) AS IT TURNED EBOUND AT APPROX MY 1 O'CLOCK POS AND 1 MI OR SO. IT WAS WELL DEFINED AGAINST THE OCEAN. I WAS OVERTAKING IT AND PLANNED TO PASS IT TO ITS L. THERE WAS ADEQUATE TERRAIN CLRNC TO DO SO; EVEN IN DSCNT. SHORTLY AFTER I SAW THIS ACFT; THE CTLR CALLED IT AND ANOTHER ACFT. I NEVER SAW THIS SECOND ACFT; BUT IT PASSED US. A FEW MOMENTS LATER; MY TIS SUDDENLY DISPLAYED ANOTHER ACFT AT MY ALT AHEAD AND COMING TOWARD ME AND THE CHEROKEE.

YELLOW RETURNS WERE MILD TURB ON THIS LEG. AFTER PICK UP OF PATIENT WE HAD TO RETURN THROUGH THE FRONT TO DROP OFF THE PATIENT IN PITTSBURGH. WE WERE ABLE TO AVOID STORM CELL BY FLYING N OF COURSE (STORM CELL TRAVELING NE) AND WAS IN AN OPEN AREA AND A LARGER BAND OF SHOWERS WAS BTWN US AND DEST. THERE WAS YELLOW ON DOWNLINK THROUGHOUT THE FRONT AND A COUPLE OF MORE INTENSE RAINFALL AREAS IN THE YELLOW. I THOUGHT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO AVOID THE HEAVIER RAIN AND THEREFORE TURB BY AVOIDING THE DARKER AREAS OF PRECIP. WE VERY QUICKLY ENTERED SEVERE TURB AND IMMEDIATELY DID A 180 DEG TO EXIT THE PRECIP. PRIOR TO ENTERING THE PRECIP WE INFORMED ATC THAT WE WERE GOING TO DEVIATE TO AVOID THE HEAVIER RAIN. THEY APPROVED DEV INITIALLY AND ALSO WARNED US OF HVY AREAS OF PRECIP. AFTER WE REVERSED COURSE; WE CALLED ATC AND INFORMED THEM THAT WE WERE DOING A 180 DEGS WITH NO RESPONSE. AFTER GETTING KNOCKED AROUND IN THE TURB I DECIDED TO GET DOWN TO THE NEAREST ARPT WITH AN IFR APCH AND LAND AND WAIT OUT THE WX ON THE GND. I CALLED ATC AND INFORMED OF DEV TO ALTOONA AND AGAIN NO RESPONSE. ATC THEN STARTED CALLING AND WE KEPT ON TRYING TO COMMUNICATE AND NEITHER WAS GETTING THROUGH TO THE OTHER. WHEN THEY FINALLY RESPONDED TO OUR CALL WE WERE CHEWED OUT FOR DEVIATING ALT AND HDG WITHOUT CLRNC. I WAS ON APCH TO THE ALTOONA ARPT AT THIS POINT AND QUICKLY BROKE OUT OF CLOUDS AND CANCELED IFR SO AS TO KEEP OUT OF ARGUMENT WITH ATC. MY REASON FOR QUICKLY STARTING THE APCH WAS THE PREVIOUS BAND OF WX WAS CLOSING OUR BACK DOOR AND AT 8000 FT WE HAD TO GET DOWN IN A HURRY TO MAKE THE APCH BEFORE THE OTHER STORM MOVED IN ON US. I DID NOT HAVE ANY ROOM TO WAIT FOR ATC TO RESPOND. IN RETROSPECT I AM NOT SURE WHAT I COULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY ONCE WE ENTERED THE SEVERE TURB. I REALIZE CONFLICTS WITH OTHER ACFT WERE POSSIBLE BUT DIDN'T SEE AN OPTION WITH ATC NOT RESPONDING. IN THE FUTURE I WILL LAND BEFORE THE PRECIP AND TREAT ALL YELLOW PRECIP AS NO GO AREAS. THE DOWNLINK MIGHT HAVE GIVEN ME TOO MUCH CONFIDENCE. I HAD LOOKED AT CLOUD TOPS; MOVEMENT OF CELLS; STRIKE FINDER DATA AND DOWNLINK SPHERIC DATA AND SATELLITE DATA WHEN I MADE MY DECISIONS.

THE GEAR CAME DOWN AND LOCKED WITH GREEN LIGHTS. I STARTED A DSCNT ON THE 050 DEG HDG. ZFW CLRED ME TO 3700 FT ALT. I DSNDED AS FAST AS POSSIBLE TO THAT ALT BUT WENT THROUGH IT ON DSCNT AS THE SMOKE ON THE FLT DECK WAS GETTING WORSE AND HOT HYD FLUID WAS SPRAYING ON MY RIGHT LEG. MY CONCERN AT THAT MOMENT WAS GETTING THE ACFT ON THE GND SAFELY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. BY THIS TIME I HAD THE ARPT IN SIGHT. I INFORMED CTR OF THIS AND THEY ASKED IF I WANTED TO CANCEL IFR. I TOLD THEM TO CANCEL MY IFR AND I CONTINUED TO A QUICK LNDG. ZFW NEVER CALLED OUT ANY CONFLICTING TFC DURING THE DSCNT. THERE WERE NO INJURIES OR DAMAGE EXCEPT TO THE HYD PROB ITSELF.

ON A DIRECT RTE FROM FAT; WITH A SIGNIFICANT TAILWIND IT BECAME APPARENT THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DSND FAST ENOUGH TO GET BELOW THE 4000 FT CLASS B SHELF S OF EL MONTE. THE CTLR SUGGESTED A 360 DEG TURN FOR DSCNT; BUT I PREFERRED TO SIMPLY ALTER COURSE TO THE E TO DSND BELOW THE 7000 FT SHELF. HOWEVER; THE CTLR ADVISED ME NOT TO CONTINUE AN EBOUND DSCNT DUE TO TFC BELOW ME AND AGAIN SUGGESTED TO CONTINUE THE L TURN AND ROLL OUT BACK ON A SOUTHEASTERLY HDG EL MONTE TOWARD SNA OVER. I LOWERED THE LNDG GEAR TO HELP STAY SLOW IN TURBULENT AIR IN A RAPID DSCNT. I AM SURE THE PAX WONDERED WHAT WAS GOING ON. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL TO HAVE HAD A FLT DECK TFC DISPLAY SO I COULD SEE EXACTLY WHERE WAS THE TFC BELOW ME; THEN MAINTAIN VISUAL SEPARATION; AND PROCEED EBOUND UNDER THE 7000 FT LAX CLASS B SHELF RATHER THAN HAVING TO PERFORM A 360 DEG TURN.

I WAS MONITORING WACO APCH; THOUGH NOT IN CONTACT WITH THEM. I HEARD WACO APCH'S ALARM GO OFF IN THE BACKGROUND WHILE WACO APCH WAS XMITTING TO SOMEONE. THEY GAVE AN ACFT A TA WHICH INCLUDED THE WARNING THAT THEY HAD TFC DIRECTLY AHEAD AT THEIR 12 O'CLOCK POS. APPARENTLY HE DID NOT ALTER HIS DIRECTION OF FLT BECAUSE THE NEXT THING THAT HAPPENED SEVERAL SECONDS LATER IS THAT I SAW AN ACFT COMING TOWARDS ME FROM THE SE JUST AS HE PULLED UP AND PASSED VERY CLOSE OVER THE TOP OF ME. I THEN HEARD THE CTLR QUERY HIM. HE REPLIED THAT HE HAD JUST SEEN THE OTHER ACFT PASS JUST BELOW HIM. MY ZAON TFC ALERTER HAD GIVEN ME A WARNING; BUT IT SHOWED THE OTHER ACFT COMING FROM A DIRECTION AT ABOUT 90 DEGS TO THE L OF MY FLT PATH; AND SO I WAS VISUALLY SEARCHING AT THE HORIZON ON MY L. SINCE I DID NOT SEE THE OTHER ACFT; EVEN WITH A WIDE SCAN; I WONDER IF IT WAS CLBING UP TOWARDS ME SUCH THAT I DID NOT SEE IT IN THE GND CLUTTER TO THE SE. IF SO; HE SHOULD HAVE EASILY DETECTED ME SINCE MY AIRPLANE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOVE THE HORIZON IN HIS VIEW. THE OTHER ACFT WAS HEADING NW AT WHAT I WOULD GUESS TO BE A HDG OF ABOUT 300 DEGS. IF THE OTHER ACFT WAS IN CRUISE; THEN THE OTHER ACFT WAS NOT AN APPROPRIATE ALT FOR HIS DIRECTION OF FLT. HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT EVEN +500 FT IF HE WAS FLYING VFR (4500 FT OR 6500 FT); OR ON A 1000 FT ALT IF HE WAS IFR (5000 FT OR 6000 FT). HOWEVER; HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CLBING OR DSNDING. WHAT I LEARNED FROM THIS IS THE FOLLOWING: 1) I MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF IF I HAD BEEN ON FLT FOLLOWING MYSELF INSTEAD OF JUST MONITORING THE WACO APCH FREQ. 2) YOU CAN'T TRUST THE EVEN/ODD CRUISE RULES. SOME PLTS DON'T FOLLOW THEM; AND BESIDES THAT; THE PLT MAY BE CLBING OR DSNDING. 3) THE TFC ALERTER IS NOT VERY ACCURATE ON DIRECTION. DON'T ASSUME THAT IT IS CORRECT TO THE NEAREST 45 DEGS.

I DID NOT COME INTO THE PROJECT UNTIL THE CYLINDERS CAME BACK FROM THE OVERHAUL SHOP. THE OVERHAUL SHOP PROVIDED THE PISTON RINGS AND THE CYLINDER GASKET KITS. AT THAT TIME I VERIFIED THAT THE RINGS WERE THE RIGHT ONES FOR THIS INSTALLATION. THE GASKET KIT APPEARED TO BE THE RIGHT ONE; SO I DIDN'T VERIFY THE PART NUMBERS OF ALL THE GASKETS. I PROCEEDED TO INSTALL THE CYLINDERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MAINT MANUAL. I TORQUED THE CYLINDER FLANGE NUTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MANUFACTURER SPECS AND HAD A CO-WORKER RECHK THE TORQUES. AT THAT POINT; THE CO-WORKER PROCEEDED TO FINISH THE INSTALLATION OF THE INTAKE AND EXHAUST. THE TEST RUN SHOWED NORMAL ENG FUNCTION AND HE RETURNED THE ACFT TO SVC. ON THE INITIAL FLT BY THE OWNER; HE WAS CLBING THROUGH 14000 FT WHEN HE NOTICED LOW OIL PRESSURE. SHORTLY AFTER THAT HE LOST MANIFOLD PRESSURE. AT THAT POINT HE RETURNED TO THE FIELD IMMEDIATELY AND HAD US LOOK AT THE PROB. AFTER TROUBLESHOOTING; WE DECIDED TO REMOVE THE CYLINDERS FOR INSPECTION. THE FIRST THING THAT WE FOUND WAS THE CYLINDER FLANGE NUTS WERE VERY LOOSE AND IN SOME CASES ONLY FINGER TIGHT. WE THEN HAD DIFFICULTY REMOVING THE CYLINDERS. WHEN WE FINALLY GOT THEM OFF WE FOUND THE CYLINDER BASE O-RINGS TO HAVE MELTED INTO THE SPACE IN BTWN THE CYLINDER AND THE CRANK CASE. WE ALSO FOUND THE OIL SCRAPER RING TO BE SEIZED ON ONE PISTON AND WE FOUND HALF OF THE SKIRT BROKEN OFF THE OTHER PISTON AND MOST OF THE OIL SCRAPER RING MISSING. AT THAT POINT WE DECIDED TO SEND THE CYLINDERS OUT TO A DIFFERENT OVERHAUL SHOP FOR AN INDEPENDENT OPINION ON WHAT HAPPENED. THEY TOLD US THAT ALTHOUGH THE OIL SCRAPER RING WAS INSTALLED PER INDUSTRY STANDARD; THAT THEY NORMALLY INSTALLED THIS PARTICULAR BRAND OF OIL SCRAPER RING WITH THE PART NUMBER FACING DOWN; CONTRARY TO INDUSTRY STANDARD. THEY STATED THAT THE OIL SCRAPER RING DOESN'T PROVIDE ADEQUATE LUBRICATION WHEN THE RING IS INSTALLED WITH THE PART NUMBER FACING UP. WHEN WE CONTACTED THE SHOP THAT OVERHAULED THE CYLINDERS TO ASK WHAT THEIR METHOD OF INSTALLING THE OIL SCRAPER RINGS WAS; THEY SAID IT WAS TO INSTALL THEM WITH THE PART NUMBER UP. THEY ALSO TOLD US THAT WE WERE SENT A CYLINDER GASKET KIT FOR AN IO-470 INSTEAD OF A GASKET KIT FOR AN IO-520; STATING THEY WERE IDENTICAL. WE DECIDED TO CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER OF THE GASKET KIT AND ASK THEM IF THERE WAS ANY DIFFERENCE IN THE TWO KITS. THE MANUFACTURER TOLD US THAT THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WAS THE CYLINDER BASE O-RING WAS THICKER. I BELIEVE THAT WHAT HAPPENED; BASED ON THE FACTS GIVEN; IS THAT THE ACFT LOST MANIFOLD PRESSURE ON THE INITIAL FLT DUE TO LOW OIL PRESSURE BECAUSE THE OIL PASSAGEWAYS WERE BECOMING CLOGGED WITH METAL; THEREFORE; NOT ALLOWING THE WASTE GATES FOR THE TURBOCHARGER TO CLOSE. I THINK THE PISTON SKIRT BROKE OFF FROM THE LACK OF TORQUE ON CYLINDER FLANGE NUTS. THE LOW TORQUE WAS A RESULT OF THE O-RINGS BEING TOO THICK AND QUICKLY GAVE WAY UNDER THE HEAT AND PRESSURE OF THE ENG RUNNING. OTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTORS MAY HAVE BEEN THE OIL SCRAPER RINGS NOT PROVIDING ADEQUATE LUBRICATION DUE TO THE WAY THEY WERE INSTALLED. THINGS I WILL DO DIFFERENTLY IN THE FUTURE: I WILL VERIFY ALL PARTS WERE THE CORRECT ONES FOR THE INSTALLATION AND I WILL USE ORIGINAL MANUFACTURER RINGS.",,,,"A CESSNA 210N ACFT WITH TSIO-510 ENGINE EXPERIENCED LOW OIL PRESSURE AND ENGINE FAILURE ON INITIAL FLIGHT AFTER A TWO CYLINDER OVERHAUL.",

AFTER THE WARRIOR LANDED; I CALLED 'POS AND HOLD' THINKING THE HELI WAS STILL ON DOWNWIND. I COULD NOT SEE THE HELI; SINCE THEY (THE CHOPPERS THAT ARE THERE NOW) ALWAYS FLY A VERY LOW PATTERN.

I MADE MULTIPLE ANNOUNCEMENTS REGARDING OUR EXTENDED DOWNWIND AND OUR R BASE CLOSE TO THE N SHORELINE; AND THEN ANNOUNCED A 2 MI FINAL FOR RWY XX AND LOCATED A PIPER CHEROKEE ON CLOSE-IN DOWNWIND.

A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN THIS EVENT WAS THE DECISION OF A PLT TO DEPART RWY YY AGAINST TFC AND AGAINST THE CALM-WIND ADVISORY RWY XX. THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTING FACTOR WAS THE FAILURE OF THE PIPER PLT TO FLY A STANDARD TFC PATTERN. HE OMITTED THE 45 DEG TO THE R DOWNWIND LEG AND ENTERED A CLOSE IN EXTENDED R DOWNWIND. HE THEN FAILED TO ANNOUNCE R DOWNWIND AND FAILED TO LISTEN AND UNDERSTAND THE FACT THAT 2 ACFT WERE IN THE PATTERN AHEAD OF HIM AND BOTH WERE EXTENDING THEIR DOWNWIND LEGS BECAUSE OF TFC. HE THEN TURNED BASE WITHOUT LOOKING TO HIS L AND SEEING ONCOMING TFC.

THE RADIOS WERE POWERED UP; HOWEVER; RADIOS WOULD NOT XMIT; AND THE RECEIVE SIGNALS WERE INTERMITTENT AND EXTREMELY WEAK. ADDITIONAL ELECTRICAL SYS ISSUES WERE OBSERVED INCLUDING INTERMITTENT INDICATORS LIGHTS. BASED ON THE APPARENT ELECTRICAL SYS PROBS; LOSS OF EFFECTIVE RADIO COMS; AND LACK OF ATC CTL OF OR COMS WITH ACFT IN THE VICINITY OF ZZZ1; THE PLT'S IMMEDIATE FOCUS AND EFFORT WAS TO MAINTAIN VFR FLT IN VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS; MAINTAIN VISUAL SEPARATION FROM ALL OTHER ACFT; AND MAINTAIN SAFE CTL OF THE ACFT WHILE ATTEMPTING TO RESTORE THE ELECTRICAL AND COMS SYS. ADDITIONAL INFLT INSPECTION REVEALED NO OUTPUT FROM EITHER OF THE ALTERNATORS AND THE SYS VOLTAGE HAD DROPPED TO APPROX 18-20V. THE PLT OBSERVED BOTH ALTERNATORS IN THE ON POS. HOWEVER; RECYCLING OF 1 OF THE ALTERNATOR SWITCHES PARTIALLY RESTORED THE CHARGING SYS AND PROVIDED ADDITIONAL VOLTAGE. WITHIN APPROX 3-4 MINS OF DEP; AND WHILE STILL TRYING TO RESOLVE THE ELECTRICAL AND COM SYS PROBS; THE PLT EVENTUALLY ESTABLISHED INITIAL CONTACT WITH DEP CTL; ALBEIT SOMEWHAT LIMITED AND DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND. AMONGST THE DISTRS AND CONFUSION; AND WHILE STILL ATTEMPTING TO COMPLETELY RESTORE THE ELECTRICAL SYS; THE PLT ATTEMPTED TO ESTABLISH INITIAL CONTACT AND REQUEST TO CONTINUE A CLB THROUGH 2500 FT. ADDITIONAL RADIO COMS PROBS ENSUED; WHERE THE PLT UNDERSTOOD THE CTLR TO BE ACKNOWLEDGING THE CLB FROM EITHER 2000 FT OR 2500 FT TO 20000 FT AND REQUESTING THE PLT TO CONFIRM THE SAME. WHEN TRYING TO CONFIRM THE CLB AND ALTS; THE CTLR GREW INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED AND ADVISED THE PLT THAT HE WAS FILED TO 19000 FT AND CLRED TO 2000 FT AT 090 DEGS. THE PLT APOLOGIZED FOR THE CONFUSION AND ATTEMPTED TO CONVEY TO THE CTLR THAT HE WAS EXPERIENCING PROBS WITH THE ACFT'S SYS. THE PLT THEN ATTEMPTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND COMPLY WITH THE SAME; HOWEVER; THE CTLR ISSUED NEW INSTRUCTIONS TO CLB TO A NEW ALT AND NEW COURSE HDG. IRRESPECTIVE OF THE PROBS AND DISTRS THE PLT WAS DEALING WITH; THE CTLR APPEARED TO GROW INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED AND REQUESTED THE PLT COPY A PHONE NUMBER SEVERAL TIMES DURING THIS PERIOD; WHICH FURTHER RATTLED THE PLT AS HE TRIED TO MAINTAIN CTL; FULLY REESTABLISH THE ELECTRICAL AND COMS SYS; AS WELL AS REPROGRAM THE NAV AND AUTOPLT SYS. THE TOTAL DURATION INVOLVING THE INCIDENT WAS APPROX 4 MINS WHICH OCCURRED WITHIN APPROX 5 MI OF ZZZ1. THE PLT WAS ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MAINTAIN ADEQUATE VISUAL SEPARATION FROM ALL OTHER ACFT IN THE VICINITY OF THE CLASS E AIRSPACE DURING THAT TIME. THE REMAINDER OF THE FLT WAS COMPLETED WITHOUT FURTHER ISSUE. AFTER LNDG AT ZZZ2 THE PLT CALLED THE NUMBER AND ADVISED OF THE ELECTRICAL SYS FAILURE; LOSS OF COMS AND AUTOPLT PROB. THE ATC PERSON TOOK THE PLT'S INFO AND ADVISED THAT NO OTHER ACFT WERE IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT AND CONFIRMED THAT NO ACFT SEPARATION CONFLICTS HAD OCCURRED INVOLVING THE PLT'S ACFT. EVAL OF THE ELECTRICAL AND COM SYS DURING THE INCIDENT REVEALED THAT THE OVER-VOLTAGE REGULATORS HAD TRIPPED. THE SYS VOLTAGE HAD DROPPED TO APPROX 18-20V; WHICH CAUSED THE RADIO DISPLAYS TO REMAIN POWERED UP BUT NOT ABLE TO XMIT OR RECEIVE PROPERLY. THE FAILURE ALSO INTRODUCED OTHER RELATED ISSUES INCLUDING INTERRUPTION OF AUTOPLT PART WAY THROUGH THE INITIAL TURN AND LEAVING THE TRIM IN A CONTINUED CLB STATE. RECYCLING OF BOTH ALTERNATORS EVENTUALLY REESTABLISHED THE CORRECT SYS VOLTAGE AND PROPER OP OF THE ACFT'S SYS. FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT; THE PLT CAREFULLY CONSIDERED THE SITUATION AND TOOK THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS TO AVOID ANY FUTURE OCCURRENCE: 1) THE SUBJECT ACFT'S VOLTAGE REGULATORS WERE AGAIN CHKED AND RECALIBRATED AFTER THE INCIDENT TO ENSURE CORRECT OP; 2) THE ENTIRE COM AND NAV SYS WAS SCHEDULED TO BE REPLACED WITH A COMPLETELY NEW SYS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT; 3) THE PLT OBTAINED ADDITIONAL TRAINING SURROUNDING EMER PROCS AND HOW TO BEST HANDLE AND MANAGE PRIORITIZATION OF ATC REQUEST DURING SYS FAILURES. THE REVIEW INCLUDED PROPER PROCEDURAL AND COM PROTOCOL DURING SYS FAILURES; EMERS AND HIGH STRESS SITUATIONS IN ADDITION TO PROPER ATC COMS.",,,,"PRESSURIZED C210 PLT EXPERIENCES LOSS OF AC GENERATION AND COM DIFFICULTIES WHILE ON AN IFR FLT.",

THE RECEIVING CTLR INITIATED A MANUAL TRACK START BY TYPING IN ACFT IDENT AND TRACKBALL SLEWING OUT TO IT. THE ACFT WAS THEN ELECTRONICALLY HANDED OFF TO ME. APPROX 7 MINS LATER THE ACFT OVERFLEW DAB AND THE DATA TAG DROPPED OFF. THIS LEFT A SMALL PRIMARY TARGET ONLY. I WAS BUSY WITH SEVERAL IFR OVERFLTS; ARRS; AND DEPS. APPROX 9 MINS LATER; THE TFC RUSH SUBSIDED. UPON REVIEWING MY FLT PROGRESS STRIPS; I REALIZED THAT THIS C210 WAS MISSING. I STARTED A WIDE SCAN AND FOUND HIM 15 MI OUTSIDE MY AIRSPACE AND WELL INTO MCO'S. THE ACFT DID NOT CONFLICT WITH ANY OTHER; AND APPROPRIATE IFR SEPARATION WAS NEVER LOST. I REALIZE THAT I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFETY OF ALL ACFT IN MY JURISDICTION AND HAVE REVISED MY CTL TECHNIQUE ACCORDINGLY. HOWEVER; THERE ARE A FEW DISTURBING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS OPERROR. 1) THE INITIAL CTLR TAGGED THE NON MODE C ACFT INCORRECTLY. (I DID NOT KNOW.) THE TRACK SHOULD HAVE BEEN INITIATED FROM THE TAB LIST. HE RECEIVED NO SHARE OF BLAME. CORRECTIVE ACTION: TEACH CTLRS THE CORRECT METHOD FOR TAGGING A PRIMARY TARGET AND THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF INCORRECT METHODS. 2) STARS IS NOT PROGRAMMED FOR SAFETY. STARS HAS THE ABILITY TO CATEGORIZE ALL TRACKS AS DEPS; ARRS OR ENRTE. THE SOFTWARE IS WRITTEN IN SUCH A WAY THAT ALL MANUAL TRACK STARTS ARE ARRS. ALL ARPTS HAVE A 'DROP BOX' CREATED OVER THE ARPT PROPER. THIS PREVENTS DATA TAGS FROM ACCUMULATING OVER THE ARPT AND CLUTTERING THE INDICATORS. BY ITSELF -- A GREAT FUNCTION. THE SAFETY ISSUE IS THAT AN ENRTE ACFT WITH A MANUAL TAG IS SEEN AS AN ARR. IF IT OVERFLIES THE ARPT PROPER; THE SOFTWARE DROPS THE TAG. CORRECTIVE ACTION: A SAFE AND EASY FIX IS TO REPROGRAM STARS ON A NATIONAL LEVEL TO SEE ALL MANUAL TRACK STARTS AS ENRTE. THE ONLY DRAWBACK FOR CTLRS IS A FEW EXTRA KEYSTROKES TO MANUALLY DROP THE TAG. TAGS WOULD NEVER JUST DROP OFF. I COULD ONLY IMAGINE THIS SCENARIO PLAYING OUT IN ATL OR NEW YORK TRACON. I BELIEVE THE FAA IS WILLING TO CLOSE THIS CASE AND CALL IT AN OPERROR. THE REAL PROB IS THE SOFTWARE. THERE ARE SO MANY QUIRKS TO STARS THAT ARE NOT TAUGHT; BUT RATHER LEARNED ON THE JOB OR PASSED ON FROM ATCS TO ATCS.

I believe the cause was that I forgot to switch the fuel tank selector at the appropriate time and the right tank ran dry; starving the engine of fuel. During the incident; I glided below my assigned altitude and had to leave my assigned heading to look for a suitable place to land if necessary. I also made a 'Mayday' call to DEN Approach and informed them the engine had failed. I started the flight with the right tank selected. I switched to the (full) left tank and was able to restart the engine and continue to the destination. I intended to switch tanks approximately 1/2 way to the destination. Apparently; I forgot to switch tanks; because the selector was still on the right tank when the engine stopped. A contributing factor was that almost all of my flying experience has been in aircraft having a 'both' setting on the fuel selector; so I didn't have to switch tanks inflight. The 2 airplanes I have flown that lacked a 'both' setting each had a GPS that provided periodic reminders to switch tanks. However; the GPS in the incident aircraft had recently been upgraded with WAAS capability and all its settings had been returned to the factory defaults; which did not include the periodic reminders to switch tanks. My plan to switch tanks at the 1/2 way point was a poor plan. The logic was that if I could make it 1/2 way on 1 tank; I should have enough fuel in the other tank to complete the flight. The problem was it left the plane imbalanced with hundreds more pounds of fuel in one wing than the other. In the future; I will switch tanks every 30 minutes. I missed clues that might have alerted me to the problem. First; the autopilot failed to hold a heading; and the plane began an uncommanded turn to the left. I turned off the autopilot and noted a left-rolling tendency. At first I thought a passenger's bag was putting pressure on the Copilot's yoke; but moving the bag did not help. I looked around to see if something had happened to the airframe but saw nothing unusual. I assumed that the autopilot had stuck with a bungee pulling to the left. Only after I landed did I realize that the left-rolling tendency was caused by the imbalance of fuel. When the engine stopped; I acted in accordance with my emergency training. I established best glide speed; selected a possible landing site; switched tanks; and restarted the engine.",,,,"Cessna Turbo 210 pilot fails to switch tanks in a timely fashion and suffers temporary engine failure and altitude/track deviations while recovering.",

I was given an IFR clearance and a specific squawk code and began my descent. While in my descent; the Controller further gave me the option to stay IFR with him and he would take me into PDK/Atlanta. If I remained with him; I would have to stop my descent at 5;000 FT MSL; if not; I would have to descend to 3;500 FT MSL to resume my VFR flight. I asked the Controller what was easiest for him; and he responded that there was no difference to him; just that I had to let him know what I wanted to do. I responded that I would just go in VFR. The Controller took that to mean that I wanted to cancel my IFR clearance. I did not understand that my IFR clearance was being canceled and my answer was taken in the affirmative by ATC. I did not understand my IFR clearance was being canceled mainly because I was never told to change my squawk back to 1200; VFR. After being handed over to ATL Approach; I was asked to do something by the Controller and I informed the Controller that I was descending IMC.

They asked what we wanted to do; and I informed them that we would continue to the destination airport; Columbia; SC; which was approximately 75 miles away.

We had a Mechanic check into the condition of the plane and determined that the left fuel tank was empty; although the left fuel gauge showed more than half a tank.

When the fuel truck arrived at the hangar; I told the technician to fill it to the top. After getting fueled; I performed a thorough preflight inspection of the aircraft. After a lengthy flight; I initiated a hard left turn to set up for my return flight. Without warning; the engine quit. I immediately began going through my memorized emergency procedures. I confirmed that the fuel selector valve was on 'Both.' While doing this; I noticed the right tank was indicating empty. I immediately switched tanks to the left tank; which was indicating slightly below 10 gallons; and tried to restart the engine. As I was trying the restart; I spotted an open area of beach. I quickly told the crew to brace for an emergency landing as I turned toward that open section of beach. I lowered the gear and initiated a soft-field landing away from any civilians. After coming to a stop; I checked to make sure everyone was OK. Not knowing the cause of the engine failure; I had everyone disembark the aircraft while I checked the engine. I contacted our Chief Mechanic to discuss the problem. We discussed the fuel and he asked if I had a positive fuel flow. I climbed into the cockpit and confirmed that the left tank was reading slightly less than 10 gallons and there was a positive fuel flow to the engine. He asked me to restart the engine. With the fuel selector on the left tank; I was able to restart the engine. I believe that the incident was caused due to the limited amount of fuel from the right wing 'running' into the far tip of the left wing during steep turns toward the left wing. Since there is no fuel 'port' on the tip of the wings; the plane was starved for fuel and the engine quit. This occurred even with 10 gallons of fuel remaining in the left tank. Also; a better understanding of the fuel system would have prevented me from allowing the fuel to get this low while performing steep turns.",,,,"Despite ten gallons of fuel remaining in one tank; a Cessna 210 Pilot suffered an engine failure due to fuel starvation near the end of a long flight.",

As reported to me: The subject aircraft was on the second flight; following maintenance when the Owner/Pilot and his Instructor noted higher than normal engine cylinder head temperature on cylinder 6 and I believe the loss of cylinder head temperature on cylinder 4. Shortly after these indications the Pilot and Instructor reported some smoke in the cockpit and some power decline. They then proceeded to a nearby airport; and suspecting a possible fire; when within gliding distance; moved the engine mixture control to idle cutoff and the fuel selector control to the off position. Following landing; it was noted that the left hand side of the engine cowling had severe heat damage (paint and deformed aluminum sheet metal skin. The Pilots called me to inform of the event. In accordance with the rules; the pilot called the FAA FSDO and reported the event and forced precautionary landing.As I was out of town; I dispatched my business partner also an A&P; IA; who arrived the next day to examine the aircraft and attempt to determine cause. When the cowling was removed it was noted that the cylinder 4 exhaust riser; which is 'slip jointed' into the left hand exhaust riser assembly had separated from the cylinder exhaust flange causing the escape of hot exhaust gases into adjacent areas resulting damage to cowling; electrical wiring; and adjacent cast aluminum induction tubing. It was also noted that at least one of the four exhaust riser flange retaining nuts was lying in the lower cowl area below the number 4 cylinder. This exhaust riser had been previously removed and reinstalled for access to perform other engine work. It is possible; if not likely; that the riser stud nuts were under torqued at installation and this defect was not discovered during final inspection prior to return to service. As the riser stud nut are of the self locking type it may also be possible that the nuts had lost their locking feature through age and being subject to continuous extreme heat. Future further examination will be conducted to determine the exact cause.Two subordinates; one low experience and one very senior; under my charge had performed the work and I returned the aircraft to service. The chain of events and considerations I believe at this point; it may be assumed the subordinate Technician failed to adequately torque the retaining hardware and to properly re-check his work. Further; inspection personnel failed to perform more than a visual inspection; which would not detect an under-torque condition. A low experience Technician's work should have been even more closely inspected and supervised by Senior Technicians.  Company installation and assembly procedures were not followed.  Company final inspection policies were followed; but were inadequate in this case and shall be revised to include an Inspector torque check of all critical hardware and fasteners.  A company policy requiring a flight test and an additional inspection following any critical maintenance shall be instated.  A company policy requiring the replacement of all self locking hardware with new (hardware); on critical components during reassembly shall be instated.  The company policy manual shall be revised to reflect these and further changes arising form this event.  Management will pursue a more active role in human factors management; supervision; and quality control.  Even though the submitter was not the person who performed the actual work; the submitter feels and is aware that; as the person returning the aircraft to service; he is ultimately responsible for the finished product to be free of defects to the best of his knowledge.","Reporter stated there is an issue with maintaining torque of self-locking nuts; that are installed in high heat engine exhaust environments. Many of these nuts are very difficult to reach and torque; around the exhaust flanges. He personally has noticed loose exhaust lock nuts; after only one or two hours of flight time; many times after new exhaust gaskets have been installed; or previously used lock nuts from exhaust manifolds were reused. The engine he is reporting about is a turbocharged Continental-Teledyne six cylinder.Reporter stated the exhaust heat temperature from a Turbocharged engine; averages 1000 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than a normally aspirated engine. With the separation of the 'slip jointed' exhaust riser from the cylinder exhaust flange; a three to four inch exhaust flame was projecting itself into the engine compartment.Reporter stated that he has also implemented a new company policy; that requires an agreed to mandatory re-inspection and re-torque of all self-locking exhaust nuts that were installed; or disturbed; after an engine overhaul or exhaust section repair.",,,"The owner of an aircraft maintenance facility; reports about a Turbocharged Cessna P210 Pilot and Instructor; who experienced smoke in the cockpit and power loss; requiring engine shutdown and landing.

Runway XY was clear except for a small truck parked the edge of the runway. Dealing with a small truck on the edge of XY seemed much less risky than several airplanes on the active Runway XX. It turned out to be battery failure. However; at the time I didn't realize that and it didn't manifest itself all at once. I could receive but could not transmit. Then other failures occurred. Eventually I had no electrical power at all; not even gear lights. I had started the flight with 50 gallons of gas but seeing the gauges at zero didn't help. The stress was beginning to mount. I wanted to get on the ground quickly and as safely as possible. I felt that I had a real emergency. I landed on Runway XY; the closed runway; without incident.

While at an assigned altitude of 6000 ft; with 6000 indicating on the altimeter; I began trouble shooting the suspected heading error. I first reset the DG to the compass; a routine IFR procedure. But the discrepancy reoccurred within a few minutes. At that point I began cross-checking among the DG; compass; and portable GPS. Since the GPS was not my own; and had recently been placed on the top of the glareshield next to the compass by the FBO that rented the aircraft; I was concerned that the GPS might be interfering with the compass. I turned my attention to removing the GPS from its mount; and in so doing noticed the compass did turn. The GPS interfered with the compass when the GPS was out of its cradle. I removed the GPS with some difficulty; from the glareshield and placed it on the co-pilot's seat. At that point ATC called to say I was at 6400 feet. Upon returning to 6000 ft the flight continued nominally. I did discoverer that the DG was precessing and the major DG drift may have been the original cause of heading uncertainty. It also appeared that when the GPS was firmly affixed in its cradle it did not interfere with the compass; only when dislodged and slid off the glareshield; immediately adjacent to the compass; as occurred when I was troubleshooting. There were no traffic conflicts during the altitude excursion.  In retrospect; once the standard IFR procedure of resetting the DG to the compass failed; instead of attempting to troubleshoot a possible compass error caused by the portable GPS; I should have contacted ATC. While they could not have given me heading information; only track information; that at least would have confirmed or denied what the GPS was telling me. A secondary purpose would have been to alert ATC that the pilot was distracted by a navigation problem and may need early altitude alerts. This was all clear in hindsight; but not during the distraction.",,,,"C210 pilot reports altitude deviation while attempting to trouble shoot a directional gyro problem at 6000 feet.",

I do not recall my aileron input during the attempted recovery.  The plane rolled into the grass and came to a stop.  Per information Papa; the wind was 270 degrees at 10 KTS.  I do not remember anything special about the landing until the plane started veering toward the left side of the runway.

He asked for the weather at ZZZ2; but I was busy trying to get ORD arrivals descended and sequenced; and didn't read the weather to him.  He asked for the weather again; I read it; he then decided he wouldn't be able to land at ZZZ2 either and declared an emergency and turned to a 270 heading for ZZZ3. I stopped his descent at 110 and cleared him direct ZZZ3.  The aircraft went NORDO multiple times while in the sector; and also lost the transponder.  Proper coordination was done between the next sector and the D-Side.  The pilot told us that he didn't know how much longer he was going to be on frequency because of the electrical issue.  I gave him the frequency for the next sector; so that he could contact Center again when able. A few minutes later we were informed that the aircraft was on the next frequency.  After the emergency was declared I failed to follow the emergency checklist.  The Supervisor On Duty was notified immediately of the situation. Recommendation; I should have followed the emergency checklist.  Also; I could have suggested a closer to airport the aircraft's proximity. There were two other options.",,"I was conducting OJTI (on job training) at the time of the event. Aircraft X was filed @ 15000; he said that he was having a little bit of an electrical problem and was looking to divert (no emergency was declared at this time and did not request special handling). My Trainee suggested ZZZ1. The Pilot suggested ZZZ2 and requested the weather. My Trainee cleared Aircraft X to ZZZ2 and descended him to 9000; but did not get the weather information to him until the 2nd request; due to sequencing for ORD (he did bring up the weather at ZZZ2 the first time Aircraft X requested it; just never issued it). Aircraft X changed his mind about ZZZ2 because of conditions at ZZZ2 and wanted to go to a 270 heading. My Trainee stopped Aircraft X at 11000 and turned him to a 270 heading. About this time Aircraft X declared an emergency and requested the weather at ZZZ3. My Trainee got the weather for ZZZ3 and gave it to him and Aircraft X requested to divert to ZZZ3. Aircraft X was then cleared to ZZZ3. Aircraft X lost his transponder and also his radios were in and out of operation. We made all of the coordination to the other sectors and transfered radio communication to the next sector. Aircraft X never read the frequency back; however we called the next sector to make sure he got to the their frequency. Recommendation; I was letting my Trainee handle the situation on his own because he is close to completing his training. I should have instructed my Trainee a little better on how to handle the emergency. We never got the passengers on board or the fuel remaining in time. I also think that maybe we could have suggested a closer airport.",,"Enroute controllers; a Developmental and his/her Instructor; described an emergency event when all the technical rules of handling emergency aircraft were not completed.",

I acknowledged and told Houston I was already essentially direct.  Track about 014.  Center was working light to moderate amount of traffic.  During the climb; I heard several light aircraft ask for flight following service.  I got the impression via listening to radio traffic that the male Center Controller was young and perhaps inexperienced.  It was a matter of tone of voice and how he responded to requests and issued advisories; sounded well trained but maybe not highly experienced.  As I climbed over 3;000 feet; I heard a male voice with a slight accent identify himself as a Cessna 182 VFR from west of College Station en route to West Houston.  I don't know if the advisory request was honored or not.  When I was climbing to about 3;500 feet; I got a call from Center advising me of traffic; one mile; one o'clock; east bound; 3;600 feet.  I considered that pretty close and immediately straightened up and looked to the right front of the aircraft and told my passenger in the right seat that there was an airplane pretty close to us and please let me know if she saw anything.  I saw nothing and reported negative contact.  Very soon thereafter Center called me again and about this time I saw the aircraft at about my eleven o'clock; slightly above me; moving left to right (west to east) about 400 feet ahead of me.  It was close enough that I could easily identify the aircraft as a Cessna high wing; fixed gear; white; that was a C172 or C182.  The ID number was big enough that I think I could have read it if I had focused on it.  My immediate reaction was that we would not collide as I would likely pass behind him; but I acted to initiate a precautionary left bank at about 20-30 degrees for 10 or 15 seconds and kept my eyes on him.  That was enough to ensure we would not converge.  I did not make a speed change.  The other aircraft continued in steady flight and made no control movement that I could see.  I told Center I had the traffic in sight.  After the plane cleared I resumed my course.  I did not notify ATC of the distance because they obviously knew we were close and once I attained visual contact they knew I was responsible for separation; which I immediately ensured.  I wonder if this was the Cessna that was asking for flight following.  I did not note the winds aloft at the time; but a little later when at 7;000; I noted my track was 007 and there was a slight wind from about 320 degrees.  To me; that means that my heading and track at 3500 feet were about the same and when I looked out the right front of the aircraft in response to a call of traffic at one o'clock I was searching in about the right place.  Why; then; was the aircraft seen at eleven o'clock?  I wonder if the controller was looking at the other aircraft when talking to me.  I would have been at the other aircraft's one o'clock.  During this phase of the climb out; I had a light cockpit workload.  I was not reconfiguring the aircraft or making avionics entries.  I was conducting normal traffic scans and monitoring Center.  I was not engaged with the passenger but was focused on flying the airplane.  The Center warning alerted me to extra vigilance and had me looking out the front of the aircraft with full attention.  I suspect that had Center not advised me; I would have seen the traffic later and might have been very close.  I wonder why Center had the other airplane off my right when it was off my left; given that my track and heading were pretty close.  This incident reinforced my awareness that 'see and avoid' is a primary responsibility whenever conditions permit.  It reminded me to take ATC traffic advisories seriously but also recognize that relative position may not be what is given by ATC and one needs to look all around.  I think my maneuvering was appropriate.  I think I should consciously expand my traffic scan pattern to be wider in scope and more deliberate.  I recently flew a formation course in which distances were estimated; so hopefully my guess of 400 feet is not too far off.",,,,"C210 pilot on IFR flight plan is informed of traffic at one o'clock and one mile.

I had to rely on Flight Data to input a 6;7;10 flight plan entry so this flight would process correctly to the appropriate ATC facilities along his route of flight. After Flight Data supposedly entered the 6;7;10 entry I still could not process an automated hand off to ZHU. At this time I had wasted too much time and needed to effect a hand off but had other separation duties required of me at that time with higher priority. So I was forced to request the FLM to make a manual hand off of the aircraft in question. There would have been an airspace deviation if this manual hand off was not done. Only after my session on RADAR was over was I able to look at the flight plan entry done by Flight Data. As it turns out the Flight Data Controller knowingly failed to input the 6;7;10 entry properly as directed by me; but intentionally entered the wrong fix; which caused the route of the flight plan to be inaccurate and ZHU had no information on this aircraft which further complicated the situation. This is not the first time this particular Controller has failed to be able to complete a simple 6;7;10 data entry.

This is generally used by the RADAR West (RW) and RADAR East Positions to assist the Austin Final (AF) Controller. The SOP also allows for a 'VA' to indicate that an aircraft has been cleared for a Visual Approach. On the day of this event; there were low scattered clouds that prevented AUS from advertising Visual Approaches on the ATIS. ILS Approaches were being advertised to Runway 17L and 17R. As a general rule; if an aircraft has been cleared for a VA under this type of situation; a 'VA' will be added to the data tag to inform the Tower Cab and other Positions that a specific aircraft has been cleared for a VA. This is beneficial to the Tower in the event that Stagger Spacing decreases to less than the 2.0 required; if one aircraft is known to be on a VA by the inclusion of 'VA' in the data tag; then the Tower does not need to break-out or reduce the speed of any arrivals. The Controller working next to me was placing 'A' and 'VA' in the data tags of aircraft on initial contact after I switched my aircraft to his sector frequency. Although some of these aircraft had the airport in sight; they were not on VA. Some aircraft had VA appended to their data tags on initial contact; thus informing the Tower and all other Controllers that a specific aircraft had been cleared for the VA; when in fact the aircraft had not been actually cleared for the VA. Some AUS Controllers use the 'A' entry to indicate that they have cleared the aircraft for a VA. So what is it? Does 'A' mean 'Airport in Sight'; or does it mean 'Cleared for Visual Approach'? Past practices and procedures that I have observed at other facilities have been to ONLY include the VA in the data tag if an aircraft had actually been cleared for a Visual Approach. AIS was used instead of the '.A' function; as AIS would be replaced with VA. I find it confusing and misleading as a RADAR Controller to see and know that the Final Controller is inputting incorrect information in the data tag that is essentially betting that an aircraft will report the airport in sight; or betting that the aircraft will be cleared for the visual approach. As a Tower Controller; I use the data tag information to determine whether I might need to issue a speed reduction; break-out; or go-around call to ensure spacing and separation. Recommendation; update the local ARTS Order and Procedures to indicate that 'AIS' is the only entry to be used for 'Airport In Sight'. AIS will be removed from the data tag by 'VA' to indicate that an aircraft has been cleared for a 'Visual Approach'; and this entry shall only be used when the aircraft has actually been cleared for the VA. We need to all use the same ARTS entries; and have the same understanding of what these entries mean.",,,,"AUS Controller voiced concern regarding the current facility practice of permitting several different data block entries to indicate visual approach information; suggesting the need for revised procedures.",

He was not in communications with ATC at the time.

The flight was flown at 20;000 FT; [and] above 7;000 FT the skies were clear. I used oxygen the entire flight until I descended below 8;000 FT near the completion of the flight. The flight was smooth and uneventful until the landing. ATIS stated skies with scattered clouds (can't remember height but airport was VFR) and wind was 190 at 12 KTS with gusts to 20 KTS. I was vectored for the visual approach at 3;000 FT. I loaded and activated the ILS in my GPS. I was vectored to the final approach and was asked by Approach how high I could keep my speed up during the approach and I answered 145 KTS. I was then asked to keep my speed up until 4-5 miles out. I agreed and complied. I was cleared for the visual approach at about 6 miles out and proceeded to join the localizer. The flight and the approach were flown with the autopilot activated. I was then switched over to Tower frequency and was cleared to land. The approach was uneventful and normal except for the increased air speed which was requested. I slowed the plane down about 3-4 miles out and started lowering flaps and landed unaware that I had forgotten to lower the landing gear until I heard metal scraping when I touched down. I did not hear the warning alarm which usually goes off if power is reduced under 15 inches manifold pressure when the gear is not extended. The plane then slid down the runway skidding to the right of the center line and came to rest on the runway. The landing was at approximately three hours after takeoff and I was not hurt.A contributing factor in my mind regarding this incident is that the approach was conducted out of normal sequence. I routinely lower the gear before starting the descent on an instrument approach at the final approach fix and on a visual approach I lower the gear before turning to final when being vectored. I cannot lower the gear in my plane above 140 KTS. Since I was requested to keep my airspeed at 145 KTS I delayed putting the gear down and unfortunately did not replay the normal landing sequence in my mind as I was slowing the plane down just prior to touchdown. I also suspect other contributing factors were the long flight; being by myself; and possibly the long period of relative hypoxia (SaO2 kept at 92% in flight); night time; and the fact that my gear horn malfunctioned. My concern is how do you train in a way that allows you to perform when you are at your worst mentally. You cannot always anticipate what your mental acuity will be when you arrive at your destination. I feel that all of the above listed components contributed to my incident. With hindsight being 20/20 my best judgment would say not to make that flight late in the afternoon; by myself; and at such a high altitude. How do you remember something that does not cross your mind? I really believe that this event would not have occurred if the approach was routine as I ran through my landing checklist in the usual manner but had to skip gear lowering due to the speed limitations for my airplane. I know now that I must train in a manner that adds another check much later in the landing sequence. I do perform GUMP checks on every landing and did so in this event. But still the undercarriage got missed.",,,,"C210 pilot reports landing gear up after a three hour flight at high altitude using oxygen.

In my first two stops the company had local mechanics address the problem which was found to be air leaking into a fitting. After having the system worked on at my second location I ground tested it; checking both the spray bar and that all wing and tail panels were properly expelling fluid. After taking off I head for the previous station again; I started to receive a low pressure indication on main pump #1 in the climb at approximately 5;000 FT MSL. I then requested a climb to 9;000 MSL where I knew I would be out of the icing conditions and have an OAT above freezing; to shed what ice I had already accumulated. After leveling off I was troubleshooting the TKS system and managed to get good fluid flow using main pump #2. However within 2 or 3 minutes I was receiving a low pressure indication again and no fluid was coming out the wing panels. ATC cleared me to 6;000 FT but I asked to stay at 9;000 for as long as possible while I tried to get the system back on-line. I conferred with another company pilot over air-to-air frequency but could not get the anti-ice system working again. When it became evident I would have to make a descent and approach through the icing conditions with no ice protection; I declared an emergency with Center. I requested vectors for the ILS 14 but to remain at 9;000 FT until intercepting the localizer at which point I planned a rapid high-speed descent through the cloud layer (ceilings were reported at 1;900 AGL and 4 miles visibility). ATC turned me onto final at 11 miles from the LOC 14 FAF at which point I held a 1;500 - 2;000 FPM descent and caught the glideslope at the FAF. I broke out of the clouds at 4;000 MSL and made a circle to land approach to Runway 32. When I broke out of the clouds I could see visibility over the airport was worse than reported; only one mile or less in heavy snow. I was able to land on Runway 32 with no incident. I believe my decision to land at the scheduled airport despite the descent through icing conditions to be the correct one since there were no practical alternates within my practical fuel range reporting conditions that would allow me to descend without encountering icing conditions.",,,,"A C210's TKS anti-ice system failed in flight after prior maintenance for a similar condition.

Several attempts were made to establish communication with [the] aircraft including using the PET-2000 tuned to 121.5. For a brief period the aircraft was calling on that frequency; but had a stuck mic and was unable to hear any transmissions. At this time the Supervisor came over to my scope to help deal with the situation [and] we noticed the aircraft's mode C was no longer reporting an altitude. The aircraft was about to leave my airspace and enter West RADAR's airspace; who had already taken the hand off prior to it going NORDO. [However]; without a valid mode-C and seeing the aircraft begin turning southbound; we immediately stopped departures at ZZZ and ZZZ1 not knowing the aircraft's intentions. I also vectored aircraft Y away from this aircraft not knowing what altitude it was at. After approximately 3 minutes the aircraft began squawking emergency and very shortly after that the aircraft's transponder quit working; suggesting they had an electrical failure. We were able to track aircraft X with primary RADAR the entire time. As the aircraft started approaching ZZZ1; I was instructed by my Supervisor to attempt to have aircraft Y fly in close proximity to aircraft X in hopes he would see the aircraft and motion to the pilot to land at ZZZ1. I was hesitant to do this not knowing what the other aircraft would do or what altitude he was at; but the Supervisor was standing there watching the entire process and instructing me. The pilot never was able to see the other aircraft and I am not sure if separation was ever lost due to lack of communication and no mode C. Horizontal separation was approximately 1 mile; vertical separation unknown. As the aircraft neared ZZZ1 the Tower was able to see it and said it appeared to be lining up to land on Runway XX; however Runway YY was the active. The aircraft was still circling southwest of ZZZ1 and the Tower told me to bring aircraft Y in for Runway YY. I advised ZZZ1 that aircraft X was IFR and asked if they could provide visual separation with aircraft Y if it were to continue to Runway XX and they said they would. I then cleared aircraft Y for a visual approach to Runway YY; gave him one last traffic report; and shipped him to ZZZ1 Tower. Both aircraft continued to the airport on converging courses and arrived at opposite ends of the runway at almost the exact [same] time. ZZZ1 sent aircraft X around and I instructed them to send him westbound and that I would re-sequence the aircraft after another jet that was lining up for the runway. Weather at the time was VFR and using NORDO procedures aircraft X did exactly what was expected by continuing VFR to the nearest airport and landing. However; I am not sure having another GA aircraft attempt to fly in close proximity to another aircraft when its intentions and altitude are unknown is ever a good idea. Recommendation; if a similar situation were to occur; there should be more thought about keeping aircraft vectored away from the NORDO aircraft and not attempt to intercept the aircraft; especially with another GA aircraft.",,,,"TRACON Controller described an event when an IFR aircraft first indicated a loss of communications followed by an emergency squawk; the reporter voicing concern regarding the supervisors decision to use another VFR aircraft to fly along side of the emergency aircraft to secure information if possible.",

Of course; we also did not have access to TAFs or any forecast products; so we did not know if the weather would improve to visual conditions if he lost his battery. I had the R-side query the pilot about doing and instrument approach at ZZZ1 instead of waiting and he agreed. I had my trainee get control from Approach and we diverted the aircraft on a heading to ZZZ1 for the ILS to Runway 4. After listening to the pilot; I had a feeling he did not have instrument approach charts; so I had the R-side ask the pilot and he said no. We already had the plate pulled up. The R-side gave the pilot the ATIS frequency and told him to get Delta. He came back with it and I then told the R-side to give him the final approach course heading; intercept altitude; and minimums. We had a jet to vector in front of the aircraft and got him on the ILS; then turned aircraft X on behind him. I watched as the aircraft flew through the localizer and informed the R-side. The R-side informed the aircraft of his deviation and he issued a 010 heading to join. The aircraft was responsive and took the heading; but I asked the R-side to see if he is receiving a localizer indication. The pilot said he was not. I called the Tower and informed ZZZ1 Tower what was going on when they gave me the down time on the jet. The Tower told me the jet broke out at 700 FT and the visibility under the clouds was unlimited. I informed the R-side and he was setting up the scope at R13; with quick look to give us a closer view of the localizer and put it on a 25 mile range. The R-side gave the aircraft a 044 heading; which is the final approach course as he was joining the LOC from the south. The pilot started to descend and the R-Side asked him again if he was receiving the localizer. We did not get a chance to ask if he was receiving the glide slope. He started down and when I saw him out of 1;600 FT; I called the Tower and asked if we could bring the aircraft inside the class D. He said approved. I went over to the R13 scope and drew an extended final line to the runway. We depict the runways for this airport and our RADAR is certified to 300 FT off the end of the runway and our transmitter is on the airport. I saw the wind was pushing the aircraft to the south; and told the R-side to give him a 030 heading. That heading seemed to put him right on center line and aimed at the end of the Runway 4. I told the R-side to inform the pilot he could descend to the minimums for the localizer of 600 FT. Our MIA in the area is 2;000 FT; but we are allowed to vector departures out of 800 because we depict the 635 FT tower northeast of the field. I know this was illegal to assign 600 FT; but he was on center line; with power failing; and instrumentation not working; I did not want to see if another approach would work. He was descending on his own anyway. When the aircraft was out of 1;000 FT I asked the R-Side if I could talk to the pilot. I am a CFI and current with flying ASR and PAR approaches. He said go a head. I told the aircraft he was 4 miles from touchdown; 1/4 miles south of the localizer; tracking towards the end of the runway. At that point he broke out [at] 700 FT and said he had the airport in sight. I called the Tower and asked if he wanted us to clear the aircraft to land; not wanting to loose the pilot in a frequency change close to the ground; and the Tower approved. I told the RADAR Controller to relay the landing clearance and switch him to Tower. He did and the pilot had a hard time getting the frequency correct. We watched him on short final and then go around at 400 FT; 150 FT above the runway. The Tower called and said that he was going around to make sure his gear was down. We watched him circle and then land safely. The Tower called and reported the airport was VFR. We did not know what the ceiling was; but around 1;100 FT. I went back later to train on the D-side again and saw the pilot depart for ZZZ. I spoke to him and he said he had a broken wire on the alternator and ran out of power on short final; which is why he went around the pattern to make sure it was down. I asked if he ever got the localizer or glide slope and he said he did only a couple miles out after we got him down to get the airport insight. He was appreciative. Recommendation; I am working with the facility to develop Approach Control training. I spoke to the pilot when he departed later and he said he lost power on short final. If the pilot would have continued on; I would be very afraid to know what would have happened if he lost power while stuck at 7;000 FT on top of a solid overcast and thunderstorms around; with no navigation equipment to get down. I think our action to divert the aircraft was correct and timely. I know we should have declared the emergency to the Supervisor; but it was tough knowing when he would run out of power. The safest and most procedurally correct course of action would have been a missed approach. Not knowing how much power he had left and the report of unlimited visibility under the clouds lead me to make the decision to get him in on a modified ASR. Luckily; we have the extra scope that we can setup to monitor the approaches on a close range. I think our team work helped change a possibly dangerous situation into a favorable outcome.",,,,"Enroute Controller described a hastily arranged ASR type approach to an airport for an aircraft with electrical problems; the reporter indicating all applicable rules may not have been followed during this event but the outcome was successful.",

I had taken the RADAR hand off on the aircraft and was talking to him. When he was approximately 10 NM south of my airspace; northbound; reported picking up rime ice requesting lower. I coordinated with the Controller of the sector he was in for lower and told him to descend and maintain 5;000 FT and to say flight conditions reaching. Reaching 5;000 FT he said he was picking up severe icing and needed to get lower. I told him to descend and maintain 4;000 FT and asked if he wanted to divert. He said he wanted to and I cleared him to ZZZ airport and put him on a vector to intercept the ILS approach. I also told him that there was a satellite airport (ZZZ1) approximately 5 miles northeast of his position that he could divert to as well if necessary. He said that he wanted to go there and I then cleared him and put him on a vector for the VOR approach. The ZZZ1 LOC approach was out of service. On the 300 assigned heading he appeared to be turning eastbound and I advised him as such and reiterated to fly the 300 heading. He was descending below 4;000 FT and I told him to maintain 3;700 FT (which was my lowest MVA). He descended to 3;400 FT and I told him that his altitude was indicating 3;400 FT and to maintain 3;700 FT. He said he was having difficulty and I asked if he was declaring an emergency. He said no and said that he saw a hole and wanted to descend down through it. I asked if he was declaring an emergency and he said no. Being that he was unable to maintain altitude and fly assigned headings while still on an IFR flight plan I told him I was declaring an emergency for him and altitude was his discretion. I advised the pilot of obstacles nearby and shortly after he said he was in VFR conditions and wanted to cancel his IFR flight plan and continue northwest bound toward his destination of ZZZ2. I asked his flight conditions and requested VFR altitude and he said the bases were around 2;000 FT MSL and that he would proceed northwest bound at approximately 1;500 FT. I advised him of terrain higher than his reported cloud bases and suggested that he land at a nearby satellite airport. He agreed and I suggested a vector to ZZZ1 airport. He said he could not continue eastbound because the clouds were too close to the terrain. I asked him if he saw the river below. He said he did and I told him he should follow that northeast bound and it would lead him to another satellite airport adjacent to the river. I kept pointing out obstacles along his flight path along the river and terminated his RADAR service approximately 5 miles from the satellite airport (ZZZ3). I monitored his VFR tag until it flew past ZZZ3 northbound approximately 4 miles and called him on the ZZZ3 UNICOM. I told him to contact Approach on my frequency. When he came up on my frequency I told him it appeared he flew past ZZZ3 airport. He replied yes and that he had decided to continue on; northwest bound; along the river to see how far he could get. I asked if he wanted any additional services and he said no. Recommendation; I think a better understanding of the winter weather conditions along the proposed route of flight and deicing equipment would have helped this pilot more. I also think that a willingness to land and wait out the weather rather than pressing on when conditions are poor would have also helped.",,,,"Approach Controller details an account of the attempts to assist an IFR aircraft experiencing icing condition only to discover the aircraft elected to continue VFR to the original destination in questionable weather conditions.",

Upon arrival (same flight); winds were reported at 250/12 in the ATIS. I requested the runway with more direct wind for landing. Upon landing; the winds seemed much stronger and were quite gusty. I had been up for 18 hours upon landing; having come in from China/Alaska the night before and [my] body hadn't adjusted to time change. I bounced on initial contact with the runway heading straight. Rather than executing a go-around which is a great idea in a Cessna 195 bounced landing recovery; I added a little power and attempted to get the mains on the ground in a wheel landing. I pushed slightly forward to pin the gear and bounced again prior to touching down for the third time with a slight drift due to a gust of wind. At that point; the aircraft started to veer left so I corrected. When corrected; a gust of wind hit the upwind wing and drove the downwind wing into the runway scraping the tip. I recovered the wing low attitude; but was weathervaning into the wind in a small skid while trying to bring the aircraft to a stop. While trying to bring the aircraft to a stop; we departed the runway onto a taxiway and came to a complete stop between two taxiway lights on the edge of the taxiway.

When none was forthcoming; I queried the Controller; who then told me that they do not provide a release when a void-time clearance is given; even though they have established clear and continuous radio communications. This is a bit confusing; since usually a void-time clearance is given only when there is not any good radio communication with you on the ground (and usually obtained by telephone). Another confusing issue was that after contacting Departure after takeoff; I expected to be told to proceed on course; on my own navigation; but that was not forthcoming. Again; I queried the Controller and was told that being cleared 'as filed' meant that I could proceed on course at will; implying that when to turn; and therefore my ultimate track to my destination would be up to me. I'm so accustomed to operating out of towered airports and receiving vectors that his statement that I should assume it was all up to me and my choice as to when to turn was not initially clear to me. Finally; when I proceeded on my own navigation on a track that would avoid a 24/7 (continuous) restricted area; the Controller said that since I was on IFR; I could fly through it; and therefore I should have been flying an exact direct line to my destination.

I asked to level at 7;000 FT to assess the issue. I was able to reset the alternator and continue on; however; the low voltage appeared again; so I began reducing the draw on the alternator by turning off one radio; the ventilation fan; the strobe lights; the autopilot and the PFD. I also requested that I be able to turn off the transponder; but center said I could only do that for 5 minutes; so I decided to leave it on since I believed that it drew very low voltage. I was able to reset the alternator; but requested that I divert to a nearby airport where I could have the intermittent problem assessed by a Mechanic. I chose that airport because it had good repair facilities and the alternator that had been replaced three weeks earlier had come from an overhaul facility in that city. The airport was reporting IFR when I arrived and I was told to expect an RNAV XX approach. I loaded the RNAV XX approach with the expectation that I would get vectors to the approach. When I was handed off to the Tower they gave me a direct route to the initial approach fix for the RNAV XX approach. I didn't understand the name of the fix and ask the Controller for the name; so I could add it to the flight plan. While reprogramming the approach I descended below the request minimum 3;000 FT altitude until reaching the initial fix; so I began climbing back to that altitude. I lowered my gear and turned on the PFD and autopilot and the low voltage light appeared again. At this point I decide to ignore it since I had no indication of a low battery. While on final approach the Tower asked me to report the base of the clouds which I did when I broke out at 1;500 FT. As I tracked inbound to Runway XX I was high on the approach and did not think I could make a landing on Runway XX without an excessive rate of descent so I requested a circling approach. The Controller cleared me for a circling approach to Runway YY and shortly afterward asks that I turn to a southerly heading. As I proceeded south I lost contact with Runway YY when looking east but could see it when I looked west. I was concerned that I would lose view of the airport as required in a circling approach; so I turned back to the west and proceed on a heading of YY; which lined me up for a landing on Runway ZZ. At some point I asked the Controller if he wanted me on a right base to ZZ; but did not receive a response. I proceed on a downwind right base to Runway ZZ and landed. After requesting that I turn to a southerly heading there were no more communications from the Controller until I was on the runway and he requested that I contact Ground Control for taxi instructions. Frankly; I was surprised that the Controller didn't ask me to come to the Tower to discuss my decision to land on Runway ZZ versus Runway YY; but I thought that he must have determined that I had done what I thought was the right thing to do land safely. After landing; I asked to turn right on Taxiway Hotel to discuss FBO option available to me. I then taxied to the FBO. I tried to reset the alternator and it would not reset; so I shut the plane down; turned everything off and restarted to see if the alternator would come back on line; which it didn't. After some work by the maintenance shop; they determined that the voltage regulator had failed; and it was replaced and all ground run-ups resulted in satisfactory operation of the charging system. They thought that maybe having to reset the voltage regulator a number of times caused it to fail completely when I added a heavy load when landing. However; on departure I experienced a problem similar to the prior problem and returned to the airport for further review. They did more work and determined that there was also an intermittent problem with the alternator which was verified by the overhaul shop. The alternator was replaced and all ground run-ups resulted in satisfactory operation of the charging system. However; on departure the problem still existed and the maintenance shop is continuing to work on the problem. In talking with a number of maintenance people around the country; it appears that there is a quality problem with alternators these days; with several people saying they have had to install 2 or 3 alternators before getting one that works properly. Some have also said the same about voltage regulators. The voltage regulator was replaced again today and ground checks have been satisfactory but we are waiting on improved weather to test fly the plane. I think that the above comments cover the chain of events. The major human performance considerations relate to my preparation for and work load during the instrument approach. I should have reduced my work load by either asking for radar vectors to the approach; since that is the procedure I had loaded; or asking what initial fix to expect when I was told to expect an RNAV XX approach. Having to reprogram the approach distracted my attention to altitude control and delayed my restarting the autopilot and PFD; which in turn distracted my attention in managing my final descent rate; resulting in a high missed approach and request to circle for the approach. Not expecting to have to circle to Runway YY; I had not given adequate consideration to the flight pattern that I should expect from the Controller and when I lost sight of the approach end of Runway YY I decided the safest way to maintain visual contact with the runway environment was to turn to a heading of YY and land on Runway ZZ. In short; my planning and work load during the approach led to me getting behind on executing the several details of the approach and landing but the approach and landing was controlled and safely executed. After dealing with the maintenance problem for two days I finally had a chance to think through the events and called the Tower to discuss what had happened. The Controller who was on duty during my approach was not available but I reviewed the events with another senior Controller and he said that while the controllers always want the pilots to follow their instructions; that the pilot ultimately has to do what he thinks is the safest; and the controllers will monitor the flight and provide advice if they think there is a problem. He also said that he thought that if the Controller had thought there was a problem he would have contacted me in the air or on the ground after landing. While this is some consolation that I did the right thing in following a safe course of action; it is still disappointing that my planning for the approach and potential alternatives for dealing with a missed or circling approach were not sufficient to enable me to comply with the Controller's instructions. Lessons learned; or reinforced; thoroughly plan ahead; consider all possible endings on the approach and initiate actions early so that you can stay ahead of the flight as it proceeds.",,,,"A C210 pilot diverted because of a low voltage alert after takeoff and executed a go-around following an IMC RNAV approach because he was not stabilized.

Pilot was unable to restart engine and declared an emergency with ATC and then with the tower; but soon determined the airport was not possible and landed on a nearby freeway.  The right rear main tire contacted and broke rear window of a car; but otherwise plane landed safely with no other damage or injuries.  Upon inspection; the left tank had no remaining usable fuel.  Pilot likely could have restarted the engine by switching to right tank; but did not do so.

Flight profile of failed flight was atypical at 80% power with 25 gallons per hour fuel consumption for engine break in.  The primary cause of the incident was the pilot's focus on engine instrumentation without properly considering and acting on fuel consumption implications.

I continued to climb and was going through 6;500 FT to my target of 11;000 FT when Denver called RADAR contact and instructed me to turn 'North' and remain VFR. I started my turn but stopped at a heading of 090 when the traffic page on my TIS display indicated 2 targets within 2 NM; one at 7;000 and another near that altitude; both north of my track. I was at about 7;000 FT at the time and so executed an immediate descent down to about 6;000 FT when Denver told me to fly a heading of 060; now at the lower altitude; I looked in that direction and that heading would have taken me right into two radio towers which are listed at 6;249 FT about 2 miles away or less (I could see the guide wires). Fortunately I was head out of the cockpit at the time (still not cleared IFR or into the Class B). Denver told me to maintain VFR and fly the heading when able. Once clear of the towers I was given a climb to 8;000 FT and a good vector at which point I got a frequency change and my clearance. The rest of the flight was uneventful.Lessons learned: get my IFR clearance on the ground; even when the weather is VFR and there is VFR traffic at the departure airport. As always don't trust ATC to keep aircraft away from terrain; or clear of other VFR traffic; even when in a high density terminal environment. Safety Concern: Denver ATC on this occasion gave me specific direction; vectors north; which would have put me in direct conflict with 2 other aircraft within 1-2 miles; and then later into radio towers; all of which were certainly depicted on their displays. Since the traffic information I received in my cockpit; including traffic from the TIS; came from ATC I know they had the same information. I also know that significant obstacles are depicted; such as these towers. Alternative ATC actions: ATC could have given me my code; and said 'stay clear of the Class B'; or fly direct AKO the next fix in my flight plan which would have kept me clear of the Class B and the traffic; or any number of other options including clearance into the Class B. My sense was that the Controller attempted to keep me away from DEN but wasn't using all his tools; and made a mistake in the privatization by directing me into a greater threat. Further the shape of the Class B with a transition from a floor of 10;000 to 8;000 coincident with the towers at 6;249 might be a contributing factor; jamming aircraft below 8;000.",,,,"C210 departure from LMO; filed IFR but electing to depart VFR; voiced concern regarding ATC handling; claiming potential conflicts with aircraft and terrain because of ATC directions.",

Aircraft X was Westbound in our sector at 140 from ILC-KROST-MVA and landing RNO. Just East of Krost; Aircraft X requested a routing change direct OAL YERIN RNO due to weather he was looking at over MVA. At this point; the sector frequency was very congested due to bad rides at higher altitudes. As the trainer and due to frequency congestion; I took over communication of Aircraft X. Since we were having Westbound high altitude traffic deviating North of OAL; I explained to Aircraft X that there was weather over OAL and that a heading of about 260 to go between MVA and OAL looked to be the best option. The pilot agreed. I assigned heading 260 to Aircraft X. A few moments later; Aircraft X said there was weather right ahead and that the heading of 260 might not work. I cleared Aircraft X to deviate right or left and to maintain 140. As we were handing off the aircraft to ZOA46; Aircraft X requested descent to 120. We took the hand off back and the D-Side coordinated this descent with ZOA. The D-Side said that ZOA46 denied this descent because of what I thought was an MIA of 140 just North of the aircraft's track and on the ZLC/ZOA boundary because Aircraft X had approval to deviate North. I asked the D-Side to ask ZOA if we assigned Aircraft X a heading to stay South of that 140 MIA; would they approve the descent to 120. After coordination; I was told descent approved. I assigned a heading of 255 or South to Aircraft X and issued descent to 120. When Aircraft X began descent; we got an MSAW alert of 139. The 139 MIA that the aircraft was transitioning is depicted very poorly on both the RADAR scope; MIA polygons and on the overhead charts. On the overhead chart; the 139 MIA is depicted well North of the sector boundary between ZLC Sectors 47 and 43 and on the scope; the 139 altitude is depicted North of the Sector 47/43 boundary. There is also a sliver of 130 MIA airspace adjacent to this 139 MIA on the East side; which is misleading. Also; the red center/sector boundary lines on the overhead charts separate multiple MIA polygons; which visually misleads with a sector boundary line running through the center of this particular MIA.

While observing these two issues; the remaining avionics system shutdown and the airplane lost all electrical power. The engine operated normally. The weather was VMC in Class B airspace; thus I determined to exit Class B and return to my departure airport. The time required for descent and return allowed for execution of emergency checklists in an unhurried manner. These were accomplished without issue. The procedures did not resolve the electrical malfunction; but did get the gear manually extended. Circling east of my destination allowed for completion of the checklists and entry into the traffic pattern downwind leg.

I was given vectors to the GPS A approach and while on the approach I was monitoring the UNICOM frequency at Linden. While [I was] executing the approach the Controller asked me if I could do the visual and if I new the cancellation procedures for Linden. He told me that if I did the full approach traffic into and out of Newark would need to be stopped. That surprised me as I had no idea (nor can I find any information that states that occurs). He briefed me on the cancellation procedure which needed to be done prior to BAUTZ. When I got to BAUTZ I canceled and saw the airport. During this discussing I remained above the approach angle but was low enough to safely make the approach. I canceled and announced my intentions on the UNICOM to land Runway 9. I did not hear any response and continued. On final a plane announced it was on final to Runway 27. I did see it and at about 200 FT executed missed approach and entered a downwind to 27. I landed uneventfully and there was no issue.I felt the lack of information available stating issues with Newark's traffic causes a lot of discussion and may have diverted my attention from listening to traffic in the pattern at Linden. Upon landing I spoke with the landing aircraft pilot who stated that these issues are not entirely uncommon especially with pilots who's native language is not English as well as when there is a lot of traffic to watch. I also called the New York TRACON and spoke to a Controller who explained to me the need to protect the missed approach procedure for IFR traffic landing Linden. I think in visual conditions it should be mentioned that the IFR procedure may not be advised. This is very busy airspace and if a procedure is going to affect major traffic it should be easily seen on a chart. I could not find it.

About that time the Tower called and asked if we were going to be OK as they saw a trail of very heavy black smoke that appeared to be coming from the right engine. I tried using the mixture but that did not work and finally thought to turn off the fuel pump. As soon as the fuel pump was OFF the right engine was normal. I determined that the electric fuel pump had somehow switched itself to high mode and flooded the engine. The altitude deviation occurred while I was trouble shooting the fuel pump issue and testing the fuel pump in different modes during the climb. I was cleared to 5;000 FT and while I was working with the fuel pump I received a call asking me to descend back to 5;000 FT. When I looked at the altimeter I realized that I was climbing through 5;300 FT at that time and immediately descended back to 5;000 FT.

We later discovered that half of our orbit was inside the Class B airspace and the other half of the orbit was clear of controlled airspace. After departing the primary airport; and being given a heading to turn southbound; Tower handed us to TRACON. We had climbed to 4;500 FT MSL before we had an opportunity to check in with TRACON and advised TRACON that we were at 4;500 FT and requesting direct to the scene (approximately 15 miles southeast of our current position). TRACON advised we were clear of the Bravo and to squawk 1200. Approximately 10 miles west of ZZZ we contacted ZZZ Tower and advised we were at 4;500 FT and would be over their airspace (top of ZZZ Class D airspace is 3;000) and were calling as a courtesy. After approximately 10 minutes; ZZZ Tower asked if we were still monitoring their frequency and to call TRACON. We did so and TRACON advised that we had been flying into and out of a slice of the Class B airspace based on our altitude of 4;500 FT. The section of airspace that we were clear of became controlled at 5;000 FT (the airspace we were in after being instructed to squawk 1200 after our initial call to TRACON after departing.) Of note: We use commercially available geo-referenced iPad software to show aircraft position over an electronic sectional chart. Before departing; a direct route was plotted from our hangar to ZZZ. The software displayed a solid magenta line. That magenta line showing the direct course; aligned perfectly with the Class B airspace boundary that marked the Class B floor change from 5;000 FT MSL to 4;500 FT [4;000] MSL. This magenta line obscured the Class B boundary line that we ended up flying over during our orbit(s). After contacting TRACON; we asked for and received a squawk and clearance; and remained on scene until released by ground officers. Continued vigilance of airspace altitude changes; with respect to locating our ground target (visually) is required to prevent a repeat occurrence. Asking TRACON for continued flight following; instead of accepting their request to squawk 1200 during the initial call to TRACON and not plotting a direct course that obscured the airspace boundary would have aided in preventing this occurrence.",,,,"C210 pilot reports inadvertently orbiting in and out of Class B airspace on a law enforcement mission.

The main gear came out and dropped down but did not rotate forward into the down and locked position. The nose gear was out.I extended the downwind and recycled the gear. The mains fully retracted but on extension only came out partially again. I then retracted gear and went to manual extension. Manual pump with power pack off would pump nose gear out only; mains remained in the plane. I tried this manual procedure 5 more times and called a mechanic on the field who advised that fluid might be out of the hydraulic unit. I climbed to 4;000 FT; set auto pilot and climbed back to the luggage compartment to get a quart of engine oil. Pulled open the access panel and attempted to add oil with a flashlight but the power unit was almost full. I then retracted the gear completely and tried the hand pump three more times with the same result. Finally I tried unusual attitudes to try and swing gear forward into locked position with no luck.I then planned for a partial gear landing and had ground personnel call the Fire Department and warn off any approaching planes and circled in slow flight for 10 more minutes waiting for trucks to arrive. On a half mile final with full flaps I turned off the engine and closed the fuel selector with approximately four gallons of remaining fuel.

Preparing to land; I lowered the landing gear. The gear came down; but the green light did not illuminate. I recycled the gear several times. Each time the gear came down; but the green light did not come on. I observed directly the left gear in its normal and proper place. By looking at a mirror on the left wing I could also see the nose and right gear. They also seemed to be properly in place. I double checked the circuit breakers which were all properly in place. I opted to fly the missed and explained to tower I was concerned about the gear. They asked me to maintain 2;300 MSL and fly the runway heading so they could visually inspect the gear. Tower said the gear appeared to be properly in place. They asked me to fly a right downwind to Runway 32 so they could also observe the gear from the other side. I did so. They again confirmed the gear appeared to be down and in proper position. On a previous flight the lens of the gear light was twisted so the light was not visible. I thought there may be a similar problem this time; but upon twisting the light I could get it to illuminate but not stay on. Because I was able to visually see the gear down and the gear appeared in proper position and because the Tower stated the gear were down and appeared to be in the proper position; I elected to land and assumed the gear light was faulty. I landed very gently and two main tires touched the ground. I kept the nose high as I slowed. The right side began to feel mushy and it soon became apparent the right gear was collapsing. By this point; the forward speed was slow and I attempted to keep the wings level. However; I was unable to maintain directional control as the airplane began veering to the right. The airplane ran about 10 feet off the right side of the runway and gently came to a stop. The propeller and wings never struck the ground; but the right elevator gently scraped the ground as the plane came to rest. I was uninjured and the only damage to the airplane appears to be minor scraping on the outer edge of the right elevator and some balding of the right tire.

C210 was sequenced to follow a C172 on base for Runway 35L and then cleared to land. At that point I turned to watch the Local Control 2 Controller. A little while later I heard the Local Control 1 Controller initiate a go around with C210 and then 5-10 seconds later I heard him re issue the go around instruction multiple times and then instruct the aircraft on the runway C172 to start departure roll. During these transmissions C210 reported 'bingo fuel' which I believe meant he was low on fuel; he then reported the C172 in sight and continued to land despite the instructions of the Local Control 1 Controller. As C210 landed; I would estimate the lateral distance between C210 and the C172 on departure roll to be 500-800 FT with both aircraft on the runway simultaneously. When C210 touched down he applied braking power and appeared to be turning off the runway at A3. A short time later I observed C210 with a stalled engine stopped on the runway and it also appeared he had a flat tire I then called the Local FBO and they brought out a tug to pull him into the apron. The aircraft was removed from the runway and normal operations resumed. I believe this event happened as a result of the pilot of C210 not advising the Tower of his fuel situation on initial contact. The Local Control 1 Controller sequenced C210 to follow the C172 in a timely manner. The Local Control 1 Controller also issued a go-around with adequate time and altitude for C210 to initiate a go-around safely and in a timely manner. If C210 would have made any statement about his fuel situation after the initial go around instruction the Local Controller could have cancelled the departure clearance of C172 and turned him off the runway or told the C172 to start takeoff roll to ensure the separation would be adequate for C210 arrival. C210 in my opinion ignored the instructions of the Local Control 1 Controller because he was low on fuel and didn't want to admit it and created a very dangerous situation.

When I checked progress of Aircraft on the RACD; it was rapidly approaching from the West; range approximately one mile indicating same altitude. In the initial contact; pilot stated that he had a (Cessna) in front of or between him and the airport. I had no time to issue traffic as the aircraft were already together. I issued landing clearance to aircraft and asked if Approach had issued the traffic. The pilot replied in the negative. ZZZ1 Tower called advising that one of their pilots said something about a close call. I could not make out clearly the full gist of what ZZZ1 Tower was trying to tell me. I called the FBO and requested they have the pilot of Aircraft X call me in the Tower. When the pilot called; we discussed whether the incident warranted the filing of a NMAC report and the decision was made to file. The pilot also indicated that he thought training was in progress on Approach Control. In speaking with ZZZ1 Tower; it was determined that the other aircraft involved was Aircraft Y; a C172; and that the pilot seemed 'shaken'. Shortly after; my Tower Manager told me that since both aircraft were operating visually that there was no NMAC. That appears to be a personal interpretation. Although the AIM mentions a definitive 500-foot proximity in this definition; it goes on to allow the pilot; or flight crew member; to make a determination as to if a collision hazard existed regardless of how close the aircraft came to one another.

I only do this in late summer and in daytime as the Cessna T210N is a single engine light aircraft. I filed for 11;000 FT and way points that would keep me clear of the Class B outer ring centered on ORD. My goal is to climb as fast as possible to have glide range in the event of an issue. If I file a lakefront route; Chicago Approach vectors me far to the west adding 40 minutes or more to my flight time; as compared with a Victor airway lakefront routing (I've tried and they won't grant). On this flight they restricted me to 4;000 FT. I asked Chicago Approach I was told I could not climb due to O'hare traffic. I have TIS and saw no traffic at all the entire episode within 12 NM and +/- 3;000 FT. When I was switched to Chicago Center I asked again and got the climb but a vector which extended my time over water significantly. There should be a reasonable method to allow small aircraft to cross the minimum distance and climb quickly over the water so as to minimize the risks. I think this is a policy issue more than any ATC conflict rules. Whether a lake crossing; or a trip on the Victor airways across the lakefront or a trip around the west of Chicago; under IFR the controllers vector me way out of the way; increasing risk. If I were to cancel; or fly VFR (outside of the Class B or under); I could fly any route I choose; not participate in the flow; and fly the safest route. It makes no sense that by filing IFR I am put at much higher risk; whereas if I fly VFR I reduce my risk but put other aircraft at risk; and push the controllers to keep IFR aircraft clear of me. Chicago TRACON should adopt a lakefront IFR corridor for small aircraft; a West IFR corridor; and a lakefront overflight corridor that allow safe flight.",,,,"General Aviation pilot expressed concern regarding the ATC procedures used to handle IFR aircraft flying in the vicinity of ORD; indicating IFR handling results in high risk over water flights compared to VFR operations.",

I had asked Tower for radar services and Tower gave me a right turn out and then handed me over to Departure. Departure asked me what altitude I was climbing to and I told them 4;500 FT. I don't remember Departure's exact phraseology but they cleared me on course with a 'Climb and maintain 4;500'. I was never given any radar vectors or told a course to fly. My on course heading was just about straight west. Right after I checked in with Departure; I noticed an aircraft in the distance with a very; very bright recognition light on it. The aircraft was quite a ways above me and did not appear at that time to be moving across my windshield. I always pay special attention to any aircraft that does not appear to be moving in the windshield because I know that means that we are on a converging course. As I kept flying; the other aircraft appeared to be descending and I noticed that their recognition lights appeared to pulse alternately between two lights that I think were close together. Again; these lights were extremely bright and very attention grabbing but it also made it impossible for me to tell the size of the aircraft. I gradually turned a little bit to the southwest; I think probably around 30 degrees to the left of my original course. At this time; the other aircraft appeared to be slowly moving to the right across the copilot side windshield and I then knew that we were not on a converging course. I kept a close eye on the other aircraft. It would have been hard not to have because its recognition light was so bright. I was having a hard time judging distance but it appeared to be well clear of me. I had just leveled at 4;500 FT. I may have gone up an extra 50 FT; but I know I did not get to 4;600 FT. As the other aircraft was going behind me off my right side; I heard the pilot come on the radio and say something about his TCAS giving him a warning and he had to climb. I asked Departure what type of aircraft went behind me and he said it was a B737. I have very little knowledge about TCAS so I don't know what type of warning the other pilot got. I never thought that we were too close together. The only problems I see is that the bright recognition light made it hard for me to judge distance; but I still think that it was better for them to have such a bright light than to not have one.

Similar test conditions to the one that was about to take place today had already been accomplished at lower altitudes (below Class A airspace) without difficulty or the need of an additional flight crewmember. After receiving a weather briefing and completion of my preflight planning; which included a thorough review of the flight test profile; conditions to be tested and other risk mitigation tools used by my company during the course of flight testing; I filed an IFR flight plan using my company's ATC assigned call sign and my company specific test number. Due to the nature of the testing; I added the following comment to my flight plan: 'Need own NAV (navigation) (with) in altitude block 21;000 FT to 19;000 FT (FL210-190) for 40 minutes.' After a through preflight inspection; I started the engine; received the ATIS weather; contacted Clearance Delivery to pick up my IFR clearance and began the flight. The taxi; takeoff and subsequent climb to FL200 were uneventful as expected. In preparation for this series of high altitude flights; I had an additional oxygen bottle installed and had ordered a brand new double seal oxygen mask with built in microphone to ensure that during single pilot operations at high altitude; there would be nothing to distract me from accomplishing the flight test profile as planned. During the climb to altitude; I was assigned vectors by the Center Controller. After leveling off at FL200; I set up for the first test point which required a deceleration from VH (Maximum Airspeed at Maximum Continuous Power) to 1.3 Vs (130% of the flaps up stall speed) and then accelerate back to VH. Since this was supposed to be conducted as a level flight condition; I did not request a 'block altitude' prior to the initiation of the maneuver nor was a block altitude granted by ATC. With airplane's airspeed stable at VH; I reduced the throttle to an intermediate setting and allowed the airplane to decelerate toward 1.3 Vs while maintaining FL200. As the airspeed approached 1.3 Vs; I anticipated the need to increase power by 'leading' the power application so the airspeed did not decelerate below the target value of 1.3 Vs. As I advanced the throttle to increase power; the engine did not respond and there was no increase in engine power output. Since the airspeed was lower than that during 'normal' flight operations; the airplane was unable to maintain altitude and the only safe and prudent decision was to 'sacrifice' altitude to maintain airspeed. I attempted to contact Center Controller to make them aware of the situation but my transmission went without response. I can only speculate that the reason I did not receive a response was that it was probably blocked by transmissions from other aircraft on the same frequency. During the descent to maintain airspeed due to the lack of engine power output (the engine at no time stopped producing power but it did not respond to commanded power increases); I began troubleshooting by adjusting throttle and activating the electric fuel pump with no differing results in engine operations. I assumed I was having a potential fuel system malfunction (possibly fuel vapor) but my number one priority was to maintain positive aircraft control. As I was approaching 18;500 FT (FL185); I was contacted by the Center Controller stating in part that 'he had me at a different altitude than assigned.' I responded to his statement with 'I have no engine response and could not maintain altitude.' The Center Controller asked if I would like to declare an emergency; to which I declined and asked to continue the descent and that I might turn toward the North to make a landing at a nearby airport. After passing through 18;000 FT (FL180) I cancelled my IFR clearance and resumed my own navigation. Upon reaching 17;000 FT; the engine began operating normally and I informed the Center Controller that I would be turning back toward my destination and would be continuing the descent to 10;000 FT. The flight continued without event or further difficulty. In reviewing this event; I realize I should have immediately set my transponder to 7700 and declared an emergency when it was realized I could no longer maintain altitude. This action would have alerted the Center Controller of my situation as soon as possible and allowed him to move other traffic if required. I should have been a better steward of the airspace and made the Controller's job easier by not having him be surprised by an aircraft deviating from clearance. This event was likely a bootstrapping event since the aircraft was operating above the engine's critical altitude (the maximum altitude at which the turbocharger can maintain rated power) and the possibility of such an event should have been discussed before attempting the flight profile.",,,,"A C-210 pilot reported the engine did not fail; but ceased developing power while recovering from a minimum airspeed maneuver on a test flight at FL200.

I made sure that the gas caps were secure on both tanks and continued my pre-flight inspection. Takeoff and en route were normal with no indications of a rough running engine or abnormal full flow. The C210 with full tanks has 90 gallon capacity with 89 gallons usable; or 534 LBS of fuel. I conducted the flight at 7;000 FT and had the fuel leaned out to 102-103 LBS per hour. I was descended to 5;000 FT about this time I began my decent/arrival checks and noticed the I had a critical fuel situation and asked ATC for the nearest airport; very soon after this my engine quit running and I saw an airfield to my southwest and told ATC that I needed that one and that I was declaring a fuel emergency. After the engine quit I performed my emergency flows and backed them up with the emergency checklist.

This hesitation was only present upon initial deflection from the centered position and did not affect any controls aside from the ailerons. Upon instruction from the Tower to contact Departure; I asked the Tower for permission to enter a right downwind and return for landing. When inquired about the nature of my return; I stated the aircraft flight controls were 'sticking.' I believe an emergency was declared on my behalf and I was cleared to land on the same runway previously departed from. I used minimum control deflection needed to execute a normal approach and landing where I was followed back to the local FBO by emergency vehicles. Outside temperature was slightly below freezing. Aircraft was placed in a hangar for approximately one hour fifteen minutes prior to flight. Problem was only discovered upon initial climb. No abnormalities were discovered during pre-flight; aileron deflection during taxi or full control manipulation after run-up prior to takeoff. Aircraft was placed in a hangar for the remainder of that day in addition to another day. Flight controls were tested again after a period of approximately 36 hours with no abnormalities detected. Later; an A&P Mechanic was also consulted regarding the abnormality. I believe that despite a thorough pre-flight inspection along with a visual and tactile inspection of the aircraft fuselage and control surfaces; residual water migrated to the control cables or pulleys. This water was not detected until the aircraft reached an altitude more conducive for freezing. As the residual water began to freeze on the controls; a 'sticking' or hesitation manifested when trying to deflect the ailerons from the centered position. This theory was deemed likely by an A&P Mechanic. I will remain vigilant about the potential hazards of cold weather operations and continue to educate myself using faasafety.gov in addition to participating in online safety seminars.

During the climb I experienced fuel flow fluctuations and as the flight manual instructs I was running the electric boost pump to stabilize flow. This causes the mixture to be leaned to compensate for excess flow. When I lost electric power the boost pump stopped and the engine subsequently lost power and vapor locked. At that point the engine gyros and electric turn coordinator were both out. The electric came back on as soon as I cycled the main electric switch. With IMC in front of me but open air to my right; I immediately declared an emergency so I could stay visual and circled over an airport in that VMC area to restart. Icing was encountered on my descent but I was able to restart the engine around eight to ten thousand feet MSL by running the boost pump on high to clear the vapor locked engine. At that point I asked for vectors to ZZZ with better approach options. As I got closer heavy rain moved over the airport and I was concerned about making an approach in those conditions. Having a good idea of what caused the engine stoppage and that the engine was running stable; I elected to cancel the emergency and vacate the weather toward VMC conditions. Cruising at a lower altitude to my destination no other issues were noted and all systems were functioning normally. ATC was very helpful and handled the emergency very well. They did voice concern over not landing immediately but I felt it was a safer decision to vacate the thunderstorm area rather than shoot an approach in such conditions.

The autopilot stopped operating. While I was troubleshooting the problem; I noticed that the battery charge was low and falling rapidly. I attempted to notify Approach of the problem and believe that they understood that we had lost our alternator and were about to lose communications. Then we lost communications as our transmitter was too weak. I started turning off avionics and other electrical systems in an attempt to save battery power while troubleshooting the alternator. It did not come back online and I turned off the batter to conserve what power remained. I attempted to make radio contact with an onboard hand-held radio; but either its transmissions were too weak or its battery was too low to transmit effectively. Despite repeated attempts I was never able to use it to communicate. I had a hand-held GPS; an iPad with Foreflight installed and a Stratus ADS-B receiver to use for navigation and weather avoidance.... I determined that to continue along our flight planned route would be hazardous due to thunderstorm avoidance; possible frozen pitot tube and potential conflict with other aircraft around without a transponder. During a break in the IFR conditions I observed clear air to the southeast and turned towards it in order to stay out of the clouds and avoid a frozen pitot tube. I decided to continue in the clear air to the southeast and while I had an opening to descend to a VFR altitude below the cloud bases. Once I got to the east of the line of storms I turned south in excellent VFR conditions paralleling the line of storms. Periodically I flipped the master switch on momentarily to check the charge on the battery. For some reason it seemed to be gaining a little bit of charge. The more time passed; the more charge returned. Because of this I determined that if I continued on to [destination] there was a reasonable chance that the battery would have sufficient power to lower the gear and thus an emergency extension procedure might not be required. I was concerned with lost ATC contact -- they might be worried that we had crashed and/or that they might be clearing traffic anticipating our overflight. With the increased charge on the battery; I decided to try the radio and was able to make contact briefly. I stated our situation; cancelled IFR and explained that while we were likely to lose contact again we were going to continue on to our destination. The Controller was very helpful and asked if we required assistance and mentioned that [an alternate field] was to the east and asked if we wanted land there. Given the VFR flight conditions; the fact that we could navigate VFR around the weather and any airspace; and finally the possible avoidance of an emergency gear extension; I declined to land [there]. I lost contact as the battery charge dropped again. I continued VFR to the southeast around the line of storms. A few minutes out; I slowed the aircraft; turned on the battery and had enough charge to extend the gear. With all other electrical off other than the rotating beacon; one NAV Comm and the transponder squawking VFR; I made radio calls for the pattern and performed a no flaps landing. After I landed I telephoned the FSS in order to make sure that no one was concerned about or looking for us. They confirmed that they had received our IFR cancellation; but were nonetheless glad to know that we arrived safely. In reviewing my decision making for this situation I believe that the decision to get into VFR flight conditions was a good one as well as to use these conditions to navigate around the storms. I might second guess my decision not to land at [an en route alternate]. Although I have practiced the emergency gear extension procedure in the aircraft; if there was a reasonable chance to avoid having to take that step then I believe that given the VFR conditions for continuing the flight I probably made the right decision.",,,,"C210 pilot on an IFR flight plan with only partial electrical power and intermittent communications due to a faulty alternator; maintained VFR and navigated via handheld GPS and iPad to the destination airport.",

I crossed FEGBA at 3;000 and turned to a heading of 343 and was on the course line when I began a descent into the airport after crossing FEGBA; which was reporting 600 OVC. I entered IMC conditions about 2;500 FT and continued my descent toward the FAF NAKHU. I neglected to note that I was below the 2;000 FT MDA at NAKHU until I was nearly over NAKHU; when the GPS flashed a warning that there was terrain ahead. I believe that this happens when an obstruction in the terrain falls within less than 500 vertical FT from the aircraft and I cleared the warning to see where I was on the GPS; since the warning obliterates the navigation screen. It immediately came back on and I noted that not only was I very close to the FAF NAKHU; but I was already below the 2;000 FT MDA. At this point I initiated a missed approach; though I believe I had already crossed over NAKHU; narrowly missing the obstructing hill that is exactly on the course line and actually seems to be a physical location of the FAF. Once I had climbed back up into VFR-ON-TOP conditions I was able to see the northern edge of the low clouds so I was able to cancel both the IFR clearance and the IFR flight plan and circle around and see the runway; where I landed without incident. I don't know how close we actually came to the terrain; but it had to be very close. Though we never saw it and it was only after landing that I reexamined the approach course and looked at the terrain when the clouds lifted the next day I realized how close we had come to becoming one of the crashes that lists 'controlled flight into terrain after dropping below the MDA' as the cause. I am humbled and very grateful that I am still alive to be able to submit this report. The problem arose from my lack of attention to the MDA as well as my own altitude. I was flying a non-precision approach and was in kind of an automatic 'get down to the MDA' as soon as possible in order to make sure I had the best chance of actually seeing the airport. I hadn't really paid enough attention to the approach plate and the MDA of 2;000 FT at the FAF and was flying as if FEGBA was the FAF; when it was actually only the IAF. It wasn't until the terrain warnings popped up on the GPS screen that I realized something was wrong with the approach and took corrective action; nearly too late by then since the altitude listed of the terrain is 1;392 FT and I was already nearly 200 FT below that. I would have plowed into the trees had I been any closer before taking corrective action. Fortunately; I had not yet put the gear down and my forward airspeed was such that a small correction in my attitude resulted in an immediate climb; though I'm not exactly sure if the terrain was ahead of me; under me or behind me when I initiated the climb. Certainly if the local altimeter setting was any different than what I had put in my altimeter I could have been either above or below the actually terrain elevation. As I examined this approach I was puzzled as to why they would put the approach path directly over this obstruction. I realize there are constraints given the actual runway heading; but this is a non-precision approach and it looks to me like the approach architects could have placed the final approach course a few degrees east to put it over water and dictated a turn once the approach end if the runway became visible. This would put the final approach course between two obstructions; one on either side; but somehow; that seems somewhat safer than putting it directly over the highest obstruction. Alternatively; they could have designed another approach from the north which lies entirely over water. I realize there are many constraints to putting in IFR approaches and I'm sure this one had any number of restrictions that forced them toput it where they did; but being unaware of the constraints under which the approach architects operate; it isn't immediately obvious to me.",,,,"A single engine pilot on the ORS RNAV GPS-A approach crossed FEGBA at 3;000 FT and began a descent but descended below 2;000 FT prior to the FAF NAKHU and not until the GPS terrain warning alerted did the pilot realize his error in time to execute a missed approach.",

What happened: Glideslope came alive on ILS; and got STUCK. While my student thought she was flying a perfect glideslope; we were on a collision course for the ground. Background info: This flight was the 300 NM cross country flight required for the commercial rating. We were on our way back to our home base. I am a newly minted CFII. 600 hours TT. I have 100+ hour of actual instrument time from flying a G1000 C208. While I have 40+ hours in the C210 we were flying; I've flown only one or two approaches in it. Similarly; my student had 10+ hours in the airplane; but little recent instrument time. While we both were inclined to scrub the flight and try and come home the next day; it was Spring Break in Key West; and there was NO place left to stay overnight; so we decided to fly home. Though my student lacked much current instrument experience; I was confident in my ability to shoot the ILS. Well; I'm letting my student fly the ILS. We turned inbound... glideslope came alive and moved to 'one dot high.' Student started descending; fast. VSI and altimeter were decreasing. By the time the altimeter reached 600 FT I knew something was wrong. Luckily I had the GPS procedure loaded as well; so I could see our distance from the MAP was still 2+ miles. I grabbed the controls; leveled off. Less than 2 seconds later Tower comes on the radio and tells us they're getting an altitude alert. I leveled off; kept flying; and sure enough the glideslope stayed pegged right where it was; indicating one dot high. I just kept my altitude (600 MSL) because I knew it was above the LOC minimums (480 MSL) and 1 MI from the missed approach point I was about to go around when my student caught the MASLRS. Conclusion: I am thoroughly convinced that almost anyone in this situation could have flown themselves into the ground following a false glideslope indication. For me; typically flying ILS approaches on glass avionics; the idea of the glideslope indicator getting stuck was totally foreign to me. Thankfully I was able to recognize things were not right; but I don't think everyone might have been that lucky. If my student was alone and the ILS was unmonitored; they could have ended up in the trees.","Reporter stated the airport's ILS glideslope was reported out of service earlier in the day but reported functional at the time of this approach.

Upon initial contact I informed Aircraft X of the weather at DCA as the ATIS code for ADW was showing 'SW' on my IDS and the METAR information for ADW had expired. I called ADW Tower to advise them of the inbound and the mistake on the IDS. Aircraft X advised me of a layer at 2;500 feet that was not shown on the ADW ATIS and requested the ILS 19L. Prior to switching Aircraft X to ADW Tower; I called ADW Tower again and asked them to verify the ATIS with Aircraft X on initial contact as 5-6 minutes had passed since my initial call and request to update the ATIS on the IDS and it was still showing 'SW' as the current ATIS.  I reported this issue the OM on duty and asked that he add it to the log. The lackadaisical approach ADW Tower consistently takes to updating both the METAR and ATIS codes on the midst continues to be an ongoing problem. This is my second ATSAP report on the issue in 6 months. ADW Tower called after the fact to inform me that due to the way their weather reporting system is designed; the METAR info was in fact correct and current. The Tower Controller stated that the METAR information pushes to the TRACON every hour on the hour. Hopefully this is the case and I'm just confused.If I am confused about the specific process that takes place at ADW to push weather info to PCT then I am sure I am not the only person. I would recommend a briefing to the MTV area focusing on the specific nuances of the weather reporting process at ADW Tower and how they differ from how weather gets pushed from DCA to PCT. If this is a case of ADW Tower falling behind in updating the weather information; then I would continue to push that they be held accountable to do their job and push the pertinent weather in a timely manner. During the [Stated] crash; 4 people lost their lives and the weather pushed to PCT by ADW was 4+ hours old. Current weather may have made a difference in the outcome. My last ATSAP on the mid shift operations at ADW involved an ATIS and IDS that advertised an approach to a runway closed for maintenance. Tonight's report may be an over reaction based on past experience with ADW Tower but I do believe this report and its outcome are worth the trouble.",,,,"Reporting Controller states there is a problem with the way the Andrews AFB weather gets disseminated.",

From my position above Runway 18 heading south; I decided to circle to land on Runway 7 and noted that to the Controller; who then cleared me to land on Runway 7. All of this would have been fine had I properly climbed to pattern altitude and circled to land. However; in my muddled mental state after a long and difficult 9-hour cross-country trip; I climbed and visually flew what I thought was a reasonable pattern; staying clear of the hill on the southwest side of the field with it's red light on top. However; after turning past that hill; my altitude in fact topped out at 1;200 FT MSL; and instead of going on up to 1;400 or 1;600 MSL for a proper pattern; my altitude in fact gradually decreased. I failed to recognize as I flew into the inky blackness of the valley; and importantly; did not check my altimeter and compare what I saw to what a reasonable pattern altitude ought to be. My head was outside the cockpit and I was operating visually; but with visual cues that were sparse and ultimately of no real value. Soon I was over the Vermont side of the river in darkness; with the town lights off to my right; and dark terrain ahead and below. To cap off my loss of situational awareness; I recall actually saying out loud; 'Now where is that airport?' At about the same time; my son in the back seat exclaimed something that turned out to be about our being really close to the trees. By the time I figured out what he was trying to say; we had already passed over the hilltop that had surprised him (and that I was; incredibly; unaware of.) I commenced a climb in my right turn back toward Runway 7; and was really surprised to see all reds on the PAPI. After that; the final approach to Runway 7 was below a normal glide path but led to an essentially uneventful landing. The shock of how close we came to disaster and how completely unaware I was of the situation has not really worn off. On reviewing recorded data from my GPS MAP 496; I found that my altitude had deteriorated from 1;200 FT MSL down to 875 FT MSL just as I passed over the hill near the quarry across the river in Vermont; where the terrain elevation was 650 FT MSL. Just a little to the left of my flight path was the top of that hill at 700 FT MSL. I was unaware of any of this terrain and frankly unaware of my altitude at this time. Basically I cleared the trees by about 200 FT without even being aware I was close. I have done a lot of night flying and flown into a good number of 'black-hole' airports before. In the past I've always stayed safely above terrain by having a mental model of where I needed to be and at what altitude. This is just basic airmanship. I think the go-around at night with a circle to land after a long trip was something I was not mentally prepared for. I needed to transition from final approach and arrival mode; to night VFR in the pattern; and didn't make that transition properly. That's the sort of thing a pilot has to always be prepared for; and on this particular night I wasn't. I am going to refresh the habit of calculating a pattern altitude for all airports I'm arriving at; and ensuring I don't drop below that floor until I've got the runway in sight in front of me; particularly if it's night and most particularly if I need to circle to land. And I think I'll be doing whatever I reasonably can to avoid circling at night in the first place; especially at the end of a cross-country flight. I thinkit also might have been possible for the Controller on duty to keep an eye out for the potential incompetence of the pilot in this case; and to have issued a low-altitude alert. I'm thinking that if I can make this kind of error; then others might be susceptible to this sort of error as well in the future. Of course; after [Tower closing] nobody would be there to provide additional warnings; but in this case; it might have been possible. On the other hand; from the Tower it may be common to lose sight of aircraft southwest of the airport; given the hill with its red light on the southwest corner of the airfield. But I would suggest all controllers be reminded of the potential dangers of CFIT to aircraft maneuvering around airports with hilly terrain in visual conditions at night; and urged to provide an extra level of security to those flights whenever possible. The aircraft in this incident has essentially original 1978 avionics; except for an enroute GPS. A more modern GPS moving map in the panel such as a 430W / 530W or newer would most likely have issued visual and audible warnings of an impending collision with terrain in this case. Although I have a 496 which also does this; it is not tied into the audio system of the aircraft; and so I can't hear its' audio output -- something I intend to change right away; as a stopgap measure until the time that I am able to proceed with a fuller panel upgrade.",,,,"C210 pilot reports a CFTT during a night circiling approach to Runway 7 after a missed approach from Runway 18 in VMC.",

With no other planes on frequency; I announced my position 10 miles out; northeast of the field descending out of 7;000 intending to enter a downwind to Runway 16. A minute or two later; I heard another plane report 20 miles south; also landing Chester. I thought he said he was a J-3 (Piper Cub); a much slower airplane than mine. Turns out he said CJ-3; which was unfamiliar to me; but is a Citation Jet. Had I known that; I'd have let him land first; but the outcome would likely have been worse had I done so. I then reported 5 miles NE. The CJ-3 then reported his intention to make a straight in to Runway 34; so I decided to turn downwind for 34 so that we'd both be using the same runway to reduce potential confusion to any other planes coming in. I reported turning downwind; but I believe I said; 'Downwind to 16'; my original runway choice. At that point; the CJ-3 reported his intention to circle while I landed. I then reported turning base to 16; but corrected it to Runway 34. I then reported turning final to 34. At just about the point I was about to flare; a plane that had not been talking reported his intention to take off on Runway 16 at Chester. As I looked at the opposite end of the 5;500 foot runway; I could see a plane moving from the run up area towards the departure end of 16. Incredulous; I emphatically repeated my call advising I was '...on short short final landing runway 34 Chester.' The thought of a go-around went through my mind but I decided it would have been more dangerous as the hot day made for a 7;500 foot density altitude; meaning that my plane would likely climb very slowly; and depending on where the other guy lifted off; could potentially put us at the same altitude with a much higher closing rate. A go around would have put us 'low and slow'; near the stall speed (not very maneuverable) while I waited for the gear to retract. Conversely; the long runway (5;500 feet) meant that I could be down and stopped in less than half the runway; and dramatically reduce our closing rate; if he actually took off. As I flared; the other pilot lined up on the runway. As I slowed my plane; I moved to the left half of Runway 34. The other plane; a Cessna 182; then took off on the left half of Runway 16; so apparently he saw me in time to abort his take off; yet decided to take off anyway. He never said another word. The CJ-3 crew tried to get him to give his position so they could avoid him and start their landing approach. He said nothing. They tried to get him to give his tail number but he wouldn't reply. We got his tail number from the man in the FBO where the pilot had just paid for his overnight parking before departing.",,,,"Multiple factors resulted in a breakdown in important CTAF communications at a high altitude airport resulting in the reporter's C-210 landing one direction while a C-182 took off the opposite direction on the same runway.",

I then headed back to my home base and tried multiple times to deploy gear without success. I reread POH and other than hand pumping; there was nothing specified. Center had a Controller who owned a C-210 and he talked me though several scenarios; without improvement. He even called his A&P asking for suggestions. When I got back to base I did a couple more maneuvers in an attempt to get the nose gear down; without success. I then circled Class D airspace and tried to manually pump down the gear; at minimum airspeed. The pump would not pump; signifying that there was adequate hydraulic pressure to bring the gear down; and that it was 'stuck' for some other reason. I reread the POH; and decided there was nothing else I could try. I flew a short while longer; till my fuel was low; and then told ATC I was going to land. They switched me to Tower and I made a long; slow approach to landing; at minimum airspeed; stall horn blaring. Also; the gear warning horn was sounding. I turned the fuel flow to off immediately before touchdown. I touched down at the bottom of the white arc (stall speed) and the nose nearly immediately dropped to the runway; I assume this to be from the very low speed; and lack of lift.

My destination airport was VFR with 1;500 feet broken; 7;000 overcast and 10 miles visibility; OAT of 5 degrees Celsius. Although there was no icing reported at 9;000 feet; I knew it was a possibility and my plan; if I encountered icing; was either to do a 180 back or climb (I had a PIREP of tops at 11;500 feet). I also knew that the entire flight; with a tailwind; would have me in the clouds for maybe 20 minutes. I did not initially pick up any ice at 9;000. About ten minutes into the flight (more than a third of the way to my destination) I began to get some light rime. I had already turned on the pitot heat and heated prop.  Then; about 25 miles out from the destination; the airframe began to pick up ice very quickly. I went from having a light film on the leading edges to maybe 3/4 of an inch in less than ten minutes. I found myself 'between' my planned outs of turning back and climbing--I could have climbed; but I was approaching the destination. I asked ATC for lower; because the OAT was about minus 1 Celsius and I knew that it was above freezing only a thousand feet below my current altitude. Unfortunately; the MVA was 8;500 feet and I needed 8;000. I also knew that 8;000 feet was a 'safe' altitude relative to terrain and obstacles. Even though ATC knew I was iced up and in need of a way out; they could not offer me lower than 8;500 feet. The airplane was still flying OK; albeit 'heavier' and a tiny bit nose high. Indicated Airspeed was still OK and I was watching it closely. Unfortunately; the airframe was still accreting ice and I decided I could no longer wait to descend. I informed approach that I needed an 'emergency descent due to icing.' They acknowledged and immediately allowed 'emergency vectoring altitude down to 7;300 ft.' At 8;300 feet MSL; the ice started melting off the windscreen and at 8;000 I was VMC; no longer taking on ice; and it was slowly melting off the leading edges.I cancelled IFR; gave a heartfelt thanks to ATC; and proceeded to my destination; where I made a visual approach and landing. I called the TRACON to let them know everything was fine and to thank them again. What did I learn?-Even on a very short flight with what seemed to be solid 'outs;' I should have exercised the alternatives sooner 'either' climbed or turned around sooner. I have never seen icing conditions change that fast and now I have.-Declaring an emergency was the right thing to do and it got me out of the clouds. In retrospect; declaring even a few minutes earlier would have made a positive difference in how much ice accreted. ATC was able to give me a descent more than two thousand feet below MVA.",,,,"C210 pilot experiences icing conditions at 9;000 feet with no ability to descend due to a MVA of 8;500 feet.

Mixture full rich; prop high...while I pushed the prop control in; the RPM's didn't change; there was no increase in RPMs but a drop; then I proceeded to add throttle hoping to gain some power back on the engine but it didn't affect it; the manifold gauge would increase but the power on the engine wasn't increasing; almost seemed like the engine was stuck on idle. Realizing there was something wrong with the engine I kept my descent but now trying to maintain about 90 kts. I was already cleared to land but I reported some engine trouble to the controller; at about 2500 ft.

While getting close to the road my configuration was no flaps; power to idle; prop full in; mixture rich. Right before my flare onto the road; I cut off the mixture; and then decided to put the landing gear down. I decided to wait longer for the landing gear to come down because I wanted to improve my chances on trying to make it to the airport runway. The nose gear locked down but not the mains; the planes landed on its belly on the center of the road; but then the left wing hit a road sign breaking the fuel tank and sending the aircraft into a 180 turn and leaving the aircraft in a ditch in between both traffic lanes. After impact then I reported to the tower that I was ok and that I was shutting down all comms. I turned off the avionics; starter off; and master switch off; and then I evacuated the aircraft. For this trip I had 89 usable gallons (the aircraft was topped off); I departed on a direct flight burning 14 gallons per hour. While en route I had a constant tail wind at 10;500 ft. which gave me 165 kts indicated airspeed; and around 180-185 kts ground speed indicated by my portable GPS.

Upon entering the clouds experienced excessive Nose Up Attitude which I believe increased the P210's left turning tendency. This combination of excessive Pitch Up and P-Factor caused the plane to veer left of the straight ahead climb to 1;800 MSL before the right turn called for by the DP. The excessive Nose Up trim triggered a red chevron (+20'?) on my Aspen 1000 PRO SV pointing toward the ground indicating a dangerously high Nose Up attitude. Realizing I was not in full control of the airplane my training to fly the airplane kicked in and I focused on reducing the Pitch Attitude to a normal climb attitude of +7.5' and rolling in the much needed right rudder trim. At all times my IAS remained above Vx (80 KIAS) but did descend below Vy (100 KIAS). At no time did the Stall Warning horn buzz. The Tower informed me that I was 'turning in the wrong direction' (Left rather than Right). Within what I estimate is 30 seconds of this announcement I broke out on top and then resumed course. My P210 was loaded to an aft - but within limits - CG (49' within a 37' - 52' range). I had not flown this airplane in this heavy (about 100 lbs. below gross weight) and aft CG W&B configuration before. I tried to compensate by wheeling in slightly less NOSE UP Trim and slightly more RIGHT RUDDER Trim. Obviously I had not compensated would have properly set a 7.5' Nose Up attitude and so free up more time to compensate with the additional Right Rudder Trim called for. Prior to this flight I had only flown in forward CG configurations so this unfamiliarity contributed to my poor takeoff performance. (The P210 is known for being Nose Heavy; when being flown (as I typically do) with neither mid nor rear seat passengers). In addition; my previous 1;000+/- flight hours were in Cessna pressurized Skymasters in which aft CG loadings were seldom a concern and; perhaps even more importantly required little; if any; Rudder Trim adjustments during Takeoff. So far as I know there was neither a terrain (I am familiar with the surrounding area) nor any traffic conflict. I plan to practice Full Power takeoffs (first VFR; then under the hood) in similar configurations to determine the appropriate aft CG Pre-Flight Takeoff Rudder and Nose Trim settings and to familiarize myself with the sensations such a Takeoff into the clouds may present.",,,,"C210 pilot reports taking off into IMC with a heavily loaded aircraft with an aft CG.

The equipment involved a brand new installation of a Garmin G500 'glass-panel' and a two year installation of a Garmin GTN750/650 Nav/Com pair providing navdata to the G500 and Cessna 400B autopilot (using signals from the correct Garmin box).The scenario:1) The wrong ILS approach was entered into the GTN 750/650 pair (namely ILS-1L rather than ILS-1R).2) The first approach was flown from the arrival gate (HUSKA) to the extension of runway 1L:  at which time both pilot and controller noted the error and the pilot was redirected to the final fix for ILS-1R.  The turn to the south was made; and the autopilot system redirected the aircraft to the north.  Conversations followed between the pilot and tower controller as to what was happening.  The pilot reported that he could not obtain reliable direction on the DG portion of the G500.3) In the cockpit while hand flying the aircraft; the pilot was finally able to maintain control and after a few minutes of struggling start placing the aircraft on course; however; when the autopilot was re-engaged; everything went downhill.  The pilot completely disconnected the autopilot; hand flew and stabilized the aircraft.  It should be noted (and usually happens) that when confronted with problems a pilot's instrument scan becomes somewhat poor.  This happened in this case and altitude control suffered.4) Finally; with the aircraft under control; back on approach; straight and level; on assigned altitude and heading; and as the pilot entered the correct ILS 1R procedure into the GTN pair; he noticed that the GTN pair was in 'suspend'  That is to say the GTN system was flying the missed approach for ILS-1L !!!!5) With the system now properly set up; the autopilot was reengaged and a 'perfect' approach and landing to runway 1R was made.The pilot had recently flown an IPC with his instructor to be able to prove to himself that he could use the new glass panel (installed in Jan/Feb 2015) in IMC.  Supposedly the pilot was familiar with the GTN operation - i.e.; he was aware that the GTN would set up a missed approach.  The pilot had two previous IFR flights with the G500 equipment; several practice sessions and one IPC before making this flight.  He felt confident!It is known that GNSS steering is set in G500 and transferred to the autopilot whenever the HDG 'button' is pressed and held for over two seconds.  Sometime during the events of the 'bad' approach this fact was overlooked by the pilot.  Thus; when he set CRS heading into the DG and hand flew the aircraft; all was fine.  As soon as he fully engaged the autopilot (to relieve some of the work load); the autopilot followed the GNSS (roll steering) signal which was the missed approach!The pilot; at the time of the incident; was here in order for the installation to have a few problems corrected while he attended the GARMIN G600/500: GTN 750/650 course.  It would have been a far better approach (pun intended) to have taken this course far earlier:  however; it was the first time this year that Garmin offered the course.It is imperative that a pilot fully know his equipment - unfortunately in this case even though the pilot knew his equipment and had carefully trained:  more was needed.",,,,"A C210 pilot reports the wrong ILS approach was entered into the GTN 750/650 pair (namely ILS-1L rather than ILS-1R).

Eventually the problems are sorted out and a successful coupled ILS approach is accomplished.",

Picked up Houston Center and requested VFR Flight Following. Was cleared into class B airspace. While enroute; I had attempted several times to pick up ATIS; but could not. ATC (Approach I believe) asked if I had current ATIS to which I replied no. but was trying. After trying several more times; I notified ATC that I could not pick up ATIS; and was limited to XM weather that I had on board. ATC replied that they would give me the weather; and he did. (Wind/Alt./ Setting/Runway). Was then switched over to tower. I announced my position and intentions to enter Right Downwind for runway 35L. Tower responded and confirmed right downwind for 35L; and that he would call my base. Tower called my base. Upon needing to turn final; I asked tower if I could turn final and then asked for clearance to land 35L. Upon landing; I used the length of the runway. Near the end of the runway; tower asked where I was parking; to which I replied 'to the FBO'. Tower replied that I had gone too far and instructed a 180 and back taxi. Tower then initiated a 'go-around' for inbound traffic. (Helicopter). Tower had a brief conversation with helicopter trying to determine whether a go-around was actually needed. It appeared as though the go around was not initiated. Tower then addressed me and asked that I exit [taxiway] E and go to ground. After departing the runway and exiting [taxiway] E; I switched to ground and announced my decision.At least two attempts were made to reach ground whereby I stated my position and destination to which there was no reply. As I determined whether or not to go back to tower frequency to get help; a lady began speaking to other traffic. She then calls me? I responded and let her know that I was on Echo headed to the FBO. She then let me know that she needed to give me the phone number to contact tower for a possible pilot deviation. Upon parking; I immediately called the tower. Tower said that I was instructed to exit E; STOP; contact ground; wait for further instruction. I let him know that I had not heard that command; but would be certain to comply hereafter. His response was that they were essentially locking down on everyone and were reporting 100%. He said that they were doing the 'exit; stop; go to ground; wait for progressive' was for the hot zones on the East side of the runway (end of 35R). I was taxiing on the west. I immediately called a mentor to get advice and instruction on how I should handle. He recommended that I wait a few hours to let things 'cool off' and then reach out to the tower again. I called the tower again in hopes of researching all aspects of the event to clarify the role that I played in the incident. When I called the tower back; I spoke with a different gentleman (who seemed to be a manager). He asked for a moment to review the file. While he was reading the file aloud; I concluded that the report being filed was not completely accurate. The report indicated that I was given the command to 'Land 35L; Exit Taxiway Echo; Stop; and Go to ground.' This could not be the case as I had already landed; and was well beyond Echo before the Tower asked where I was parking. It did not appear as though he included the 180 / back taxi command in his report. Or the communications back and forth between me; the tower and the helicopter he was initiating a go-around with. I cannot recall the command to STOP after exiting Echo. After conversing the second time with the tower; he also mentioned that it was my job to pick up ATIS before landing to attain all relevant information. It was at this time that I notified him that I was unable to pick up ATIS; and that ATC had given me the numbers. He said that he would add this to the report for me.On this second call; he also said that they were trying to create a new culture whereby everyone would stop after exiting; go to ground; and then get progressive instruction. He mentioned that it was causing confusion and that there was really no aviation terminology for what they were desiring to happen. He also mentioned that this was the second of such efforts. Initially; they were advising pilots to 'Land 35L; hold short Taxiway E'. This was causing too much confusion because most pilots had no way of determining the distance to Taxiway E. so it was a recent change to initiate the new 'Exit runway/STOP/Go to ground/wait for progressive.' One last thought. If this tower/airport is changing to a modified sequence for real safety measures; and creating a new culture; one would think that they would be sure to re-iterate and verify compliance upon contact. 'Enter right downwind for 35L. Are you familiar with our runway exit procedures?'",,,,"BE35 pilot experiences confusion after landing full length Runway 35L at DWH with a destination on the west side of the field.

I called ATC; advised them of the failure.  I initially was given a vector to ZZZ; continued my climb; broke out at 15;000 feet.  I leveled off at 15;000 feet VFR on top; and could see that the overcast layer I had been in was turning to a broken layer over ZZZ and beyond.  I performed the emergency checklist and tried unsuccessfully to reset the electrical system.  Upon reaching ZZZ I advised ATC that I would proceed to ZZZ1 because of maintenance facilities there and turned off the electrical system.  I proceeded in that direction for approximately 5-6 minutes and decided that I would return to ZZZ and land.  I turned the radio and transponder back on and advised ATC of decision.  Circling over ZZZ in broken conditions I was advised that I was cleared for a visual approach to land at ZZZ and given a phone number to call after landing.  I performed the before landing checklist; lowered the landing gear; again turned the master off and started my descent.  I descended from 15;000 in VFR conditions through a broken layer.  The bases were at approximately 9;000 feet.  I referenced my iPad that was connected to my Stratus receiver that has inflight weather and determined that it would be VFR all the way to ZZZ2.  I then elected to proceed to ZZZ2 at 8;500 FT which I did.  VFR all the way.  I decided that I would leave the gear down and save the battery for the flaps and not to contact ATC with the aircraft radio.  Enroute to ZZZ2 I tried to contact ATC with my hand held radio and cell phone to no avail.  Within the vicinity of ZZZ using my hand held to communicate with another aircraft that was departing and sequenced myself into the traffic pattern.  I entered the traffic pattern at ZZZ2; lowered the flaps; and landed without incident. Within two minutes of shutting down ATC called me on my cell and advised me they were looking for me and I told them what happened.My pre-flight planning indicated that the forecast weather would be VFR west ward of ZZZ and the actual weather lived up to the forecast. Having a hand held radio; iPad; and Status receiver gave me adequate back up for this situation. I had just done an IPC the week before in my aircraft and was ready for an Electrical Failure in IMC. The previous month I completed a systems course with the Cessna Pilots Association for my aircraft.  That course gave me real insight into how long the battery would last in an Electrical Failure scenario.

At this time the cigar lighter power resistor was found to be very hot. Aircraft was towed to maintenance. Upon investigation; it was found that one of the connections to the power resistor was quite loose. This apparently increased the resistance and i2R heat production at that point.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  1) I will in the future consult the AFD data when in doubt as to the Tower operating hours 2) I will always attempt to pick up clearances on the ground; although in this instance it would not have been through the Tower but rather through FSS frequency; 3) Before taxi; I will always seek to establish two way communication with ATC or FSS simply to make sure the aircraft radios are working properly and that what I believe the transmitter selector is selected to is in fact what it is selected.  4) While I make it a practice to monitor 121.5 in COM2; it is what ultimately allowed the system and me to discover the problem 5) I will not let the absence of taxi and runway lighting lead me to believe that the Tower is closed. POSSIBLE PREVENTIVE ACTIONS: If the Tower monitored 121.5 perhaps it could have redirected me as did the approach controller.",,,,"A pilot departed a towered airport using CTAF procedures on 121.5 while the Tower was open because he had referenced [website] data which indicated the Tower closed at XD:00 local when in fact it closed at XE:00.

To do that; I wanted to add fuel; and put in an order with the FBO at Wittman. After waiting several hours without being fueled; I changed plans; and decided to depart Wittman and fly west or southwest to an airport with more accessible fuel. My first takeaway from this experience is to not leave my fuel order to the last day of my stay at Airventure; I could have taken care of this issue two or three days ahead of time and then left when I wanted to.I departed Wittman Field with my wife and three children in the plane. Due to the unusual tower communication procedures in effect during Airventure; I did not speak to ground or tower while taxiing for takeoff or when I was given my takeoff clearance. This left me without an opportunity to do what I usually do; which is request VFR flight following from tower before I depart. My second takeaway from this experience is to get the local approach or center frequency loaded up in my radio before I depart Oshkosh; and call them up as soon as I'm out of the pattern.After takeoff; I set my heading for an airport in Nebraska with inexpensive avgas and lunch. After flying for 10 minutes or so; I noticed clouds up ahead; and I checked my satellite weather system. It showed a significant thunderstorm that stretched for 200 miles; from my northwest to my southwest. We had enough gas to fly for 3 or more hours; so the weather didn't present an issue; other than the need to divert around it. My third takeaway from this experience is; during all that time I was waiting on the ground to takeoff; I should have checked the inflight weather system once it loaded up the NEXRAD images; if I had; I would have known earlier that I would not be going straight to my intended airport; and I might have been able to make a better diversion decision.Not interested in penetrating any part of the indicated weather system; I picked a southerly heading that kept me out of reported precipitation; and began to search for suitable airports along my route westward that had fuel; and would not be engulfed in the storm while I was on the ground there. At this time; I was flying on a southwesterly heading at the VFR altitude of 4;500 feet. Looking up alternate airports consumed most of my attention after paying attention primarily to the safe operations of the aircraft and secondarily storm avoidance. Before I realized it; I was inside the Madison Class C. I pulled up the dimensions of the Class C on my PDF; and saw that it went up to 4;900 feet. Since I was at 4;500 feet; I was inside the Class C; but had not been in two-way communications with TRACON; as I wasn't thinking much about communicating; fixating as I was on aviating and navigating. I immediately initiated a climb to 5;000; and then called up Madison to get into communications with them. The rest of the flight was uneventful. I kept the storm on my right; and refueled; and continued southwest around it.",,,,"Cessna P210 pilot reported an airspace incursion when he was preoccupied with a weather deviation.",

The Pipeline Patrol Flight was heading more or less direct to ZZZ (300 deg); and included a handoff to ABQ Center. At that time I chose to cancel flight following and continue with my own navigation. Maneuvering due to ceilings and rain showers to stay VFR. The flight path was basically direct to ZZZ. I started a descent from 8;500 approx. 15 miles SE of ZZZ on a heading of 290 deg. Monitoring 121.50 (as usual; when I'm not on freq. with ATC) I hear a call to my N-number; to switch to 125.90 Approach freq. which I immediately complied with. I was given a squawk Code; then informed that I had 'A possible pilot deviation into an active TFR and make an immediate turn to exit the area to the South.' I Complied with their instructions and made a Turn to 150 deg. I was then informed that I had flown into the TFR approx. 8 miles and to copy a telephone number to call. Onboard I have a Garmin 510 GPS with XM NEXRAD Weather (which includes a graphical depiction of TFR's to Scale); that I had been referencing the entire flight. The depiction showed a Yellow circle centered over LAS that extended out to the 5;000 foot ring of the Las Vegas Class Bravo. The second TFR appeared to center over LSV extending approx. 5 miles in diameter. That was my reference in the cockpit at the time of the 'possible deviation'. I took a picture of the Garmin 510 screen with my cell phone a short time later showing my flight path respective to the TFR(s) depiction. ATC also informed me that the depiction of the TFR was incorrect and that the TFR extended out to the 30 mile 'mode C' veil. That is how I supposedly flew into the TFR. Due to my lower altitude at the time; ATC was having trouble reading my radio transmissions; so an air carrier flight crew relayed my transmissions back to ATC. I asked whether or not I could continue to start my patrol; RTB; or land and was asked by ATC what was my intended point of landing. To which I replied ZZZ1. I then was instructed to continue to start my patrol outside of the TFR and contact Los Angeles Center; which I did and was with them for approx. 2min. was asked again what my intended point of landing was; what was the route of flight and what the patrol altitude would be. I replied with 'picking up the pipeline along I-15 at 500 feet AGL and following the pipeline to ZZZ1.' It was then that the controller told me to squawk VFR; RADAR services terminated. I started my patrol without incident and continued my flight normally.I called the number I was given and spoke to Mr. X; Manager of the Las Vegas TRACON. He was aware of my situation and took my contact information including my name; pilot certificate number; mailing address; and cell number. He informed me as to what had happened and to 'expect a phone call and or visit'.In closing I would like to say that if I did encroach on a TFR it was purely an accident. I used the information I had in the cockpit to make the decision to fly to intercept the pipeline at a reasonably safe distance from the TFR; but at no time did I intend to fly into the protected area. In hindsight; I would have been better off staying with ABQ center flight following and would have been kept out of the restricted area. With that said; I did comply immediately with ATC's instructions as safely and expeditiously as possible. I have 20 years of flying experience and this is the first time I have had to give out my contact information. If I had to guess; I would say that if the TFR did in fact extend to the 30 mile 'mode C' ring; the visual depiction should have shown that; it did not.",,,,"A C210 pilot reports inadvertently entering a TFR at 6;500 feet; 22 NM ESE of LAS; which was not depicted on his Garmin 510 GPS with XM NEXRAD Weather.

After departing; [I] requested and was provided flight following. After transitioning into Travis Approach controlled airspace - communicating with Travis Approach; [I] was handed off to [another] Travis Approach [controller]. [I] was approximately 20 miles southwest of Yolo County airport; Travis advised the 'jump area' off Yolo to be active and advised a turn 20 degrees to the left from 335 to 315. Then; continuing in flight and when [I] was directly west of Yolo; [I] made a request to turn back on course to [my destination]; which was then 336.Shortly thereafter; Travis Approach provided a traffic advisory indicating traffic was one (or two miles - don't recall for sure) at [my] 10 o'clock position; heading the same direction; at the same altitude. [I] spotted traffic and advised traffic was in sight. At that point; traffic appeared to be at an altitude 50-100 feet lower than [me]; and at least one mile away at the 10; moving to 9 o'clock position. As [I] was moving from the other traffic at the 10 o'clock position to the 9 o'clock position; traffic had moved closer and was now directly off the wing at approximately 3/8 to 1/2 miles.While [I] was passing and the other traffic was moving from [my] 9 o'clock position to 7-8 o'clock position; traffic continued to move closer and [I] turned approximately 10 degrees to the right. Traffic passed behind [my] position from 7-6-5 o'clock positions and appeared to pass somewhere between 300-500 feet in horizontal distance behind [me] and about 50-100 feet vertical distance below [me].Traffic then reported to Travis Approach the proximity and closeness; and indicated feeling the wake of [my aircraft]. Travis Approach didn't reply to [my] knowledge; as Travis handed [me] off to Oakland Center. [I] reported occurrence to Oakland Center. Traffic has also been handed off to Oakland Center and heard the explanation and discussion between Oakland Center and [me]; and essentially acknowledged concurrence with [me]. Oakland Center made both [me] and traffic (reported as a 182) aware of Travis Approach's telephone number to file a report; and indicated Travis Approach is a training program for ATC and reports help enhance safety. Both aircraft indicated they would call and make a report with Travis Approach; and also file [a safety report]. [I] attempted to call the number and received an error message.It was stated in the discussion with Oakland Control that [I] was heading 336 and [the 182] was heading 351 at first advisory. The proximity circumstance could have likely been avoided if Travis Approach had not indicated traffic was heading in the same direction when they weren't; but instead were slightly converging; and if Travis Approach had advised either or both aircraft to turn to headings away from the slowly converging headings.",,"I was cruising at 8;500 feet at 130 KTS with a ground track of 351. I was VFR with flight following from Travis North sector. I was near the Williams VOR and almost to the point where I expected Travis would hand me off to Oakland Center.I heard Travis give a traffic call of traffic at 12 o'clock; 2 miles; same direction; to another aircraft. Immediately afterward I got a call for traffic at 6 o'clock; same direction; 8;700 feet. I realized that the earlier call was about me. I asked Travis if the aircraft was overtaking and the response was yes; Centurion at 160 KTS. I assumed that Travis was tracking both of us and the other pilot could see me.10-15 seconds later a green and white Cessna flashed by my right side at exactly my altitude and I estimate at most 100-200 feet away. I have formation flying experience and am confident in my estimate of the distance. It crossed in front of me no more about 300 feet away. I flew through the wake and felt it strongly.I called Travis and reported the near miss and that I had flown through a strong wake. My recollection is that Travis' only response was to hand me off to Oakland Center. He had also just handed the other aircraft off.I switched frequencies and the other pilot was already excitedly talking with Oakland. The controller said that when we were handed to her our data blocks were completely overlapping so at first she thought we were flying formation.The controller talked with both of us for some time. I believe she had handed off her other traffic to someone else. The other aircraft was a Cessna Centurion. He said he was tracking about 336 at an indicated 8;700 feet and 160 KTS. I was tracking 351 at an indicated 8;500 and 130 KTS. He said that the controller had noted traffic and said we were traveling in the same direction at approximately the same altitude. He assumed that he would pass cleanly or the controller would have told him to divert. He said that he only saw me at the very last second and had just started to divert when he passed me. I told both the other pilot and controller that I pretty much agreed with his statements. Our recollections of the communications with Travis were also very close.I called Travis and talked with someone in ATC. I didn't get his name. He told me to expect a call from his boss. I haven't heard from him.I believe that the other aircraft was probably on auto-pilot so the pilot thought there was no conflict when he was told we were heading in the same direction so he was not looking outside. I clearly had the right of way but that doesn't help much if someone takes your wing off.I believe the primary causes of this very close call were:(1) Poor communications from Travis.(2) Travis failure to provide diversion instructions to either aircraft.(3) The pilot of [the other aircraft] failure to see and avoid when overtaking.",,"Two pilots of single engine aircraft reported an NMAC with each other while in Travis Approach Control airspace.",

After completing before takeoff checklist for a flap 10 takeoff I initiated the takeoff roll. The engine indications were 23 inches manifold pressure and 2500 RPM; the normal static RPM for this airplane. The aircraft accelerated normally to about 60 MPH. At around 60 the acceleration rate seemed to slow. I looked at the RPM which had decayed slightly to 2450.

Since we were at a lower altitude than my home airport and the airplane seemed like it wanted to fly I elected to continue. There was a slight rise at the end of the runway and the airplane would neither accelerate nor climb above it. The airplane touched down at about 50 MPH on the slope with the airspeed decaying. The touchdown was uneventful and we decelerated to a near stop. We then stopped abruptly and the airplane started to nose over but then settled back down. The engine was stopped. I asked my passenger if he was ok and we both agreed we were ok. After assessing that there was no smoke or fire I secured the mixture; fuel; magnetos; battery and other shutdown items.

I could hear no responses from the other aircraft; but approach continued to ask if he had a visual on traffic; even after the jet passed my position. The jet passed approximately 500 feet below my aircraft.Because of the time of day and aircraft positions; the sun was likely obscuring my aircraft from view; contributing to the other pilot's inability to get a visual on traffic.Flying with VFR flight following or on an IFR flight plan would have opened communications between myself and Cincinnati; which would have allowed a confirmation of my position to approach; and vectoring traffic for further separation.",,,,"C210 pilot reported an air carrier aircraft passed about 500 feet below his aircraft in the vicinity of CVG airport.",

Shortly after my CTAF announcement that I was on a 5 mile final for RWY 35; another aircraft announced taxi to RWY 35 for departure. I maintained radio contact with the other aircraft and we exchanged information several times as to location and status. With less than 3 miles from RWY 35; the other aircraft reported it had sufficient time to take off before my arrival on RWY 35. I was intently focused on being sure that there would be no risk of collision and was preparing to go-around when the other aircraft reported it was airborne off RWY 35 and making a left turn to the west; so I elected to continue on for landing. Due to the distraction of dealing with the other aircraft; I failed to confirm that my landing gear was fully extended. In fact it was only partially extended; and this resulted in the propeller hitting the runway.

Winds 260/4. Used 20 degree flaps since planning a touch and go. Touched down on center line; normal smooth landing. On landing; the plane seemed to be listing unusually to the left. I have 843 hours in this tail number; and likely as many landings; so I recognized the list immediately. And it started pulling to the left. Held off on adding power. As I slowed further; the plane started pulling harder left. Added power to see if I could get it back in the air; but it kept pulling left; so I quickly cut power as I headed off the side of the runway. I used full right yoke and right rudder to keep the left wing up; until I came to a stop in the dirt; upright. No injuries. ELT initiated on the final stop; so I turned it off; shut off the engine; and fuel. This was my first flight after getting the plane back from its annual inspection and some avionics installation (ADS-B out and in). So I was careful to take my time in the checklists. I distinctly remember completing the landing checklist; and seeing the green light for gear down. I also did not hear a gear warning when I pulled power to idle before touching down. On inspection; the left gear was folded under the aircraft. The main gear well doors were closed; so the left gear had collapsed onto the door. The gear left a visible trench in the dirt from the point it left the runway. The gear leg doors were open; however; and should have closed in a normal gear sequence. The landing gear hydraulic pack had been replaced with an overhauled unit 8 months prior; about 20 hours earlier. While this was my first flight after the annual inspection; the maintenance shop had flown it to a nearby maintenance facility and back for the avionics work; after the annual; so it had at least 2 landings on it since the annual. My lesson learned was to not just trust the green gear light - had I checked the gear mirror I had installed on the right wing; perhaps I would have seen the gear leg doors were still open; hinting that the gear down sequence had not completed. And maybe I would have looked at the gear on the left side for longer; making sure it was fully extended - I believe I gave it the normal glance; but don't distinctly recall how it appeared (e.g.; was it that landing or one of the many prior landings that I am recalling).",,,,"A C-210's left landing gear collapsed on landing after it apparently had not fully extended without any failure indication.

Departed ZZZ1 for ZZZ. Upon contacting ZZZ tower was directed to enter left base RWY 25. Flew uneventful visual approach and touched down just passed the numbers at approximately 75-80 knots. Upon applying brakes left brake pedal reacted normally while right pedal appeared to depress to the stop with no/minimal back-pressure or braking apparent on right wheel. Continued to apply maximum possible left pedal/brake pressure while modulating nose wheel to the right in order to continue braking while staying on the RWY and began pumping right pedal/brake. Near end of RWY right pedal/brake began to respond to pumping and right brake effectiveness sufficiently to bring the aircraft to a full approximately 20 feet into the gravel over-run area at the departure end of the RWY. Right brake pedal then gave solid pressure and normal braking and the aircraft was taxied back to the pavement and then clear of the RWY via the taxiway. Further testing while stopped showed both right and left brakes to be functioning properly therefore Ground control was called with request to taxi to hangers which was executed carefully and with normal brake function.As a note; toe brakes and parking brake system were used during taxi and runup operations at both ZZZ and ZZZ1 prior to outbound and return flight as well as landing at ZZZ1 and gave no indication of malfunction at those times.Subsequent inspection revealed debris in the right brake master cylinder and the piston O-ring to have become fairly hard with a slight indentation along approximately 5 degrees of the circumference of the O-ring. Cause of the malfunction is believed to be a result of aged o-rings with subsequent reduced elasticity exacerbated by debris which may have wedged between the o-ring and cylinder wall reducing the ability of the right master brake cylinder to build sufficient braking pressure. Braking effectiveness returned upon pumping of the brake pedal apparently dislodging the debris and allowing the o-ring to have sufficient contact with the cylinder wall. It is surmised that debris may have entered the system via the fluid filler hole during level checking at a recent annual inspection. Logbooks show previous master cylinder rebuild or o-ring replacement to be more than 10 years ago.CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:Both brake master cylinders were rebuilt using new o-rings obtained from Cessna parts. Area around filler holes was cleaned of debris; hydraulic fluid and debris flushed from system; and system was reassembled and proper operation verified.Further; a brake check line item has been added to the landing checklist to be performed after gear down to determine brake function prior to landing. Check consists of depressing the brake pedals and observing proper pedal height and resistance.",,,,"The pilot of a Cessna 210 reported that during rollout the left brake pedal felt normal and the right brake went all the to the stop and had no braking effect of the right main gear wheel; resulting in a runway excursion.",

I had just performed a diversion as part of the practical test to the airport area and remained at 5;500 at the examiners request. Approximately 2 miles from airport the examiner closed the throttle to simulate an engine failure. I immediately established best glide speed; set up for a left down wind; and simulated a mayday call. I then preformed the engine failure checklist. When I was abeam the approach end of runway 17; I moved the gear lever to the down position and followed through the gear extension by visually and audibly confirming gear down; no gear doors; green light; and handle back to neutral. Then I commented to the examiner that I knew I had the runway within gliding distance. When turning final I told the examiner that I planned a touchdown point past the large tree that was near mid field of the 6300 feet runway. The decision was to provide clearance from the obstacle close to the runway. There was no gear up warning horn. The runway was down sloping so it did not seem odd that we were in the flare attitude for longer than normal. The examiner suddenly said; 'Gear; go around!'; so I added power and felt the examiner take the controls. After I added power I perceived a faint buzzing sound and felt a slight vibration. Now; going around; I then confirmed that the gear handle was in the down position. At that point there was not enough usable runway to make a safe landing. With the examiner now in control of the aircraft; he recycled the gear and went around the pattern for a landing.I would have to conclude there was a landing gear system failure.",,"I was serving as a Designated Pilot Examiner administering a Commercial Pilot-Airplane Practical Test. Pursuant to 14 CFR Part 61.47; the applicant was the pilot in command in all respects. The pilot in command has logged in excess of 850 flight hours including 14 hours in the incident aircraft.I announced a 'simulated engine failure' and reduced the throttle to idle. The applicant promptly initiated the necessary immediate actions required by the Pilot's Operating Handbook and otherwise performed this beginning requirements of Task IX (B) satisfactorily. While in the descent the applicant found himself abeam the intended landing area and established on a modified down-wind leg. The applicant also indicated that there was a tower in the vicinity of the approach end of the runway and that we would need to keep an eye on it. As part of our earlier briefing I indicated that we would both need to be vigilant for hazards outside the cockpit (namely other aircraft; large birds; and other obstructions such as towers) thus requiring both of us to divert our attention to matters outside the aircraft as well as inside the aircraft.Just prior to turning a modified base leg; the applicant indicated that he had sufficient altitude to make his landing area. The applicant then announced 'gear down' whereupon I saw the applicant physically move his right hand to the gear down lever and manipulate such lever so as to lower the gear. Both the applicant and I also believe we heard a sound consistent with a hydraulic gear motor indicating that the landing gear would be coming down as anticipated. The applicant then picked up his checklist and began reciting the applicable items necessary for a safe landing. I then briefly returned my attention to matters outside for a few seconds to ascertain that we were; in fact; in a suitable position for landing. As this was a modified traffic pattern (taking into account that the applicant was suffering from a simulated engine failure); the turns from the downwind leg to base leg and from base leg to final were; necessarily; shorter. During this time I heard the applicant announce that the before landing check had been completed; that the gear was down and locked; and that he was adjusting his flap setting to better assist with the landing. At no time did I recall ever hearing a gear warning horn or any other indication of an unsafe gear condition. In addition; in looking at the landing gear handle; it was in the down neutral position where it would normally be after lowering the landing gear.While becoming established on final; the applicant inquired as to when he should make a go around. As the applicant had positioned the aircraft to make a safe landing; I indicated that applicant should prepare to land in accordance with Task IX (B)(vi) of the Practical Test Standards. I then returned my attention outside briefly. As the applicant had sufficient altitude; he elected to pick an intended landing point further down Runway XY that would give him sufficient clearing from two nearby trees. Within seconds thereafter; the applicant encountered a large number of unknown birds outside the left side of the aircraft. However; those birds quickly changed flight path and were no longer an obstacle to contend with.As we were getting closer to the intended touchdown area I made a final check of the cockpit area. As there were no clouds that day; the Sun was shining briefly into the cockpit. As I raised my hand to shield my view; I noticed that the applicant airspeed was still at best glide; and that his flaps were set to an appropriate flap setting.This particular model of the C-210 aircraft has two lights with respect to the gear indicating system. One is amber; the other is green. In looking at both of these lights in this final sweep of the cockpit area; I could not tell if the green light was illuminated or not given the direction and glint of the Sun. For that matter; I could nottell if the amber light was illuminated either (although both had worked properly earlier that day). And again; the gear handle did appear to be where it should be after the lowering of the gear as mentioned above.At that point I glanced outside to again ensure that there were no hazards on the runway. In doing so I then noticed that the right main gear was not locked into the position it normally would be for a down and locked condition as viewed from the right side of the aircraft. I then announced this to the applicant and instructed him to make an immediate go around. The applicant reacted immediately even though I was in the process of placing my hands on the throttle and control yoke to ensure that we established a climb.After the initial application of full power; the engine began to vibrate but in a manner consistent with a full power application. In discussing this later; the applicant indicated that he felt we might have hit something with the propeller even though that contact was not necessarily obvious to me under the circumstances.At approximately 50 feet above the ground; the applicant then confirmed with me that I had the controls. I took the controls and; as a continued landing straight ahead was not an option; I immediately positioned the aircraft to re-enter a modified traffic pattern so as to return for landing. During this process and as part of the go-around I moved the landing gear handle to the gear up position. While completing a modified traffic pattern; I went over the before landing checklist using the familiar GUMP acronym and ensured that the landing gear handle was selected to the down position. I was busy diverting my attention to matters inside the aircraft and out; but in any event within a few seconds the right main gear appeared to be down and locked. The applicant confirmed the same for the left main gear (which was not visible to me given my position). Given the direction of the Sun it was still difficult to tell if the green gear light was illuminated but ultimately it appeared that it was. I completed the landing which was otherwise un-eventful. I brought the aircraft to a stop and completed the shutdown procedure. I then exited the aircraft with the applicant whereupon we promptly noticed the damage to the propeller. After further; but briefly; inspecting the rest of the aircraft; there did not appear to be any further damage nor any damage specifically to the under belly of the aircraft leading me to conclude that it was only the propeller that came into contact with the ground.",,"A C210 pilot and flight examiner reported a landing gear extension system malfunction that occurred during a check ride; resulting in a propeller strike; go-around and return for normal landing.",

Two aircraft were IFR inbound to an airport. Aircraft Y was slightly behind and at 5;000 feet and direct to the airport. Aircraft X was slightly closer and at 6;000 feet setup to execute the RNAV approach into the airport. When Aircraft X checked in I informed him that I would have to issue holding instructions as the approach would make him later to the airport but if he wanted to execute a Visual Approach we could get him inbound first. Aircraft X said he would take the visual so I cleared him inbound direct; cleared him to descend to 4;100 feet which is the Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA). I told them to report the field in sight for a Visual Approach.Aircraft Y was informed that he was number 2 and would have to climb to 5;100 feet to provide separation between him and his friend both inbound at the same time. Aircraft Y then turned 90 degrees to the north (right at Aircraft X) and asked if he should go direct to the initial approach fix for the RNAV approach. I told him no and that I saw his turn and that he needed to continue westbound for the moment until we had altitude separation before I could issue a turn to the north. While this is happening Aircraft X crosses my boundary and I issue 3;900 feet which is my MIA and I inform him if he is unable to get the field in sight we may have to go to plan B as there were no lower altitudes I could provide. Aircraft X then proceeds to descend below 3;900 feet all the way to 2;100 feet and I asked him 'Do you have the airport in sight?' Aircraft X responds 'I have the ground in sight.' I am then getting my supervisor's attention to let her know what is going on (now about both aircraft) and that I need to have the brasher warning so I could provide it to them.  While I am getting her attention Aircraft X says field in sight cancel IFR... I accept his cancellation and then clear Aircraft Y inbound on the RNAV as it was obvious to me that 3;900 feet was not able to provide visual conditions to the field. I then give a briefing to the relieving controller and came here to report what had happened.Both pilots need a refresher as to what IFR means and maybe take a break for a bit. One pilot almost had an IFR to IFR conflict by turning without instruction; the other could have had collision with terrain as he descended below his assigned altitude... ridiculous!",,,,"An aircraft was descended to 3;900 feet for a Visual Approach.

However; I included at least one item that I have added to my personal checklist for the aircraft; although it is not in the Pilot's Operating Handbook: I checked the sight glass in the landing gear fluid reservoir to confirm that fluid remained visible in the sight glass. I viewed gear fluid in the sight glass; which I believed to be of a sufficient quantity. I performed a runup procedure prior to flight; with checklist items generally as listed in the Pilot's Operating Handbook; plus several personally-added items to reflect equipment installed in our aircraft; such as checking the autopilot for correct override capability. The takeoff roll was normal; and the initial climb-out was normal. I placed the landing gear lever in the 'up' position as I climbed out; near the end of the runway. The left main gear dropped down and backward as though it was going to retract; but then proceeded to 'dangle' in the wind with no further motion toward retraction. I placed the gear handle in the 'up' position in an attempt to recycle the gear up; but the gear continued to 'dangle' in the wind with no perceptible motion toward retraction. I decided that a manual extension and precautionary landing would be necessary before continuing my flight; to determine the cause of the malfunction. I placed the gear position handle in the 'down' position; and flew a wide pattern that allowed me time to pump down the gear manually. The gear showed definite progress into the extended position with the manual pump; until it appeared visually to be in a stable; locked; fully extended position. The manual gear pump handle had become extremely stiff as though the fluid had pressed the gear against their stops and further strokes on the gear pump handle would not be possible. However; the green gear-locked light was not lit. I pressed the green light to confirm that the light bulb was not burned out (this is the method of testing the light to be sure it is functional). So I continued to attempt to pump the gear; but the manual gear extension pump handle remained stiff and it gave the tactile feel that the gear had pressed firmly against the stops. I could see the left main gear; asked my passengers to check the right main gear; and I checked the nose gear in the wing mirror. All appeared to be firmly locked into place. I determined that it was likely that the gear was locked; and that the green gear-locked light may have failed to light because the softer and more gradual manual extension may have failed to engage at least one of the gear-locked sensor switches in the same abrupt way that a powered gear extension engages it. And; if I was wrong; I determined that further attempts at raising and lowering the gear at that point would be counter-productive; possibly worsening the situation. I believed that a landing gear which felt and appeared to be down and locked were a better alternative upon landing; than gear that were half way down and flapping in the wind at the point of touchdown (which is what I feared if I attempted further manipulation of the gear position handle). Although I had briefed my passengers on emergency procedures prior to flight; I briefed them again. I asked them to crack open the passenger side door; and I cracked open the pilot side door; in case bending of the fuselage caused them to jam shut on landing. I approached for landing with full flaps; and attempted to touch down at the slowest possible forward speed. The main gear touched first; very softly; but I felt the left main begin to wallow as though it was coming unlocked. Since no part of the airframe or propeller had struck the ground; I began to apply power for a possible go-around. But immediately upon applying power; the left gear gave the rest of the way; and the left wingtip began scraping the runway; so I immediately pulled back power and allowed the aircraft to slide to a stop on the runway. The aircraft was tilted toward the left during its initial slide; so the nosewheel landing gear failed toward the right due to apparent side loads and allowed the propeller to make contact with the runway. The right main gear remained extended; and did not retract or collapse. The aircraft came to rest about 1000 feet from the approach end of the runway; at the intersection of a taxiway on the right side of the runway. I had not turned off the electrical switch because I wanted to maintain contact with traffic in the pattern if necessary; due to the high volume of traffic at the uncontrolled field. My passengers immediately exited the right side of the aircraft; while I made a quick radio transmission to the other aircraft in the pattern to tell them that the runway was closed due to a gear collapse. I turned off electrical switches and climbed out the right side of the aircraft. There was no smoke or fire. The fuel remained contained in the wing tanks; except for a small amount of fuel that began dripping from the left wingtip vent due to its lower orientation. The fuel leak from the wingtip vent tube was stopped by use of a zip tie and rubber glove over the end of the wingtip vent. The damage sustained by the aircraft was typical of a gear-up landing: scraped wingtip; scraped belly skin; bent propeller tips; landing gear damage; bent nosegear doors. Accordingly; I believe that this event constituted an 'incident' and not an 'accident' and that I was not obligated to report the incident as an 'aircraft accident' under 49 C.F.R. section 830.5 because the aircraft did not sustain 'substantial damage' as specifically defined under section 830.2.",,,,"C210 pilot reported his landing gear failed to retract after takeoff. An attempt to manually extend the gear appeared to be successful; but no down indications were obtained. Upon landing; the left main gear collapsed.",

On right base I requested to land long to proceed to east end of 11;000 feet runway to my fuel supplier to take on fuel. I was approved to land as requested. Proceeded to fuel supplier. Truck pulled up and driver notified me that airport would be closing [in fifteen minutes] but that they would do a quick fueling and that I would get out on time. Gave line crew my fuel instructions and went into office to start writing out my payment check. The manager behind the counter repeated the notice that airport would be closing [in fifteen minutes] but that they would get me out before closure. As we watched fuel crew fill my 5 tanks (I had 1;000 miles to my destination) it became obvious that they would not be finished before the closure time. The manager said that she would call the tower and airport manager and 'Get me out' once fueling had been completed. Once fueling was done; she was still on the phone with airport authorities. She made a hand motion for me to get moving while she completed securing permission. I got in the plane; started up and started moving toward the taxiway; approximately 800 yards; until I could clear new building construction in progress and be seen by the tower.During that taxi time I called to notify ground where I was and what was being requested on my behalf. I did not receive a radio reply. I called again as the tower could now see me coming out from behind the new buildings and approached taxiway A. Still no reply. No other radio talk either but this is not strange for this small quiet airport. I moved 300 yards to the hold short line of runway and called ground once again; with no response. Switched to tower and called three times with no response. Knew that my radio was transmitting as I saw the TX indicator light. There was no other radio traffic; nothing moving on the runway or taxiway; no men or equipment working anywhere on the airport. There has been pavement repair work ongoing on the taxiway A for the past year; but not today. I thought; that when they close a class D airport; the tower must close as well. I treated my departure as an uncontrolled field departure; announced my intentions; took off and joined my filed departure route. Time was now [fifteen minutes past airport closing time].   Climbing out on course; going through approximately 8;000 feet; with a filed cruise altitude of 180; I felt that I had to attempt to contact Center somehow to let them know who I was; where I was; get a squawk code and activate my flight plan. It dawned on me that I had a main transmitter that had failed in some manner; but that I had a hand held VHF transceiver on board. Found it in my flight bag; tuned to the Center frequency and made contact. Got the flight plan activated; picked up a squawk code and was then told to contact tower at [departure airport]. Center gave me a phone number to call. I dug my cell phone from my flight bag and attempted to phone the number provided. At the time; I was 40 miles out from the airport and was out of cellphone range. I tried to make contact with the tower with my hand held radio but was also out of range at this time. Right about now my main vacuum pump decided that it had worked long enough and just died. Low vac alarms and lights started flashing. Just what I needed to further complicate my flight. I then decided to first fly the airplane; get to altitude; establish cruise; engage autopilot and THEN try to sort out the vac and radio problems. While completing my climb; I could hear other transmissions on my hand held as well as center talk.I then tried to transmit on my main radio and heard a reply on my hand held. I knew then that I could talk on my main radio and receive on my hand held. Now; to sort out why. I discovered that the noise canceling headset that I had been using had failed in receive mode. My spare was in a padded case; under the rear seat; blocked from my reach by luggage; an oxygen tank; life raft; tool box. Could not be reached in flight my me as single pilot. I made a note of the tower phone number and to call them when I landed. I continued to troubleshoot the lack of reception and found that the speaker switch on the audio panel was in off position. The plane had just completed an annual inspection and major avionics work. I do not normally have the speaker on when I use a noise canceling head sets. Turned it on and was back to full radio function without having to use a portable radio with limited range. As I do have a standby electric vac system; I turned it on and restored vacuum function.I completed the balance of my flight as filed; transmitting on my main radio and listening on speaker. Immediately upon landing; I called the tower [at the last departure] reached the tower supervisor. He told me that the controller that had been on duty had left for the day. He was on duty. I identified myself and gave the reason for my call. He said that he knew nothing about any incident occurring that afternoon. No report had been passed on to him by the afternoon controller. He suggested that I call [on a specific date] as he would be on duty at that time. I did just that; called and reached a very unhappy [controller] and after starting to apologize and attempt to explain what I believe had happened; he told me that he had already filed his report. I said that I guess any further explanation would not be beneficial and terminated my call.In rethinking the chain of events that led up to my violation of ATC instructions; I submit the following:I wonder why the controller did not state that the airport would be closing in 15 mins when I called in on base leg stating that I was going to fuel. I had sufficient fuel onboard to fly to another airport. I do realize that he had no obligation to do so and that I should have known about this closure before hand.When I got the notification of this closure at the FBO while fueling; I should have remained in the office until I was informed that a departure had been approved and by whom. I was too eager to make my IFR departure clearance time slot. I should have asked for the tower phone number at that time; called and stated my request and asked for a departure clearance myself.After starting my taxi from the fuel pumps; I should have recognized a communication problem while on the ground by the fact that there were no transmissions of any kind to be heard. If an inoperative radio that prevented all communication; get it repaired before further flight. My emergency standby radio is just for that purpose… An in flight emergency. I could have moved a few pieces of luggage while on the ground; reached my spare headset and resolved this problem after troubleshooting.",,,,"The pilot of a C210 reported departing after airport closure due to miscommunication with local airport personnel and ATC.",

The enroute and arrival portion of our clearance was as follows: GMN TTE TTE.ALTTA8; cruising altitude 12;000. Just prior to TTE ATC cleared us to descend to 6;000; expedite through 10;000. While descending; we crossed TTE and got established on TTE.ALTTA8 arrival (course from TTE 323deg; minimum alt 3700). While descending on course at 7500 MSL ATC issued to us a low altitude alert; instructed to immediately turn left heading 270 and maintain 8000; and stated that we are below the MEA at our position. We complied; and upon ATC query confirmed that we are in VMC and have visual terrain clearance.After uneventful landing at our destination I called Fresno TRACON to find out why we were issued a low altitude alert while 2;800 feet above minimum altitude for the arrival segment. ATC said that our flight appeared to be 4-5 NM off charted arrival course where the minimum altitudes are in excess of 9;000 compared to 3;700 minimum arrival altitude. However; our flight instruments showed us established on the published arrival segment; which is why the low altitude alert was completely unexpected to us. The contributing factors may be the lack of navigational guidance the pilots have while operating in VOR cone of confusion at high altitudes as well as aircraft and ATC radar limitations and malfunctions. While I don't know what caused this situation; I think to prevent situations like these from happening require accurate tracking and procedural flying by the pilots; in this instance the alert issued by the ATC was consistent with ATC procedures due to their belief that the aircraft was off-course in a sector with higher MEAs/MVAs.",,,,"C210 instructor pilot reported receiving a low altitude alert from ATC when they had unknowingly deviated from their cleared track.",

Denver TRACON (D01) called when the aircraft was at 8;000 and asking if he could fly his present heading. The aircraft was 4000 feet below my Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA); so I asked if he was on a VFR climb; which D01 often does in these situations. They informed me he was not. I told them what my MIA's were in that area; they advised their MIA/MVA's were only 8;000 feet - but this aircraft would not be in their airspace for much longer; perhaps 8 miles. I advised them I couldn't approve that; at this point the aircraft was approaching my 11;000 feet MIA. They kept him on their frequency until he was at our MIA - which was not only beyond my boundary with D01 but into the next ZDV sector over (12).The D01 controller clearly was not aware of our much higher MIA's; which ranged from 11;000 to 12;000 on Aircraft X's course; and 13;000 just a few miles north of him - all of these MIA's extend into D01's airspace. This continues a pattern of D01 trying to get ZDV to accept or institute unsafe actions - whether it be telling us to turn aircraft into areas of known thunderstorms or situations like the one described above. It's clear from their actions and words; they care little (and possibly know less) about the airspace beyond their own boundaries. I guess recurrent training would be the only thing that might prevent a re-occurrence of events like this - or somebody actually doing something about this problem facility before they cause a serious incident or accident. It will happen sooner or later; and through these reports no one can say they weren't warned.Another concept worth considering is removing airspace from D01's authority. This particular Grand Junction approach control airspace was trimmed down recently (more given back to ZDV) due to D01's inability to see aircraft on radar on the west and south side of that airspace. From all accounts D01 is overstretched and understaffed; so perhaps ZDV should take back all of Grand Junction approach control's airspace - which was once the case.Side note; which you can consider or not: [Reports]; over the years; has been looked at as a 'get out of jail free' card; and when abused has caused zero accountability with some controllers and facilities. The going opinion of Denver TRACON is they are not held accountable for anything they do incorrectly - which is a near daily occurrence - and nothing will ever change or improve as they are the tail that wags the dog in this area. They basically can violate ZDV; safety; or anything else with impunity. The culture between ZDV and D01 is toxic; and that is no exaggeration. The controller ranks feel that our own ZDV management is complicit in this as nothing is seen to be done about D01's transgressions; or worse; blame is shifted back to the ZDV controller and D01 is never held accountable. I know I've only been doing this job for 31 years; but this is by far the worst situation I've seen in my career; and I did work at D01 at one time and have had to deal with them directly for the last 21 years.",,,,"Denver ARTCC Controller reported an unsafe situation with Denver TRACON having an aircraft below the Minimum IFR Altitude and attempting to hand it off to him.

The callout also advised us that they were not talking to the overtaking aircraft and that we should change altitude if necessary. The callout voice was not that of the controller handling us at the time (male callout; female controller)In less than 10 seconds we located the aircraft; a T-tail twin turboprop on a path which would result in a collision. When first sighted that aircraft was at our 10 o'clock. We pitched up hard and to the left in an attempt to pass over and behind the other aircraft. That aircraft executed a hard left descending turn which appeared to be almost 180 degree course reversal for it.The callout voice then said that another agency was talking to the twin turboprop. We continued on our prior course. [Three days later] I contacted LA quality assurance and asked a representative to look into the situation.The explanation received was that two controlling agencies operated in the same airspace between the altitudes of 13000 feet and 14000 feet MSL. The representative believes that SoCal was controlling the turbo prop while LA center was handling my aircraft. They went on to explain that in this event it was likely that the turbo prop was climbing fast enough that its location was initially blocked by the radars operating system so that its location was not available on my controllers screen until such time as the callout was made to me.My concern; aside from the general dislike of the idea of falling in a flaming mass of debris onto one of the world's great cities; is that there is nothing myself or the controller handling my aircraft could do differently. Without the callout voice (an instructor at LA center I'm told) it's very possible this could have resulted in collision. The pilot of the twin turbo prop as the overtaking converging pilot might have been able to see and avoid sooner but I suspect he also was counting on some notice from the agency controlling them.Without changes in the overlap of airspace and perhaps to the operating systems on the controllers screens this could happen again. It seems that a procedural change may be required here.",,,,"Pilot reported a traffic call from an unknown ATC Instructor voice.

It was towed from the interstate by tug up to the airport and hangared for the night.In the confusion and stress of the situation; and 'newness' of the airplane; I did not think of attempting to transfer fuel from the aux tank (the mains as it turned out were 'dry').

We took off for an ILS approach on Runway XY; then cancelled IFR to conduct traffic pattern work. I am in training for my CFI; therefore occupying the right seat; pretending to be the instructor conducting demonstration-performance for the traffic pattern VFR approach procedure. I did 3 landings with no issues; and after that we did positive change of controls; so he could play the role of the student flying and I would be the instructor; talking him through. It was a touch and go; and he did the landing; and subsequent takeoff roll with no issues. During the initial climb; at about 200 feet AGL the engine quit running. He was already flying so he did the landing straight ahead. I offered flaps; so we landed with flaps. The landing was made within the runway pavement. One runway light was broken. The main landing gear tires went bald due to the heavy braking. There were no other damages; nor injuries. Emergency personnel came to the site and assisted with removing the airplane out of the runway and checking on me and [my CFI]. We had no injuries.At the time we weren't positive on what caused the engine to fail. As soon as the airplane was brought back to the hangar; one of the mechanics started the engine and it ran. The mechanic then told us he would drain the tanks on the next [week].So; I received a text message from [my CFI] saying the mechanic drained the tanks and found no fuel on the left tank. On a phone call with the mechanic; I learned that the last person who flew the airplane did not refuel it because the FBO which does the refueling was closed. There were no notes or communication regarding that. As per club policy; every pilot must get the airplane refueled after each flight and annotate the amount of fuel in the airplane logbook. The reason [my CFI] and I didn't have any information that the airplane wasn't refueled was because the annotation was on the last line of the sheet which was detached from the logbook; as they are every calendar month for accounting purposes. [My CFI] and I started our flight on a brand new log sheet with no previous information about the airplane. I conducted my preflight inspection as I do every time with the C210; specifically the fuel check. There is a small ladder to climb; not tall enough to enable me to see the fuel tank opening from above (a visual inspection looking to the fuel tank opening from above is the ideal way to visually check for fuel quantity inside the tanks. There was no plastic tank fuel gauge stick available). I used my tactical sense (I put my finger inside the tank to feel the fuel); and I double checked with the fuel gauges; which were indicating full. With that I had no doubt we had fuel in the airplane. [My CFI] was not present at the time I did my preflight; but I told him how I did my preflight and my findings; to include fuel check. He accepted it; and we went flying. [My CFI] and I did not brief ourselves in who would be the PIC; as I had the assumption he was the PIC; since he was the CFI and the one allowed to fly the C T210L as per flying club policies; (I am not allowed to schedule the C T210L myself as I have not met all the training requirements yet); and he thought I was the PIC because I have more flight hours than he does. This event was an extremely sobering experience for me. I have always been a safety oriented pilot; but this experience has driven home to me the significance of visual; accurate and positive fuel inspection on preflight.",,"[Report narrative contained no additional information.]",,"CFI student pilot and instructor reported an engine failure during landing practice.

While 3/4 into our third survey line; heading north bound; the aircraft began to experience a sudden partial loss of power. I began to take corrective action first by verification that the fuel selector was selected on and the fullest tank. Secondly; I advanced the mixture control towards the full rich position; but had to back off as the engine experienced further roughness. I then checked each magneto; left and right; but no significant change was evident. Oil pressure and temps were at their normal operating range; as well as CHT. There was a significant drop of EGT indicated. At this point; I decided it would be in our best interest to make a pre-cautionary return to our remote base; as the corrective action I took had no positive effect. While we were en route to our remote base; I asked for a received priority handling and explained our situation to Center. While we were approximately 8 miles Southwest from ZZZ; we experienced a further loss of power to the point where we were unable to sustain level flight (began a gradual descent) I then [notified ATC] and set our squawk code to 7700 and hit direct to ZZZ on our Garmin 430 GPS; which was the nearest airport. I circled the approach end of runway 17 until we were at an altitude where I could make a safe approach to land. At approximately 1200' I selected the gear handle lever to the down position; but there was no mechanical response present. With not enough power to level off to go around and no leeway of time to attempt pumping the gear handle down manually (as we still were gradually losing altitude) I decided to prepare for a belly up landing and focused on making the landing as smooth as possible without making the situation worse. After crossing the threshold of runway 17; I selected the fuel selector to the off position; mixture to idle cutoff; and turned the magnetos off. We skidded to a stop approximately 500' past the second 1;000' runway hash marks. We evacuated the aircraft without any injuries as emergency personnel responded to the event.",,,,"Pilot conducting aerial survey work in a single engine aircraft reported an in-flight event of partial power loss resulting in a forced landing at a nearby airport.

Approach advised me that there was a King Air on an instrument approach to Runway 9; and cleared me for departure; 'void if not off in five minutes'. Although monitoring both frequencies; I overheard the King Air calling final on the approach; but did not hear the distance. Because of the short void time; I incorrectly assumed that the King Air was farther out and that I had a short time to depart. I switched frequencies and called a departure on Runway 9 over the CTAF; and rolled past the hold short markings to begin takeoff.

I selected gear down with the gear select handle.  The green gear-down light did not illuminate.I elected to divert to ZZZ and ran the emergency procedures checklist for landing gear malfunction.  This included utilizing the hand pump to manually pump the gear down.  To my surprise; upon exercising the hand pump; no resistance was felt.  This indicated to me an absence of hydraulic fluid in the gear extension system.With the aircraft flying at a suitable altitude on autopilot; I removed the cover panel from the right side of the center pedestal; and removed the dipstick for the hydraulic fluid reservoir.  It indicated no fluid present.  I then elected to attempt to fill the reservoir with the available liquid on hand; a 1-liter bottle of water.  I poured the entire bottle into the reservoir and exercised the hand pump; but still felt no resistance and was unable to lower the main gear into position.After notifying people on the ground by radio that I would likely need to execute a gear-up landing; and requesting that they notify the Fire Department to be on hand; I climbed to altitude and attempted several other procedures to bring the main gear legs forward and lock them into place.  None of these attempts were successful.I could see in the gear mirror that my nose gear was down and apparently locked.I returned to ZZZ; announced my intention to make an emergency gear-up landing on Runway XX; and executed a full-flaps landing at minimum airspeed.  On short final I elected to pull the mixture to full lean cutoff and turn off the engine ignition as well as the electrical system master.  After touchdown the aircraft rolled on its nose wheel and skidded on its tail tie-down ring; eventually leaning to the left whereupon contact with the asphalt runway was made by the left horizontal stabilizer and aft-most portion of the left wingtip fairing.  The aircraft came to a halt left of centerline but prior to exiting the paved surface of the runway.I exited the aircraft and walked around it to assess for the possibility of fire.  I saw none; and was also pleased to see that the propeller tips showed no signs of ground contact.  External damage appeared to be limited to gear doors; the main gear door fairing aft of the left main gear well; the left stabilizer and elevator; and a very minor scrape on the aft tip of the left wing fairing.  Hydraulic fluid was noted to be dripping from the area of the nose gear.  An aircraft mechanic on the scene noted the apparent separation of a hydraulic hose from its swaged fitting.  This hydraulic hose was connected to the nose gear door actuator.In retrospect I believe it is possible I could have averted the gear up landing by not touching the gear handle after I noticed the green gear-down-and-locked light had failed to illuminate.  In the system on this aircraft; the sequence of events is doors-open; gear-down; doors-close.  I glanced out my pilot-side window and saw a tire in position on the left main landing gear.  I don't know whether it was in position on the right but suspect now that it was.  I then tried to debug the system by cycling the gear handle; but if I had simply left it alone; I think the condition would have been gear down and locked; gear doors open; which would not have been problematic.  The hose that failed was on the door-closing side of the nose gear door actuator.  I now think of the green gear status light as a 'gear-sequence-concluded-and-doors-closed' indication; whereas before I used to equate it with 'gear-down-and-locked'.  It really doesn't mean that; gear down and locked occurs without that light illuminating necessarily.",,,,"C210 pilot reported a partial gear extended landing following an apparent hydraulic system failure.",

(Both right and left calipers had shown evidence of leaking hydraulic fluid; and it just made sense to replace the pads following caliper service.) A second purpose was to check the full power fuel flow to the engine which had also been adjusted.Taxi from the FBO ramp to [the runway] via A; C; D; and H was without incident and the brakes were tested. However; no high speed testing is possible while taxing an aircraft.Take off and flight were without incident; flew a short flight round trip to a local airport to obtain a straight-in to Runway 31. Fuel flow performance was fully verified on takeoff and during flight. The aircraft was cleared for straight in 31 approach about XA15 from roughly over the lake (west) with a final call required 5 miles straight-in. Final call was made about XA20 at 5 miles with clearance to land issued by the tower.Landing was uneventful - except for the gusty winds down the Runway. Hard breaking was applied at about taxiway G in order to 'speed-test' the brakes. The brakes grabbed as expected; and within seconds the right brake suddenly failed - probably about taxiway F. Immediate call was made to the tower stating the (right) brake had failed. Stopping and controlling the left-turn tendency of the aircraft became of major concern. At no time was control of the aircraft lost. The aircraft was at slow taxi speed by the time it entered the intersecting area of Runway 17/35 and 31/13; however; the aircraft did not want to turn to the right (into the wind); so rather than shut the aircraft down on the only useable runway; the aircraft was allowed to roll left onto and along Runway 17/35. A call was made to the tower that the aircraft would be 'shut down here and then towed.' With the aircraft now clear of Runway 31/13 and heading south along Runway 17/35; shut down of the engine was initiated. At this point in time; a wind gust 'weather-vaned' the aircraft off of the hard surface onto the grassy area on the east side of runway 17/35. Sufficient control of the aircraft was maintained so that the left main did NOT hit the 'yellow/orange' runway light located nearby. It should be noted that had braking been applied; the left brake action would have probably pulled the aircraft into the Runway light (plus the propeller was still 'windmilling') so the conscience decision was made to allow the aircraft to come to a halt on its own. The owner/operator knew by this time that no damage would occur to aircraft or Runway environment.Further inspection by mechanic and owner/operator showed no damage to the aircraft. Hydraulic fluid was leaking from the right caliper signifying a blown O-ring.",,,,"A C210 pilot conducted a post maintenance test flight following fuel control and brake maintenance.

The wheels appeared to be in; but the gear doors would not close. The checklist calls for lowering the gear and after obtaining a 'green light'; to return and land. I put the gear handle in the down position and the gear unlocked and fell out of the wheel wells but would not extend. Again; following the checklist I extended the emergency gear handle and attempted to extend the gear manually. After numerous attempts to pump the gear down over 1 1/2 hours I had what appeared to be a nose gear extended but not the mains. This aircraft has hydraulic flaps as well that use the same engine driven pump. The flaps operated normally and the reservoir was full. Analyzing the situation I determined that no amount of pumping would get the gear down and locked if it wouldn't operate on the fully functioning engine driven pump. I exhausted all the options listed in the checklist including cycling the gear numerous times to no avail.At this point with about one hour of fuel remaining I requested and received special handling from Tower. I made one pass to allow Tower personnel to inspect the gear from the outside. They confirmed that the mains were not fully extended.After one last attempt to pump the gear down I elected to retract the nose wheel and land gear up. On the second pass I touched down on centerline approximately 1500 ft from the approach end. The aircraft slid approximately 400 ft and came to rest straight ahead about 35 ft right of centerline.

I was told by my supervisor later that it was confirmed by tape review that the airspace was approved active by a controller working the previous day. Prior to Approach calling me; Aircraft X had flown through Restricted Areas A and B coming level at 13;000 feet. Prior to this incident; Aircraft Y departing climbing to 22;000 feet had been vectored to the west to accommodate traffic flow and may have violated the restricted airspace as well.I would recommend that coordination on this restricted airspace be done through the Operations Manager; Traffic Management Unit or Supervisor along with the controller's approval. Workload is a bit much to ask the controller on a sector to get two other sector's approval of releasing the airspace to Approach and inputting the information into the URET (User Request Evaluation Tool) all while working traffic on the sector.",,"I was Controller in Charge. Approach called over the shout line to coordinate Restricted areas altitudes from the surface to 22;000 feet. The procedure for this is Approach calls Center Sector 41 and coordinates the use of airspace. Center sector 41 will turn the airspace on for the center environment via EDST (En Route Decision Support Tool) which will automatically display on the Radar scopes. This particular instance Approach called for Center. The handoff Assist trainee picked up and mistakenly approved the request. As CIC (Controller in Charge) when this change happens I update the ESIS (Enhanced Status Information System) board in the area. I did not hear or was not made aware of this change. Restricted airspace was active but not displayed. Approach needs to be clear about calling the correct Center sector on the shout line. This event would have never transpired if they had done so.",,"ZME ARTCC Controller and a Controller in Charge reported aircraft were allowed to fly through Restricted Airspace due to faulty coordination.",

I'm instrument rated; current; but evidently not 100% proficient. I was flying along with GPSS enabled on the Aspen PFD; feeding from the Garmin 480 (#1 nav). About 4 miles before the Penn Cove VOR (CVV); ATC instructed me to fly to the VOR and fly outbound the 310 radial to intercept the YVR 145 radial. In my effort to tune and identify both stations; I got behind the airplane. By the time I got YVR tuned into my #2 Nav; I was already past the 145 radial and I had lost situational awareness. I flip-flopped the #1 nav to the YVR VOR and turned to intercept. But because I was task saturated; I didn't realize that I had twisted a 145 course (not a 325 course) into the Aspen. Further; I rotated the heading bug to make the aircraft turn to intercept a course of 145. I had lost situational awareness and failed to see the big picture (I knew; of course; that the YVR VOR was North West of my position; I just didn't incorporate that information). As I was in the turn; ATC asked me for my heading. I can't remember what it was; but in response they said 'Why are you going that way; that won't intercept the VOR.' At that point I confessed and complied; saying something like 'Well help me out; then please. What heading should I fly?' They gave me an on-course heading; I realized my mistake; tuned in the VOR correctly; and completed the remainder of the flight uneventfully. So what happened? Well; it was difficult to transition between the 480 as a GPS navigator and a nav radio. In retrospect; there are three things I could have done; one of which I know how to do off the top of my head; two of which I will/have looked up to improve my familiarity. 1) I should have had CVV dialed in as a backup. I think the principle of being able to 'step down the ladder' in terms of complexity is helpful; but not if you have to scramble to lookup frequencies; tune; identify; twist; etc. And I could even have had YVR as a cross radial already; knowing that it would add to situational awareness. All this even though I was on a flight plan on a capable GPS navigator. 2) Use Foreflight to get some more situational awareness. In this case; that was complicated a bit. I was using their new Jeppesen IFR low charts which doesn't show the navaid frequency or Morse ID; so I had to do more hunting. I could have input the radial intersection as a waypoint and seen a graphical display; but I didn't know how to do that at the time (it turns out you can enter with a series of slashes: CVV/310/YVR/145). That would have improved my situational awareness. 3) Use the GNS 480 to intercept a course off of a GPS fix. I know this can be done; but I have to lookup how. Things I did well: Ask ATC for help. Especially in single-pilot ops they are a great cross check (as they were here). They're quite good at pointing out errors/deviations; but they sometimes need to be nudged to provide help. Flying IFR is hard. I would have rather not have made this mistake; but I'm happy ATC called me out and helped me get back on course.",,,,"Cessna 210 pilot reported task saturation; losing situational awareness; deviating from course; and asking for assistance after the Controller asked why he had made a turn.

I checked to be certain that the gear and flaps were up. I was just a couple of knots below best angle speed.Several hours later I think I now understand what happened; it was operator error. The red light on my electric tach lit up; it often does this for a very small excursion over the limiting RPM. The proper way to deal with this is to adjust the propeller control. I now think that I must have been pulling back the throttle instead of the propeller control to keep the rpm below red line.This; I believe; would explain the loss of power. If I am correct; this was a clear error on my part. Unfortunately; I cannot think of a way to prevent such an error. I have way more than 1000 hours in the airplane and I am current in it.

The pilot requested to proceed inbound to land; but the field was below basic VFR minimums. I advised the pilot and he requested radar vectors. I responded that I was unable to provide radar vectors; and provided him with the frequency for Denver Approach. The pilot said he simply wanted to fly the ILS 'on his own' before turning inbound; to which I once again replied that the field was below basic VFR minimums. At that point; he advised he was changing frequencies over to Denver Approach.I then observed the aircraft acquire an IFR data block and listened in on the approach frequency as they established radar contact and began providing him radar service for an ILS approach. I observed Aircraft X climbing to 7000 ft as he turned onto the final.Aircraft X checked on outside of the final; level at 7000 ft for the ILS approach. I provided the pilot with the latest pilot report and weather conditions and cleared him to land. Before the aircraft passed the FAF; I observed it below 7000 ft and the low altitude alert sounded. I immediately issued the low altitude alert to the pilot and he acknowledged. The approach controller was simultaneously calling so I could not hear the pilot's response. On the second try; the pilot confirmed he was 'correcting back to 7000 ft' for the approach. I did not see him reach 7000 ft again; but I did see that he stopped his descent on the final and did not need to issue any additional alerts. The pilot continued inbound and landed without further incident.Continuous pilot and controller training on these kinds of situations can help prevent re-occurrences of this event. What are your options as an airman if you're operating VFR but trying to land at a controlled airport reporting conditions below Basic VFR? I suspect the pilot may have desired a SVFR (Special VFR) clearance; but did not seem to understand what steps he would need to take to initiate the request. After picking up an IFR clearance; the pilot may have also initiated a request for a contact approach if he wanted to remain clear of the clouds as he turned inbound. However; without exercising one of those options; I was not expecting him to descend like he did prior to the FAF.As always; pilots should always keep in mind if they are encountering an emergency situation; controllers may issue a clearance into the airspace for landing; after confirming that an emergency exists.",,,,"BJC Tower Controller reported issuing an aircraft a low altitude alert after it descended below the FAF crossing altitude.",

I was in the left seat. We had waited about 2 hours for the ceilings to lift above 1000 feet so that we would have visual conditions if we were to have an engine failure. My mechanic had flown my Cessna for about 0.5 hours the previous day to do an initial check-out of the newly overhauled engine that he had installed. We climbed VFR until we passed through a broken layer of clouds starting at 1200 feet with tops at 7200 feet and entered a holding pattern while in contact with ATC at 8000 feet. Traffic increased so ATC had us hold north east at 9000 feet. During almost the entire time we were; as intended; within gliding distance of four other airports based on looking at the ForeFlight glide range display. I did note that I was not holding altitude as well as I would like with deviations up to 200 feet; probably from not flying for nearly 8 months. Fuel flow was much higher than I expected as I had to keep the mixture richer than the aircraft manual flow numbers to keep cylinder head temperatures below 400 degrees.We discussed a practice instrument approach; but thought it would put us too far from our destination since our fuel levels were low; and we would need to use lower engine power levels that were recommended by the break-in procedure; so we requested direct. I thought we were on the fullest fuel tank at that time. ATC vectored us further east than we desired before turning us toward the runway a little north of the ILS approach. I should have cancelled IFR and kept high enough to be within gliding range an airport at all times. Flying the ILS certainly does not provide that margin. Instead; I even let myself drop 400 feet lower than the ATC requested altitude while looking for the airport. We were slightly above the glide slope and north far enough that the localizer needle was fully deviated to the left inbound on a Visual Approach. We had the gear extended with an airspeed of about 140 knots (higher than normal 120 knots as break-in procedure specified keep power above 65% if possible and to reduce power slowly).Somewhere about a mile out from the airport; we both thought we heard a little pop; and the engine stopped producing power. There was no response to the throttle; so I pulled the prop back to full coarse pitch; and my friend raised the gear to increase our glide ratio. I raised the nose slightly to reduce speed to about 85 knots (a little over no wind best glide speed; but we had a slight headwind). I was very concerned that we would not make it over the embankment on the west side of the highway; but we managed to clear it by [about] 40 feet. I turned left to avoid the structure supporting the approach lights; remembered to switch fuel tanks; and then leveled the wings for landing. There was no time to extend the gear so I just landed with the gear up; roughly about 35-45 seconds after the engine stopped producing power. The landing did not seem much rougher than some landings I have had on rough gravel strips many years ago. Neither of us had any physical injuries at all.Fuel flow rates during a break-in procedure may need to be much higher than even the rich of peak expected fuel flows in the aircraft manual in order to keep cylinder head temperatures below the levels that cause cylinder damage. Fuel flow rates were roughly twice the fuel flow rate I use when flying lean of peak with my GAMIjectors. I remembered to switch tanks too late as I assumed it was the newly overhauled engine that had failed. I thought we had switched tanks before leaving the holding area; but apparently I did not because the left tank I switched to had about 10 gallons showing on the fuel gauge and the right tank fuel gauge showed empty when the FAA requested the engine installer to check the fuel after the aircraft was towed back to the hangar. Had I switched fuel tanks immediately after the engine stopped producing power; perhaps the engine would have fired back up in time to prevent my off runway landing if the empty left tank was really the problem. I also forgot to turn the master switch off and crack the aircraft doors before landing. In the future; I will have the emergency procedures memorized before flying because I only had seconds to make decisions.Verbalize checklists while high enough above the ground to allow configuration changes. With another pilot in the adjacent seat; have that pilot verify the configuration matches the checklist. Stay within predicted glide range to an airport with about a 500 feet vertical margin when doing an engine break-in procedure so you are guaranteed to make the runway in the case of a complete engine failure. It also gives the extra time to diagnose what the problem might be. In the case of my aircraft; it is easy to slip it with full flaps and gear down as needed to lose altitude once it is guaranteed that you can make the runway.",,"The flight was with owner of aircraft to break-in a newly overhauled engine. The owner was flying. We spent about 2 hours flying large holding patterns above several airports in the area; trying to stay within gliding distance of an airport. We did not trust the new engine. About an hour and a half into the flight; I realized we were down to about an hour of fuel remaining; since we were running at very high power and full rich for the break in. My personal habit is to always be on the ground when fuel gets down to an hour; and I explained this to the owner/pilot. For some reason; I let him convince me it was 'OK' and we did one more holding pattern; then got vectors back to the home base for an ILS approach. When we made the decision to continue; an airport with fuel available was right below us in VFR conditions. Why didn't we land and get gas? Because we were focused on the engine break-in! We also could have canceled IFR; since we were in VMC; and simply entered the pattern at the home airport. But instead; we let ATC give us long vectors to a Visual Approach.On Final; about 1 mile from the runway threshold; there was a 'pop' and the engine stopped producing power. We both assumed it was a failure of the new engine; and proceeded with an engine-out landing. The airport is on top of a small [hill]; and we were gliding for impact with the embankment well short of the runway. So; we agreed to raise the gear to improve our glide angle; and pull the prop control back to reduce drag. We cleared the embankment by less than 50 feet; just missed the approach lights for the runway; and came to a stop after skidding 300 feet; and only 600 feet short of the threshold. The time from the 'pop' sound to coming to a stop gear-up on the dirt and grass was no more than 45 seconds. Maybe even only 30 seconds. Neither of us was hurt at all. It has not been determined was caused the power loss. Maybe a mechanical problem? May running a tank dry?How to prevent this? Nearly all of our focus was on performing the engine break-in; which caused us to ignore simple; basic flying practices; like having lots of fuel. We didn't even keep the idea of not trusting the engine at the front of our minds; on final approach; we could have come in at a much steeper angle so a glide to the runway was assured; but instead we flew a 'standard' ILS.",,"C210 pilot and flight instructor reported landing short of the runway due to mismanagement of the fuel system.",

Prior to the flight I determined there was plenty of fuel available. After some take-offs and landings at a local airport; I climbed to 6500' and contacted Approach for advisories while I knew I would be somewhat distracted. I again confirmed adequate fuel but decided I should switch tanks when heading back to base. The tests went smoothly and I turned to head home; descending to 3500' and forgetting to switch tanks. Just east of ZZZ1 the engine stopped. I immediately turned back to ZZZ1; advised ATC of the problem and began trouble shooting. Finally I checked the fuel gauges and realized my error. Switched tanks and the engine soon recovered. Resumed the flight to base and landed without further issue; landing with well more than legal minimums.My take away--anything other than flying the airplane should be more than a solo activity.

SoCal Approach however cleared me for the visual approach. I took off the sight-limiting device and turned inbound. Approach asked if we had the airport in sight. This is where the problems started. While I had previously flown into HHR a few times at night; [I] wouldn't call myself overly familiar; my instructor had even less experience with this airport and its visual sight picture at night. HHR can be hard to make out in the sea of light that is Los Angeles. However; there is a kink in a freeway that runs next to it; which helps to visually acquire the field. On the night in question however; ATC had vectored me much further east than I would normally fly visually and I mistook another similar looking kink in the freeway for the one is was looking for.Although not 100% sure I actually 'had' the airport; I started a descent. At about 500 feet this [elicited] a 'low altitude' warning from the Approach Controller who then handed me off to Tower. Incredibly; the same situation happened again; this time with a 'low altitude' warning from Tower until I finally got sight of the airport. Having climbed back to pattern altitude; I was too high for a stabilized approach at this point and elected to go around and land. The subsequent landing was uneventful.I think the problem was caused by a combination of factors. One was a certainly fatigue after having flown several hours 'under the hood'. Second was the unexpected visual approach clearance and the transitioning from flight on instruments to visual flight. Third was the false sense of familiarity (the freeway 'kink') that led me to think I knew where I was. Lesson learned: even on a visual approach; keep flying the instruments. The disorienting moment came after taking off the 'hood' and it went downhill (quite literally) from there.

The route is between ELP Class C airspace and restricted area 5103A. I attempted to maintain altitude between 5;000 and 7;000 feet. I had good ground contact visibility and flight visibility of estimated 3-5 miles. ELP was reporting scattered at 7;000 and broken at 9;000 with 3 miles visibility with blowing dust. ADS-B weather was showing improving weather and both LRU and DMN were reporting clear.Since the shortest route was ahead I decided to continue and not reverse course. As I neared the EWM VOR both my Garmin GTN 750 and 480 GPS receivers lost all satellite reception. My Garmin portable with panel mounted antenna continued to receive satellite reception and I used it for navigation. It also lost reception briefly about 5 miles west of EWM; but reestablished quickly. I tried to contact ELP approach but was unable. At approximately 10 miles West of EWM sky conditions were clear and visibility was unlimited. I landed at [my destination] and when my wheels touched down both Garmin receivers regained satellite reception. I have flown this route many times over the past 15 years and never lost satellite reception. The Garmin equipment is 4 years old and software was updated [very recently.] I have never experienced total loss of satellite reception before. I have flown with this equipment over the entire US; Alaska and the Caribbean. I checked my track on the Garmin portable 560 and it appears that I did not enter Class C or R-5103A; but because of possible navigational error I may have entered the air space. I have extensive experience in electronics and have a FCC commercial operator license. I believe the problem was caused by static electricity build up on the airframe; since the problem resolved on touch down and the portable GPS receiver was not effected since the antenna was inside the aircraft. Had I been on a RNAV approach this loss could have signal could have caused an accident. I did attempt to switch to VOR navigation; but the combination of turbulence and close proximity to the VOR made using the NAVAID difficult.If static electricity caused the loss navigation and location reporting with ADS-B this will be a serious issue when GPS nav is our only option.","Pilot advised  Garmin did not have an answer. Garmin assumed like the reporter that the cause of the problem was static build up. A build up of dust was also found on the aircraft after the flight which the reporter washed off after landing. Reporter hopes that this report will help others who may encounter the same problem.",,,"Cessna 210 pilot reported losing GPS signal while flying; and attributed the loss to possible static electricity.",

Tower asked if I had the other aircraft in sight; and I responded 'affirmative.' Tower told us to contact ZZZ Tower; as that was our destination. I changed the frequency in my radio but had not contacted ZZZ Tower yet. Shortly after that I thought to myself 'If I'm going to catch the other aircraft; I better speed up.' However my hand was still on the throttle; and the throttle was pushed all the way in. I looked at my manifold pressure gauge and was only indicating 20 inches of manifold pressure. I jockeyed the throttle a few times with no change in engine power output or manifold pressure. At this time I was about at a 45 for left base for a landing at ZZZ. I flipped the frequency back to ZZZ Tower and requested a 'Priority Landing; please!' That was obviously granted. I made a turn for the numbers and had enough speed to lower the landing gear and two notches of flaps. On final approach I glanced at manifold pressure gauge and saw 15 in Hg.

There were four wires to the speaker; I advised him to remove those wires and secure them and connect new wiring from the audio panel to the speaker. After completion of our work; the aircraft owner was on a flight and experienced an alternator failure (which was determined to be due to a failed alternator ground wire unrelated to the work we performed). While the aircraft was being repaired at a shop at the destination airport; the facility found the gear warning and stall warning horns were inoperative. I advised the aircraft's manager that I thought the gear/stall warning system was unrelated to the work our mechanic performed.

We checked the NOTAMS and knew the ILS and radar were out of service.  We had no external pressures. Our mission was just to build some instrument time; and do a couple of IFR approaches and enjoy the world of aviation. We departed for ZZZ. There was a stratus ceiling which we enter at about 1;900 to 2;000 ft. and broke out at 4;000 ft. to a well-defined top and a beautiful blue sky above and leveled off at 5;000 ft. I teach normal operating procedures; flight standards; and the special areas of interest the FAA feels are important that cause pilots to fly airplanes into the ground. In instrument flying I teach the importance of not letting yourself get crowed.  That means getting the weather as soon as possible; building the approach; briefing the approach from the IAP to the holding pattern; and then checklist.  80 miles from ZZZ; we had received the ATIS information and a minute later he had built the RNAV approach to Runway XX. He briefed the approach.We left cruise altitude and descended to 2;000 ft. to begin the RNAV approach. We have two Garmin 430's WAAS equipped GPSs; a Garmin MX-20; a 2500 Aspen and were being vectored 120 degrees heading from the west to the Runway XX approach. We also have a three axis autopilot which was engaged HDG; and GPSS indicating that the autopilot is in NAV mode. It is not the greatest autopilot in the world; but still better than nothing. We had gone from enroute; to terminal on the Garmin and was looking for it to enter approach mode. We were 25 miles from ZZZ; the weather was VFR and I could see the airport. Pilot had the airplane slowing down and he was at approach speed and approach intercept altitude before we intercepted the final course inbound to the final approach fix. He had his NAV display correct to capture the approach course inbound. I cautioned that the autopilot is older and to be sure that it intercepts the final course approach.  I have seen it miss capturing before.  He knows you can assign tasks to your automatics and even your copilot; but you cannot assign the responsibility. This is where the adventure begins. Sure enough it is going to fly through the NAV course inbound; so I lifted up the right wing and told the student to just disconnect the autopilot and have fun and fly the approach. We picked up LPV on the Garmin and I looked down at the glass and we had no glideslope or LOC type information on the PFD; so I just asked the student to remove the view limiting glasses and fly the PAPI. I teach pilots to say positive rate after they rotate so gear up can be commanded; and if glide slope is alive to say 'gear down landing checklist'. At this point; the student is flying really well.  He is right on the center-line and on the PAPI; his manifold pressure was 17'; his airspeed was 80 kts.; and his pitch was -2.5 which was exactly what I would expect. I knew exactly where I was; but I had been distracted and had lost situational awareness and I didn't know it. I am actually impressed with how well [student] is flying.He is commanding his airplane and it is obeying him. When flying big airplanes your flaps will have a gate that restricts the pilot from going from a maneuvering flaps setting to a landing flaps setting. There is a reason for that.  It allows him to get the gear down before he puts out all the landing flaps. If this is overlooked he will get a very annoying gear warning horn. I tested the Cessna 210's landing gear warning horn before the trip and it worked.  It is not as annoying as a FAR 121 aircraft; but it worked. We did not hear a gear warning horn. Our Bose noise canceling headsets blocked the warning from us.

At the time of this incident; I had 775 hours in type (in this particular aircraft); 997 hours total time in retractable gear aircraft; and 1560+ hours flight time logged. This gear up landing is a first time event for me; I have never before had even an 'almost' gear up landing incident or event. I have no good excuses for what happened; I have been thoroughly trained and practiced religiously; without fail (I thought); in my 1560+ hours of total flight time to always do a PRE-LANDING CHECKLIST from memory (or paper); as well as an ON FINAL CHECKLIST from memory. But once I realized that a gear up landing had taken place; I knew that I had not done either in this instance. I have no good excuse or reason why that did not happen in this instance; but on reflection; I realize that several factors may have contributed to the incident.Background on the events leading up to this occurrence. My plan for the day was to fly from ZZZ1 to ZZZ and pick up another pilot there; then take off and fly from ZZZ to ZZZ2 via the transition to ZZZZZ. Later in the day; I was going to return from ZZZ2 to ZZZ1 as the other pilot was going to be picking up his C210 at ZZZ2. I had filed flight plans and obtained weather briefings using Foreflight for the two initial planned segments: planning to depart ZZZ1 at XA:30 am local; and then ZZZ at XB:00 am - but time was not critical for anyone involved. The weather was solid VFR (6+ mile visibility and unlimited ceiling); with light surface winds from the west or northwest. Local sunrise was at about XA:30 am. I had called ahead to the FBO at ZZZ1 and my aircraft was out of the hangar on the northwest side of the field and on the ramp when I arrived at XA:15 am; about 10 minutes later than expected. My normal preflight inspection (- 20 minutes) was uneventful; the fuel tanks had been topped off after the previous flight (approx. 121 gal. on board).I started up; did a run up; called Ground and picked up my clearance and taxied to Runway XXR for takeoff. After a normal takeoff and contacting Approach; I proceeded direct towards ZZZ; a short flight - about 10 - 15 mins; I had planned to fly at 2;000 feet MSL but after a frequency change with Approach as I approached the river; ATC requested that I not go above 1;500 feet. Once on course; I was heading almost directly into the bright sun on a clear VFR day; I had expected that during my preflight analysis; but the sun was very bright and impeded forward visibility much more than expected - so I was splitting time watching for potentially conflicting traffic out the window (squinting) and on the ADS-B display inside. Approach did not call any traffic for me. After crossing the river; Approach requested me to report ZZZ in sight. I did not immediately spot the ZZZ field; but then did as I turned to the south and began a descent to enter a left base approach to ZZZ; Approach authorized a frequency change. I switched to the CTAF for ZZZ and made an initial approach announcement for Runway XY at ZZZ - no responses heard. Normally; I put the gear down; and verify that the gear is down and locked using both the 'down' green light on the panel and the gear inspection mirrors under the wings at no later than this point - at or during a final descent to the landing pattern altitude close to the airport or upon entry into the pattern. For unknown reasons I failed to do that then or later. Perhaps one reason for that failure is that because I knew I had full fuel; and had planned before take-off not to switch fuel tanks on this short flight. So I did not begin or do the usual Fuel - Undercarriage Checklist call out at that point. Why I don't know: I did put the mixture control full in and propeller control full forward.Just before turning onto final for Runway XY; I made a second CTAF announcement; nothing heard. I went from flaps 10 to20 to 30 degrees on final approach and had a stable descent; well lined up approach - initially slightly high; but very controlled. There was a very slight crosswind from the left on final approach; but it was minimal and corrected for with a very slight crab angle. For unknown reasons I again did not do my standard oral Fuel - Undercarriage call out on the final approach as I had failed to do at my normal Pre-Landing Checklist point of descent to the pattern altitude. Why I didn't do that I do not know! I have done these steps routinely on thousands of landings in retractable gear aircraft; and I do them routinely even when flying in fixed gear aircraft.Touch down was very close to center line (about 15 in. off) and lined up straight down the runway. Right about the time of the touch down; I realized something was not right; the aircraft attempted a slight tip to the left which I corrected for with slight right rudder/ aileron; initially thinking that there might be a tire problem (blowout) with the left main tire; a short moment later; I realized the attitude / position of the aircraft relative to the runway was considerably lower than normal and simultaneously noticed bent tips in the still rotating prop blades (due to strike on the runway surface). Oh [expletive] I called out; thinking how did I possibly do this? Nevertheless; I concentrated on controlling the aircraft as it slid down the runway on its belly. Realizing that I had just done a gear up landing; I thought (instinctively; but stupidly - without adequate thought) that I should try to move the aircraft toward the side of the runway to minimize blockage of the runway; and used a slight amount of rudder to do that. The aircraft came to rest at the edge of the runway; partially on and partially off of the paved runway surface. The good news. I was the only one in the aircraft; I suffered no injury and did not even feel bumping or abrupt aircraft movements - almost felt like a smooth; normal landing- except for the initial bump(s) when the prop blades struck the runway. The aircraft remained under control on the runway and slid smoothly forward; if l had a 'do over'; I would have kept the ground slide path on the centerline. Moving the aircraft to the side of the runway accomplished nothing (and potentially could have caused damage had the aircraft departed from the runway - it didn't) - the runway still had to be closed. The aircraft wings never touched the runway or the ground and there is no (apparent) breakage or cracking of any fuel; hydraulic or oil line or component(s); no dripping or leakage from the aircraft. Later in the morning the aircraft was raised by a large crane with two slings; one just aft of the front gear door and the other just aft of the main gear wheel wells. Once the aircraft was raised by the crane; its landing gear was lowered and locked down using the aircraft's electric hydraulic system which was still functioning. The aircraft was then towed to a tie-down; using a normal aircraft tow bar and airport tractor. As already noted; I have no good excuse for not doing my two 'normal' oral - out loud/ memory checklists (Pre-Landing and On Final); either of which would have caught the 'gear up' condition in time to prevent this incident. I have done both of those checklists thousands of times on thousands of landings. I think some possible contributing 'human factors' may have been: (1) I was running about 15 minutes late - although time was not critical in any respect - this may have been in the back of my mind and perhaps made me feel hurried; (2) flying almost directly into the sun (although I have done it many times; and anticipated it for this flight) on a such short flight was quite distracting - and continued until I turned south and started descending to pattern altitude - the time when the first checklist should have been done; but wasn't; (3) the ATC request that I remain at 1;500 ft. meant I was just slightly above normalpattern altitude for ZZZ; in retrospect; that factor speeded up the approach once the airport was spotted from the beginning because the normal; expected approach profile which would have allowed additional time that was not available to me for this approach; (4) while I am not and have never been dependent upon the 'gear up' warning horn and have only rarely heard it during intentional 'gear up'' descent maneuvers at altitude; I did not hear the 'gear up' warning horn during this approach and landing (I don't know; but suspect it might not have functioned); and (5) in looking through my logged time during the past three months to answer a reporting form question; I realize I have flown less during the last three months (due to an unusual busyness with other matters); than I have at any similar period during the past 8 years; however; I regarded myself as 100% current; proficient; well rested; etc. for this particular flight. Less than two weeks earlier I had flown a series of instrument approaches (with full exercise and use of the landing gear on each approach and missed approach) for 2.7 hours with a flight instructor - no problems or potential problems noted with checklists; call outs or handling of the landing gear. I have undergone considerable flight training during the past three years; obtaining new pilot ratings as well as multiple flight instructor ratings; and I have been actively working toward [my] last rating.I have had considerable mental turmoil trying to figure out how this happened - and so far; the above is the best I can do. I have consistently gone to great lengths to keep myself well trained and proficient; and I have never considered myself to be a reckless; careless or non-diligent pilot or aircraft owner in any respect. The damaged aircraft is repairable; and I plan to have it repaired and made airworthy again; and I plan to continue flying. But this unexpected incident has given me a lot to think about: I intend to continue to seek advice and counsel from experienced flight instructors and experienced pilots on all aspects of flying. Hopefully; I will not have another such mistake or error.",,,,"Cessna 210 pilot reported a gear up landing.",

When I leveled off at 9;500 ft. I noticed an indication on some of the imaging equipment indicating low voltage. Thinking I was dealing with a software problem; I started troubleshooting. The equipment is only linked to the airplane by the alternator; which charges it. After my attempts to fix what I thought were a problem with the imaging equipment failed; I turned my attention back to the panel. My scan showed a discharge indication on the alternator. My next reaction was to verify that I was below gear extension speed; and lower the gear lever. The landing gear only extended about halfway down. I ran through the checklist; and pumped the gear down manually. Although I had followed the procedure; I was not getting a green light due as there was not enough power to illuminate it. I headed toward ZZZ2; and called the tower on my cell phone. We arranged a low pass; and everyone in the tower cab agreed they were down and locked. I then climbed out and held over the ZZZ2's VOR. I again reviewed the checklist and everything in the POH; as well as a few 210 training manuals I keep in the airplane. My knowledge of these airplanes told me that if I had followed the procedure; the gear should be down. As a precaution; I called an A&P familiar with 210s; and he agreed that this was the case after conferring with several other people. At that point; I called ZZZ2 Tower again; and was cleared for an uneventful; no-flap landing. After some ground troubleshooting; it was confirmed that the alternator was the likely cause. A replacement alternator seems to have fixed the issue.Contributing Factors;The failure of the low voltage warning lightMy unfamiliarity with the aerial survey equipment; which could have been used as a backup voltmeter. The low voltage indication I was looking at was indicating that the survey equipment was not receiving power from the airplane.My fixation on troubleshooting individual problems; rather than recognizing an alternator failure immediately.This is a valuable lesson; as a similar chain of events could have led to a dangerous situation in IMC. For example; a pilot with a vacuum failure might fixate on troubleshooting a vacuum driven autopilot; and be in an unusual attitude before recognizing the true nature of the situation. It is better to assume the cause of a problem is the worst possible answer; and work backward from there. Useful Lessons;Cell phones are a valuable tool. While a handheld radio is great; unless you have one that can be wired to a headset it is loud; and the range usually isn't great. A cell phone works just as clearly as a radio; and once paired with a bluetooth headset requires no additional input. Controllers are more than willing to help work a problem. I was very impressed with how everyone in the Palm Springs Tower handled the situation.Keep a backup battery to power cell phones with you. I did; but many people are in the habit of charging off of a receptacle in the airplane. Keeping a good scan going is important.",,,,"Pilot reported that an alternator failure resulted in a diversion.",

I immediately descended to below 3;000 ft MSL. I continued below the Class C. Once clear I began my climb while entering the pass. The primary cause of this incident was my inattention to situational awareness and allowing the aircraft to climb while engaged with a passenger in the aircraft who was having difficulty dealing with the light turbulence. Contributing factors included the aircraft not being trimmed for level flight; the Class C air space ending very near the mountains and requiring entry into the pass at an altitude 1;500 ft. below the mountain ridge height; which causes a desire to climb as you approach the mountains. This pass is narrow and rugged. As a pilot we desire to have as much altitude and horizontal space as possible to turn back toward lower terrain. The mountains rise rapidly from the valley floor; approximately 3;500 ft. in one mile. The ground in the pass is rugged and unsuitable for a forced landing. The Class C airspace in this area is not generally used for traffic at BUR except when wind conditions are out of the North.

While entering into a 45 degree entry into the downwind for the southerly facing runway; ATC asked if I could enter into an immediate base leg entry for the northerly runway due to a reported wind shift. I accepted the change and entered into a short base leg for a short final approach on the northerly runway heading. When I estimated that I could make the runway; I pulled the power to idle and the engine abruptly stopped. With only about 300 ft. of altitude remaining; I felt I might be able to make the extended runway and notified ATC of the engine out condition. In order to avoid collision with the runway approach lights; I swerved to the side of the runway heading and back to the runway for a hard very low speed landing. After quickly realizing taxiing on the runway will soon become a problem due to the engine out; I noticed the low fuel boost pump toggle switch was still on; and likely caused the engine to flood at idle power. I turned off the low boost fuel pump; and the remaining wind spinning the propeller started up the engine immediately. I proceeded to taxi to the ramp without further incident.I believe that a simple LED illumination on the dash to indicate that the fuel boost pump is still activated would have helped avoid the engine out situation. Needless to say; the landing checklist has been updated and I am having an LED indicator installed in the central dash to indicate when the fuel boost pump is active; as it is seldom; if ever; used.Subsequently; about 10 days after the landing I have been contacted by [organization] about a potential strike to a runway identifier light.

This event occurred after departing ZZZ1. The smell and the puff of smoke was noted approximately 18nm Southwest of ZZZ2 while enroute to ZZZ3 airport. The cockpit did not fill with smoke nor were any flames ever observed. However; the aircraft instrumentation indicated a loss of electrical current from the aircraft's alternator. In an abundance of caution and to ascertain the source of the smoke; I immediately turned off the master switch and all electrical equipment and began a VFR decent for the closest airport; ZZZ4 some 12nm to the Northwest. During this decent; there was no additional smoke noted. Furthermore; the amount of smoke was never such as to limit visibility or breathing and did not require a window or door to be opened.

I did hear a plane ask how can you hear this radio and the reply by someone else was 5 by 5. As normal the landing light of our aircraft was on during the initial XX approach; and I confirmed it on the XY approach.  The PIC (Pilot in Command) (under the hood) announced our position as we reached the shoreline and communicated that we were on the XY approach and circle to land. At the circle to land altitude (700 ft.) I saw an aircraft to the left side and 100-200 above going the opposite direction. We turned to the right and continued downwind at the circling altitude and executed a full stop landing. We discussed the near miss. As we taxied for take-off I heard an aircraft in the pattern ask for a radio check; then we took off to ZZZ1 and landed.During our debrief at ZZZ1 we confirmed that neither of us heard the radio call of the aircraft departing ZZZ.  I was looking out for aircraft as we descended to the circling height but did not see the aircraft until we were 1-2 miles from the end of Runway XY.  The other aircraft did have flashing landing lights and was a low-wing two-seater.A contributing factor was also the low and bright sun angle to right on final and the shadows and trees to the left putting the opposing aircraft in the ground clutter.  No idea how we both missed a call from the departing aircraft. We could hear aircraft traffic and the Tower clearly as we departed ZZZ and flew to ZZZ1. ZZZ is often used for IFR practice and training.  There are two RNAV approaches that are useful in maintaining proficiency. The RNAV XY circle to land is particularly realistic and also does not fly low over homes. The airport is also used for primary training and has a popular restaurant.

XA00. Climbed to approximately 2;000 feet MSL; 1;500 feet AGL and encountered a ruptured hydraulic line (approximately 5 minutes into flight) spewing pressurized hot fluid onto pilot's right foot causing burns through footwear. After assessing engine performance; pilot attempted to lower landing gear. The gear failed to operate. Performed fly-by at ZZZ to have a lineman perform a visual inspection of the gear. He stated it was not down. Pilot squawked 7700 and [requested priority handling] on 121.5. ATC handed pilot to ZZZ approach for better comms. Climbed to approximately 4;500 feet MSL and diverted to ZZZ (longer and wider runway than ZZZ1 and fire service on field). Pilot attempted to use checklists to perform emergency landing gear lowering. The full POH was in the airplane; but was inaccessible to the pilot. Condensed spiral bound checklist being used did not contain the procedures. Pilot attempted to the use the emergency hand pump to lower the gear; but operated the hand pump improperly. Pilot was unable to get the gear to lower. Pilot made safe 'belly' landing at ZZZ. No injury to pilot. The aircraft did not sustain substantial damage. Prop strike and belly skin damage only. The catastrophic system failure could have potentially been overcome by with the hand pump; but there is no assurance that all three gear would have been successfully locked. Upon ruptured hydraulic line; discovered by right foot burning; pilot feared it may have been engine oil and that he was about to lose the engine. It took about 10 seconds to determine the engine appeared to be running properly and that the gear would not cycle. Pilot feared something worse may have occurred in the engine compartment causing the line to rupture (fire; etc.). Pilot determined the best course of action was to make a landing as soon as possible. As previously stated; pilot did not have access to the full POH as it was in the rear baggage compartment; out of safe reach. With limited time in type; pilot was unable to recall the proper emergency gear procedure. While this was an unfortunate incident; the pilot has many take aways from the event: 1) Ensure the full POH is accessible to the pilot. 2) Ensure understanding of landing gear system and procedures prior to flight .3) Consider use of cell phone or airplane radio to request the assistance of related to emergency operations.4) Consider recency of dual instruction received when flying unfamiliar aircraft.",,,,"Pilot reported a ruptured hydraulic line the cockpit resulted in a gear up landing.

Aircraft sustained no damage on landing and on inspection appeared to have a piston rod extending from a crankcase hole at the base of the number 2 and 4 cylinders. On the incident morning at XA26 the Pilot in Command and Pilot not Flying (Certified Flight Instructor) departed ZZZ1 on an IFR flight plan We were operating Aircraft X. The purpose of the mission was to fly to ZZZ2 to pick up patients to ZZZ1. The patients were to transfer to another aircraft to transport them to their destination in the ZZZ3 area. At XA00 we picked up our IFR clearance and took off via the ZZZ1 departure. On climb out passing 12;500 feet at approximately XA42 we noticed a gradual loss of Manifold Pressure (MP) to 24 inches with no apparent loss of power. I initially did not request priority handling since I had experienced this loss before and thought it was just a failure of the turbo charger waste gate spring and requested diversion to the ZZZ4 Airport for our mechanic to look into. Shortly thereafter; the engine appeared to start running rough and missing occasionally. I then requested change of destination to ZZZ1. The engine roughness and missing intensified and I noticed the oil pressure drastically drop to 10 inches. We attempted to shut down the engine with mixture to fuel cutoff; but the engine continued to smoke and produce power. I then turned the fuel selector to off. While this was going on; I [requested priority handling] with approach control and told them we were landing at ZZZ. We continued to monitor ZZZ approach control and started transmitting on ZZZ common traffic advisory frequency stating our engine out and our intentions to land on Runway XX. Landed at XA57. After landing we were able to coast to taxiway Delta and clear the runway. We were then towed by [the FBO] to their hangar to investigate the engine problem.

MSL to the 2;000 initial approach altitude as early as requested and it led to a faster descent and speed than planned. As a result; the approach was much more hurried than normal; to comply with an expedited descent request and some communications difficulties between me and ZZZ Center and ZZZ Tower. All of this resulted in me arriving at the initial approach fix (ZZZZZ) on altitude faster than desired. I also wasn't sure if the ZZZ Tower expected me to fly the hold in lieu of procedure turn. I didn't think they expected that I would; which kind of made sense to me since my vector to ZZZZZ was very close to the approach course. When I looked at the approach chart I saw the notation that the hold in lieu of procedure turn wasn't required; but did not confirm this with the ZZZ Tower Just before reaching ZZZZZ I was still a little fast but felt that I was stabilized enough for the approach. Upon reaching ZZZZZ the Autopilot began the procedure turn so I disengaged the autopilot to continue direct to ZZZZZ1 and shortly thereafter the ZZZ Tower asked me to report at ZZZZZ1; which I acknowledged. I began my approach descent and broke out of the clouds at 1800 ft. and could see the airport. About half way to ZZZZZ1 the ZZZ Tower called and said they had a low altitude alarm and asked my altitude. I said I was VFR; had the field in sight and my altitude was 1300 ft.; which surprised me. They advised me to be very careful regarding possible obstacles. During flight planning I had reviewed the NOTAMs and chart to look for any obstacles on the approach and also took another look at my charts to confirm that there were none; so I continued my approach without returning to the required altitude. I also reported ZZZZZ1 when I passed the fix. HUMAN PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS: After landing I gave a lot of thought to the approach. In summary; a number of things happened (i.e. late descent resulting in arrival at ZZZZZ too quickly and too fast; misunderstanding of some communications and relaxing my vigilance once I had broken out of the clouds and was VFR with the field in sight) during the approach; which resulted in me being overloaded. In the overloaded state I focused on the things I thought were most important: maintaining control of the plane; navigating to the airport and making a successful landing. I handled the Autopilot error in turning for a hold because I was hard wired to disengage it and continue direct to ZZZZZ1. I was disappointed by not maintaining the proper altitude to ZZZZZ1. When I broke out of the clouds and saw the airport I felt like I was now VFR; relaxed somewhat and mistakenly let my altitude descend below the 1;700 foot altitude before I reached ZZZZZ1. In retrospect; when the ZZZ Tower called me I should have also cancelled the IFR flight plan.In the last several years I've had ATC keep me at a pretty high altitude; necessitating a quicker; faster descent than I had planned; but this approach was more difficult than other's I have experienced. In the future; I think if this occurs I'll ask ATC for vectors to enable me to make the descent at more reasonable speeds and descent rates and allow more time for more communications with ATC and the Tower; if it is needed.",,,,"Cessna P210 Single Pilot reported a CFIT event during final approach due to overshooting minimum altitude which was followed by an ATC low altitude alert.

My wife was with me and I provided her a phone number for ZZZ approach from my iPad and we informed them of our situation and they provided a vector to ZZZ. Cell signal was broken and barely readable. Signal cutoff very soon into the phone call.

We cleared the area for traffic; pumped the gear down; and landed at ZZZ without incident. Immediately when I landed and cleared the Runway I called ZZZ approach on my phone and informed them of my location and canceled IFR. The lady was glad I made it with no incidence and canceled my flight plan. I did not see any advance warning of this situation happening but I may have noticed a drop in voltage sooner?

At the time of the incident; we were located 4.4 nautical miles southeast of ZZZ over the VFR Checkpoint; short of the Bravo and Mode C Veil Shelf. After monitoring ZZZ's radios; we listened to ZZZ Approach. ZZZ Approach was vectoring us into ZZZ1 when they warned us about incoming traffic bearing at our altitude at 8 o'clock. My CFII took the controls and descended from approximately 2300 ft. to 1787 ft. MSL to avoid a Skyhawk possibly flown by aircraft owner: Person A. My CFII reported that the other aircraft was very close to us and made no attempt to alter its course. After the incident; we were cleared back to our altitude for the approach back into ZZZ1. We landed safely at ZZZ1 minutes later. Despite the close proximity of the other aircraft; they made no radio calls on ZZZ's frequency; made no radio calls on the ZZZ Approach frequency; and made no attempt to avoid our aircraft. We were able to later retrieve information on Aircraft Y. The aircraft has a record of its flight plans that evening; which later showed it arriving at ZZZ2. We discovered their information on the internet. I would like to express my gratitude to ZZZ Approach and my CFII for their efforts and quick action during this near-mid-air collision. If any authority figure would like to reach out; I can provide more information.",,,,"C210 Pilot with Flight Instructor reported NMAC with a C172.",

While enroute to ZZZ1; somewhere approximately 25 miles north of ZZZ4; I observed the NAV/COM 1 receiver to begin displaying a glideslope receiver error. I further observed the glideslope needle on CDI 1 rapidly going from full scale deflection up to full scale deflection down. This persisted for several minutes; despite turning the NAV/COM 1 off and then back on again. The NAV/COM 1 eventually turned off and was unable to be turned back on. Several minutes later I observed that the transponder had turned off and was unable to be turned back on. I checked the aircraft's analog ammeter gauge which appeared to still show a slight charge. With the slow onset of multiple failures of electrical equipment I began to suspect that this gauge was inaccurate. Shortly after losing the transponder the rest of the electrical gauges and equipment; including the second radio; became inoperative and were unable to be turned back on.Knowing now that I had experienced a complete electrical failure I shed the electrical load by turning off any remaining electrical equipment and resetting the generator circuit breaker on the circuit breaker panel. This did not correct the issue. Thinking that either the generator or voltage regulator on the aircraft had failed; I began looking for the nearest suitable airport to land at. It should be noted that I was still flying over rugged mountainous terrain with lower; mostly flat terrain; well ahead on my intended flight path. Weather had also accumulated to my south with what appeared to be visible precipitation. Knowing that the ambient air temperature was conducive to icing conditions; and I would be unable to navigate in IMC; I knew that the number one objective was to remain in VMC. I continued using my EFB app on my iPad to try and find the nearest airport that appeared to be in VMC conditions. My preference would be on airports that were outside of mountainous terrain that allowed for a smooth and predictable VFR approach to landing. A controlled field with emergency services and snow removal equipment was also preferrable as the entire region had been blanketed in snow in the days and weeks prior to my flight.During my search I sent a text message to another rated Commercial Pilot that was monitoring my flight and asked them to look for a suitable landing alternate. I informed them that I had experienced an electrical failure and would need to land. This pilot evaluated the options along my route and notified me that ZZZ appeared to be the best option as they were reporting the most favorable wind; visibility; ceiling; and runway conditions. I proceeded past several other airports on my way to ZZZ that did not favor a VFR approach to landing at the time of my flight and continued on to ZZZ. As I approached ZZZ airspace I used my handheld transceiver to contact ZZZ Approach. ZZZ TRACON had been notified of my situation and were expecting my arrival. They began giving me instructions to enter the Class D airspace and set up for a right base entry to Runway XX. ZZZ Approach then handed me off to ZZZ Tower. I explained to ZZZ Tower that I was not requesting priority handling as my landing gear and all other necessary equipment was still operational. I further explained to them that I was on a handheld radio and that the aircraft radios; lights; and transponder were not operational. ZZZ Tower cleared me to land and I landed without incident. After landing I gave my information to the emergency ground personnel that responded to the scene at their request. The plane was then service by a local avionics shop and it was eventually determined that the aircraft's generator had failed at some point in the flight. Upon reviewing the flight I evaluated other options that I might have had in regards to landing alternates. With the large amount of mountainous terrain in the area; the worsening weather conditions; and the knowledgethat the weather and terrain improved the further I flew east; I feel that ZZZ was indeed the most suitable and safest alternate landing site available to me at the time. While I think I might have made the same decision on my own; I was not set on choosing ZZZ until I had received a message from my fellow pilot on the ground. Along with communicating via cell phone with another pilot during this urgent situation; further contributing to the safe outcome was my possession and use of a handheld transceiver unit. With this handheld radio I was able to communicate with the ZZZ TRACON and land at the most suitable airport I had available to me at the time.",,,,"Cessna 210 Pilot reported a complete electrical failure and a diversion to the nearest suitable airport for landing.",

We departed the airport and remained in closed traffic for a low pass with the landing gear up.Upon completion of the low pass; we remained in closed traffic for landing. Upon selecting the landing gear down; all electric power was lost. Apparently; the primary alternator failed. The standby alternator was incapable of providing sufficient power so automatic load shedding took place. All communication was lost.Once the pilot reduced the load on the standby alternator; some communication capability was restored. However; out of an abundance of caution; the pilot decided to lower the landing gear with the emergency pump. After completing the required number of pump cycles; the landing gear down light illuminated. The Tower was contacted and a normal landing followed.

I issued multiple low altitude alerts and got the pilot to climb to a safe altitude and vacate the approach. I asked the pilot if he was having equipment issues or if there was something wrong with the aircraft. The pilot advised the issue was with the pilot himself. Knowing he was in an unsafe and scary situation; I tried to calm the pilot and reassure him by getting him to focus on maintaining the altitudes I assigned. I asked how much fuel too and he said 2 hours. I offered ZZZ1 as an alternate with better weather. The pilot asked for another approach at ZZZ so I gave him a heading to fly and periodically checked back in to make sure his altitude and heading were good. He asked if the weather was still IMC at ZZZ. I said yes and then he asked to try ZZZ1. I gave vectors and kept prompting the pilot to maintain a safe altitude. I issued more Low Altitude Alerts.

The pre-purchase inspection revealed oil leaks and compression leaking past the rings; however when speaking to one of the previous owners immediately prior to departure 'Oil consumption was negligible' and 'it blows the top quarts off if its full.' No advice was provided about avoiding long distance or high altitude flight. The dipstick indicated 8.25qts cold; and the owner provided me a quart for the trip home in-case I needed it.After an uneventful 3.5h flight to ZZZ. I topped off fuel; added the quart of oil; and the engine indicated 7.25 qts (hot); and I figured this was approximately a quart lower than true due to oil being spread throughout the engine instead of dropped down in the oil pan. Therefore; the oil consumption was between 1 and 2 quarts for the first flight. I took off from ZZZ and noticed a loss of 'normal' ~50PSI oil pressure after about 2 hours into flight while cruising IFR at FL250. The oil pressure was about 30PSI at the bottom of the 'normal' operating range. About 15 minutes later; I begin to notice a 1-2' manifold pressure fluctuation and 5-10PPH fuel flow fluctuation coinciding with the manifold pressure fluctuation. Turning on fuel pumps; switching tanks; and adjusting mixture or throttle did not solve the problem. Quite quickly ~5 minutes after the first noticed fluctuation; nearly total engine power was lost as manifold pressure and fuel flow plummeted.A distress call was made to ATC and I tried a variety of mixture/fuel/throttle settings; but none provided much power at that altitude. Without recovering significant engine power; I [requested ATC assistance]; began a rapid descent and ATC provided excellent services. I turned the prop to low RPM to provide less drag and chose a landing site. While in the descent to ZZZ1; oil pressure was above redline but very low; and engine temperatures plummeted. At lower altitudes; the engine responded with adequate power; but a gliding precautionary normal landing was conducted. During rollout and taxi; the oil pressure was back to the middle of green (~50PSI); so I elected to continue to taxi and shut down thinking that there was no permanent engine damage. After shutdown; I provided reports to airport personnel regarding the [incident].After filling the engine with 9 QTS of oil; maintenance at ZZZ1 cleaned the engine compartment and identified an oil leak around a STC'd Stratus C6LC-L oil filter adapter retaining through-bolt. The oil in the engine compartment and on the bottom of the aircraft was significantly worse than it was in ZZZ; and indicated a significant increase in the oil leak rate on the second flight. The oil adapter bolt was re-tightened and no other significant oil leaks were found. Ground checks were normal as well as the ability to make full power at field elevation. Upon the flight to ZZZ2; the engine became bootstrapped at 75% power at 13;500ft; possibly indicating turbocharger; wastegate; or turbo controller damage. I will continue to investigate as the aircraft maintenance schedule allows.I could've added more oil in ZZZ; and I could've grounded the aircraft in ZZZ for maintenance; however the data at that point didn't indicate such a high oil consumption rate. It's also possible that the cold temperatures at FL250 around the housing (-30F) were enough to shrink it while the through bolt was expanded from ~160F hot oil; thus resulting in an increase in oil leakage at that altitude & temperature. I could have cruised lower; however this would have resulted in a longer trip and more operation time.",,,,"Cessna T210L pilot reported diverting to an alternate airport after experiencing power loss and low oil pressure at FL250.

Aircraft X was cleared as filed up to 190 departing Runway XX at ZZZ. His route took him direct to his destination southeast bound. I was pretty busy with people looking for clearances and multiple arrivals. An aircraft missed their void time departing ZZZ1 and I had some arrivals trying to get in but we had to get that figured out first. So lots of stuff going on. The terrain rises very rapidly southeast of ZZZ. I noticed Aircraft X climbing out of 085 MSL or so and entering our 120 MIA. He was going to be in the 140 very shortly after and then the 160 around ZZZ2. I verified he had good visual on the terrain which he did; but I didn't want him to fly into the higher terrain if he didn't have to so I gave him a vector to the East to keep him in the 120 MIA while he was still at 090. The ZZZZ departure follows this route to the east out of ZZZ. I'm familiar with the geography of the area so between these two things I was comfortable taking the guy on a heading below the terrain. He was cleared as file off the ground so terrain obstruction is on him climbing out but I'd rather turn a guy below our MIA than let him fly into the side of a 14er.",,,,"Center Controller reported vectoring aircraft off the SID causing controlled flight towards terrain.",

After clearing Runway XX while taxiing during two closely spaced consecutive LH turns; I became concerned that I would not be able to complete the turn without risking leaving the edge of the cement taxiway causing me to depart rightward possibly into the nearby taxi lights.  I therefore elected to shut down the engine and directed the aircraft off the taxiway between taxi lights under control.

Touched down at normal speed and at about the 1000' mark on the runway and began slowing down by raising flaps; pulling back slightly on yoke to put more pressure on main tires; and applying pressure on brakes. Noticed at 1500-1000' remaining mark that aircraft was not slowing appropriately and applied harder brake pressure; at that time aircraft began/was veering to the left of the runway; and no pressure on right brake. I called for copilot to apply brakes also; he stated full forward on brakes; but right brake did not have any pressure. Aircraft departed runway between taxi lights and cut corner to taxiway where it came to a stop. Besides tracks through grass aircraft did not hit anything and did not have any damage. Attempted to taxi back to hangar but steering was ineffective without right brake and shut aircraft down on the taxiway to move manually back to hangar. Problem appears to be a failure of the right brake. On startup and initial taxi brakes were sufficient to hold aircraft during runup and to taxi around field. Unsure of cause of failure. Contacted mechanic to inspect and repair right brake and will not fly until the problem is diagnosed and fixed.",,"Upon landing in a Cessna 210; the aircraft was not slowing down as we were reaching the end of the runway. The plane started to veer hard to the left. The pilot flying told me since I am another pilot to hop on the brakes as well. The left brake was working but the right was not; and since we were still at 40 knots and not slowing down quickly the brakes were locking up. As I went to push the brake pedals; my left foot hit the brake quickly and my right foot went almost to the floor. We turned hard left and went off the runway into the grass. No lights or signs were hit; but some tire marks were left in the grass. eventually got it back on to the taxi way and shut down.",,"Two pilots in a Cessna 210 reported loss of directional control after landing that resulted in a runway excursion.",

I began a VFR flight from ZZZ1; planning to climb to 16;500 MSL before crossing the highest terrain on the route.  I created a VFR flight plan to ZZZ2 but was unable to raise ZZZ Radio to activate it enroute.  I wore an oxygen conserving cannula and used the aircraft's built-in oxygen system; both of which I had used previously this year. I turned the oxygen system on before takeoff; having placed the cannula in proper position on my face for use.As I climbed and reached 16;100 feet; I noticed abnormal feeling mostly described as tingling in my fingers. I had been checking the O2 flow rate and even setting it a bit greater than what was required (a flow rate for 18-19;000 ft).  I checked it again and immediately decided to head for lower altitude. My data recorder says I started the descent from 16;800 GPS altitude. I was thinking I may be experiencing carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning or low oxygen saturation; and I began to feel less mentally sharp which was certainly alarming.  So I expedited my descent; using the autopilot to maintain the descent; set a target altitude and direct-to nearest and familiar airport; ZZZ.  I breathed more deeply and fully; concentrating on not hyperventilating; but even as I descended through 10;000; I did not feel better.  I was lightheaded and could tell my decision making was impaired.  My concern was that it might worsen; so I continued to actively avoid task saturation by relying on the autopilot to descend to and maintain traffic pattern altitude and to make lateral navigation. I made radio calls for airport advisory rather than uses ASOS but received no responses. I used ForeFlight on my iPad to see what runway was favored by winds to make that choice. I noticed my speech was slurred on the radio; and of course that concerned me too.  I continued to experience the tingling; a somewhat rapid breathing; but I had not at all identified the problem.  I knew I needed to get on the ground as soon as I could do so safely.  I lowered the gear about 5 miles out to help ensure I did not forget it. I flew a left downwind and make radio calls on downwind and short final.  I used checklists to avoid missing steps because I could tell I was impaired.  Made a nice landing though I think I forgot to deploy flaps. After roll out on RWY XX; I exited at [Taxiway] 1 and did not feel safe to taxi to the ramp. I shut down engine past the hold line at 1 and set the brake. Made a radio call for assistance and got no response.  Tried again stating I had a medical emergency; and immediately got a response from the FBO who responded promptly with the fire engine. I got out of the plane to sit on the left main tire in case there was CO in the cabin. The aircraft CO monitor read 15ppm which I believed was not immediately hazardous; but as I continued to feel quite poor and light headed; I had no plan or desire to taxi back to the terminal. My hands and feet were tingling. I also wanted out and to be close to the ground in case I fainted.  I wrote a note on my paper notepad describing what felt like and the CO reading in case I could not later describe it.I conversed with the two airport employees who arrived first; wanting to give them symptom description while I could. I also asked then to contact my spouse which they did. Emergency medical personnel arrived shortly thereafter; they found my blood oxygen saturation in the low 90s (about 92%) which I believed was not uncommon for me. They found my blood pressure higher than normal (+30/+30) and attributed that to adrenal response to the stress. I requested oxygen but was not provided that; I believe the medical responders wanted to see my oxygen saturation first; and after they did; they felt there was no need for supplemental oxygen. I discussed symptoms with the EMTs and asked would they mind checking my cannula to see if it flowed oxygen. Isaid that I recalled that; prior to flight; when I turned it on; I did not feel the usual cool flow of gas; but I was satisfied as I double-checked the flow meter and found it responsive to adjustments. They also used a CO monitor to 'sniff' the aircraft cabin for presence of that gas; they found nothing remarkable.  But; they did find no oxygen flow from the conserving cannula and brought it to me to show me two cuts nearly completely through the clear plastic line after the flow meter and before the cannula.  Case solved ! The EMT's also conducted a 4 probe EKG and found those readings very normal.  After 10-15 minutes in the ambulance; my oxygen saturation had reached 96-97%.My lessons learned are to inspect my critical equipment to include all oxygen equipment; to pay attention and investigate further when something is not as I expected (the lack of cool oxygen flow into my nose). I also learned that my body does not quickly recover from insufficient oxygen. I am glad I reacted immediately by descending safely but rapidly; and I was glad to have the autopilot and other automation to help me when impaired.  Paying attention and taking quick corrective action was critical; so my additional lesson learned was to confirm the need for quick action. I am lucky to have had low terrain available from my position and a nearby airport.  From when I commenced my descent; it took 11 minutes to get to traffic pattern altitude and 16 minutes to reach the runway surface. Even after landing; I felt too poorly to taxi.  So it's good I landed when I did.",,,,"A C210 pilot reported oxygen system failure resulting in Hypoxia symptoms and diversion to the nearest suitable airport.",
