I PROCEEDED TO MAKE 2 PASSES OVER AND AROUND THE FIELD WHERE I PLANNED TO LAY SOME SMOKE IN ORDER TO VERIFY THE WIND DIRECTION. I SET UP TO DSND OVER THE PWRLINES AND ONCE PAST THEM; I WOULD LEVEL OUT ON THE DECK TO LAY SOME SMOKE; AS I HAVE DONE THOUSANDS OF TIMES BEFORE. IN COMING DOWN; DUE TO THE OVCST; I WAS UNABLE TO SEE THE LINES THEMSELVES; BUT IN JUDGING MY RELATIONSHIP TO THE GND. I CONSIDERED THAT MY FLT PATH WAS PLENTY HIGH ENOUGH TO CLR THE WIRES. I WAS EVEN A LITTLE HIGHER THAN NORMAL. I SAW THE LINES ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT I HIT THEM. I APPARENTLY CUT THEM WITH A COMBINATION OF MY PROP AND WIRE CUTTER THAT IS ON MY WINDSHIELD SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS PURPOSE. I KNEW RIGHT AWAY WHAT HAD HAPPENED. I IMMEDIATELY PULLED UP TO GAIN SOME ALT AND PROCEEDED TO LOOK OVER THE ACFT FOR ANY DAMAGE. EVERY THING SEEMED ALL RIGHT (THROUGH SIGHT AND SOUND). I THEN VERIFIED THE DOWNED PWRLINES AND PROCEEDED TO COMPLETE THE APPLICATION. ONCE I DETERMINED THAT IT WAS SAFE TO DO SO. UPON LNDG; I CLOSELY CHKED OVER THE ACFT AND ONLY FOUND A FEW SCRATCHES FROM THE LINES. I THEN RPTED IT TO THE PWR COMPANY. I BELIEVE THE CAUSE WAS A COMBINATION OF ME NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE THE LINES DUE TO THE OVCST AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT THE LINES WERE A LOT HIGHER THAN NORMAL BECAUSE THEY WERE STRETCHED ACROSS A DRAINAGE AREA OR 'DRAW.'",,,,"AG ACFT STRUCK PWRLINES DURING CROP SPRAYING OPS.",

ANOTHER BRIEFING (ABBREVIATED) WAS OBTAINED (WITH NO SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN THE DEST WX) AND A CLRNC ON REQUEST WAS MADE AT AB29 AM; AN HR LATER WE WERE GIVEN A TKOF CLRNC AND PROCEEDED WITH AN UNEVENTFUL BUT WETTER AND ROUGHER THAN EXPECTED FLT. SYR APCH GAVE THE TERMINAL WX BEFORE ATIS WAS IN RANGE; VISIBILITY WAS EXCELLENT AND WINDS WERE GIVEN AS 020 AT 10; RWY 10 IN USE. WHEN NEARER THE ARPT WE LISTENED TO ATIS AND CONFIRMED THIS INFO. ALTHOUGH THIS DIRECTION WAS 80 DEG ACROSS THE RWY; A WIND OF 10 KTS AND NO GUSTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN NO PROB IN MY OWN AIRPLANE (I'VE BEEN FLYING THIS C-180 FOR OVER 10 YRS) IN ANY CASE IT WAS OFF 60 DEG FROM THE OTHER RWY OF CHOICE (RWY 34) AND I PROCEEDED TO USE THE 'IN USE RWY.' I DID NOTE TO MY PAX THAT I WAS SURPRISED BY THE AMOUNT OF R RUDDER I NEEDED TO LINE UP WITH THE RWY; BUT I DID NOT RUN OUT OF RUDDER AND DECIDED TO KEEP UP ON MY XWIND LNDG SKILLS. THE WIND CLOSE TO THE RWY DID NOT DIMINISH AS IT OFTEN DOES AND A SMALL BOUNCE ON TOUCHDOWN CAUSED BY SHIFTING WIND SPD RESULTED IN THE UPWIND WING GETTING CAUGHT BY THE WIND AND THE AIRPLANE REQUIRED FULL LOCK ON THE AILERONS TO AVOID ROLLING OVER. THIS MANEUVERING LED TO FURTHER DETERIORATION OF CTL AND PERHAPS SOME PANIC BRAKING WITH THE RESULT THAT THE PLANE NOSED OVER. THE APPARENT DAMAGE INCLUDES THE PROP (BENT BACK; NOT FORWARD); SPINNER AND UPPER COWL. INITIAL INSPECTION SHOWED NO ENG MOUNT; FIREWALL; LNDG GEAR; OR OTHER AIRFRAME DAMAGE. THERE WAS NO REAL 'IMPACT' AND NEITHER THE PAX OR THE PLT WAS SCRATCHED OR BRUISED IN ANY WAY. THE PLANE CAME TO REST; TAIL IN THE SKY; ON THE CTRLINE; AIMED PERHAPS 10 DEG TO THE L OF STRAIGHT DOWN THE RWY. WHILE WAITING TO GET THE PLANE REMOVED FROM THE RWY I OBSERVED THAT NOW (10 MIN AFTER THE OCCURRENCE) THE WIND SOCK WAS STRAIGHT OUT AND THE WIND WAS WHAT I WOULD GUESS AT LEAST 20 KTS. I LISTENED TO ATIS AGAIN; AND ALTHOUGH REVISED TO REFLECT THE NOW CLOSED RWY 10 THEY WERE STILL CALLING OUT WINDS OF 020 AT 10 KTS. WHILE FILING MY INCIDENT RPT THE FSDO QUESTIONED MY CHOICE OF RWY 10 AND I WAS TOLD THAT AN ASOS WX OBSERVATION (INITIALS MAY BE WRONG) IMMEDIATELY AFTER MY LNDG SHOWED WINDS OF 350 AT RWY 13. THIS COMMENT BY THE FSDO QUESTIONING MY RWY SELECTION ; AND USING AFTER THE FACT WIND DATA DIFFERING FROM BOTH FORECAST AND ATIS INFO (ATIS BEFORE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER ) STRIKE ME AS VERY MUCH AN EFFORT TO COVER THE FAA'S BUTT AND BLAME THE PLT. THREE WAS NO INDICATION BEFORE LNDG THAT A CURRENT PLT; IN A FAMILIAR ACFT; WITH A LIGHT XWIND WOULD HAVE ANY PROB LNDG. THE ATIS WX WAS WRONG; BUT THE MOST DETAILED INFO AVAILABLE. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT MOST PRUDENT PLTS GIVEN THE SAME INPUTS WOULD HAVE MADE A DIFFERENT SELECTION. I BELIEVE THAT WINDS SUBSTANTIALLY STRONGER THAN RPTED WERE A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION.

AFTER XING THE RWY AND NEARING THE PUMPS A SMALL VERI-ESE KIT PLANE TAXIED UP ON MY L AND I THOUGHT HE ALSO WAS GOING TO THE PUMPS SO I WAVED HIM ON SINCE I WAS IN NO HURRY. HE DID NOT MOVE SO I CONTINUED TO THE PUMPS. THE PLT OF THE VERI-ESE ACCOSTED ME AND ACCUSED ME OF HAVING CROSSED THE RWY AS HE STARTED HS TKOF. I TOLD HIM THAT IF I HAD DONE SUCH A THING I WAS TERRIBLY SORRY AND APOLOGIZED. I PERSONALLY THINK HE WAS MORE INTERESTED IN IMPRESSING HIS LADY PAX REGARDING THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ACCIDENT THAN ANYTHING ELSE. MOST ACFT BEGIN THEIR TKOF ABOUT 100 FT TO THE L OF WHERE I CROSSED. BEYOND THIS POINT; TO THE L; THE RWY SLOPES DOWN ANOTHER 300 OR 400 FT TO THE END WHERE I PRESUME HE MUST HAVE BEEN. THE VERI-ESE KIT ACFT IS SMALL; STANDS ONLY ABOUT 18 INCHES HIGH IN THE FRONT AND HAS A VERY THIN PROFILE LOOKING FROM THE FRONT. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT SUCH AN ACFT SHOULD OPERATE A STROBE LIGHT FOR BETTER VISIBILITY. FINALLY; I REGRET THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED IF AS ALLEGED.

APCH CLRED ME; ASSIGNED A XPONDER CODE AND GAVE ME RADAR VECTORS TO THE ACTIVE ILS APCH. I WAS NOT IFR CURRENT AND ACCEPTED AN APCH FOR WHICH THE ACFT WAS NOT EQUIPPED AS I HAD NO LOC GS RECEIVER. RATHER THAN TELL ATC THAT I HAD NO LOC; I ACCEPTED THE ILS APCH WHILE INTENDING TO FLY THE NDB APCH TO THE SAME RWY 19R AT FAIRBANKS. THE ACFT WAS EQUIPPED FOR THE NDB RWY 19R APCH AND THAT IS THE APCH I ACTUALLY FLEW; BUT I DID NOT TELL ATC THAT AND; INSTEAD; ACCEPTED THE RWY 19R ILS. WHILE BEING VECTORED TO THE INITIAL APCH FIX FOR THE NDB APCH; THEN; ON XING IT AND FLYING THE APCH; PART OF MY ATTN WAS DISTR BY THINKING ABOUT HOW I WAS GOING TO FLY THE NDB APCH SO ACCURATELY THAT IT WOULD NOT INDICATE TO ATC THAT I DID NOT OR MAY NOT BE ILS EQUIPPED. THIS DISTR ME FROM FLYING THE AIRPLANE ENOUGH THAT; THROUGH THE WHOLE DSCNT AND APCH; I DID NOT PULL CARB HEAT; AND; AS A RESULT; THE ENG QUIT ON ABOUT A 2 MI FINAL. FORTUNATELY I WAS VISUAL AT THAT TIME AND HAD CANCELED IFR. I AND THE FAA FSDO INSPECTORS ARE; I BELIEVE; IN AGREEMENT THAT THE CAUSE OF THE PWR LOSS WAS CARB ICE AS IT WAS WET IN THE CLOUDS THAT DAY WITH TEMPS IN THE 40-50 DEG RANGE FOR THE 20 MINS OR SO BEFORE THE ENG QUIT AND I DID NOT PULL CARB HEAT DURING THAT TIME. ON CHKING FOR FUEL AT THE GASCOLATOR; TANK SUMP DRAINS AND BY COMPARING THE EXPECTED FUEL BURN (23-24 GALS) WITH THE FUEL ON BOARD FOR THIS FLT (40 GALS); IT COULD NOT HAVE BURNED ALL THE FUEL UNLESS THE ENG BEGAN BURNING MUCH MORE FUEL THAN NORMAL ON THIS FLT. ANOTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN THE HUMAN PERFORMANCE AREA IS THAT I HAVE OWNED THIS AIRPLANE; A CESSNA 180; SINCE ONLY LAST AUGUST; BUT HAVE OWNED AND HAD RECENTLY FLOWN A CESSNA 185 FOR 18 YRS. THEY HANDLE; FEEL AND PERFORM CLOSE TO THE SAME; BUT THE 185 IS FUEL INJECTED; THE 180 CARBURETED. I HAVE OVER 1000 HRS IN THE 185; BUT ONLY ABOUT 40 HRS IN THE 180. I BELIEVE THIS CAUSED ME TO USE 185 FLYING HABITS ON THIS DSCNT AND APCH; NEGLECTING THE CARB HEAT WITHOUT GETTING THE UNEASY FEELING THAT I HAD MISSED SOMETHING. THERE WERE; I BELIEVE; 2 OTHER HUMAN PERFORMANCE FACTORS. ONE; I WAS USING A CHKLIST TAKEN FROM A COMBINED 180-185 CHKLIST PREPARED BY A PLT WHO FLIES BOTH. I NOW SEE THIS WAS A MISTAKE BECAUSE THE CARB HEAT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE 180 PRE-APCH CHKLIST BUT; OF COURSE; IS MISSING ENTIRELY FROM THE 185 CHKLIST. THE 2ND IS THAT; SINCE I WAS NOT IFR CURRENT AND WAS FLYING THE NDB APCH INSTEAD OF THE ILS; I WAS TOO BUSY TO USE THE PRE-APCH OR LNDG CHKLIST AND CHKING OFF ALL ITEMS BY MEMORY; BROUGHT UP MY 185 EXPERIENCE (WITHOUT CARB HEAT). CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: I WILL REVISE THE APCH/LNDG CHKLIST TO INCLUDE CARB HEAT. I WILL PUT A YELLOW (CAUTIONARY) ARC ON MY MANIFOLD PRESSURE GAUGE FROM 18 INCHES TO 12 INCHES AND TEACH MYSELF THAT I MEANS CARB HEAT IS TO BE ON WHEN OPERATING AT SUCH LOW PWR SETTINGS. I WILL (1) GET A LOC/GS FOR THIS AIRPLANE SO THE AIRPLANE IS EQUIPPED TO FLY THE APCHS MOST COMMONLY OFFERED AT THIS; MY HOME ARPT. I WILL GET SOME IFR DUAL; THEN AN IFR CHK-RIDE IN THIS AIRPLANE; PAYING PARTICULAR ATTN TO USING A PRE-APCH CHKLIST AND PULLING CARB HEAT WHEN IN IMC OR AT REDUCED PWR AND PAIRING UP THE PITOT HEAT (WHICH I HAD PULLED ON ENTERING IMC) WITH THE CARB HEAT; AS MUCH OF THE TIME; IF ONE IS ON; SO SHOULD BE THE OTHER. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: AS THE ACFT WAS DSNDING WITHOUT PWR; THE PLT NOTIFIED THE TWR OF CONDITION; AND LANDED ON A HWY. FUEL WAS ADDED; AND WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE SHERIFF (BLOCKING THE HWY); THE PLT FLEW THE AIRPLANE TO FAIRBANKS AND ATTENDED CHURCH. THE FAA INVESTIGATION REQUIRED A MECH TO CHK THE FUEL FLOW RATE (1.5 TIMES THE FUEL DEMAND OF THE ENG); AND THE VENTING SYS. FUEL EXHAUSTION WAS NOT CITED AS THE CAUSE OF ENG FAILURE; NOR WAS CARB ICE. INVESTIGATION WAS CLOSED. RPTR STATES CONFIDENTIALLY; THAT IT STILL MIGHT BE POSSIBLE THAT FUEL EXHAUSTION WAS THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE -- THERE ARE VARYING RPTS FROM MECHS ON ACTUAL UNUSABLE AMOUNTS. PLT DOESN'T KNOW WHAT PUSHED HIM SO FAR; BUT FEELS THAT HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD RISK TAKING IS ALTERED.

I TURNED R AND MADE A XWIND LNDG TO THE NE. FORTUNATELY; THERE WAS NO CONFLICTING TFC OR INCIDENT BUT THERE COULD HAVE BEEN. IN REVIEWING THIS EVENT I SEE THAT A PLATE 10-9 PANC; N IS TO THE L AND E IS UP! I THINK THAT WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT WITH TIME TO LOOK AT THE PLATE AND ORIENT IT PROPERLY WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT; BUT AT A GLANCE I RELIED ON N AS TOP OF THE PAGE. I PLACED MYSELF OVER THE APCH END OF RWY 14 INSTEAD OF RWY 6L WHERE I REALLY WAS; THUS MAKING THE R TURN TO THE WATER PUT ME 90 DEGS OUT OF PLACE. I COULD TELL QUITE LATE SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT. I SHOULD HAVE DECLARED AND GONE AROUND. I DO HAVE THE JUDGEMENT TO DO THAT BUT THE FEELING OF DISORIENTATION SEEMED TO OVERPWR CORRECTIVE ACTION AND THE SAFEST IMMEDIATE OUT SEEMED TO BE TO LAND. I MUST SAY THE SIT DEVELOPED VERY RAPIDLY AND THE DIRECTIONAL DISORIENTATION SEEMED TO LINGER AS WITH VERTIGO. 3-DIMENSIONAL AWARENESS HAS BEEN A STRENGTH FOR ME AND NOT A WEAKNESS.

THEY DO NOT HAVE AN ARROW POINT UP WITH THE LETTER 'N' ABOVE THE ARROW TYPE INDICATOR OR COMPASS ROSE. I DISCUSSED THE ORIENTATION WITH ONE OF THE CHART PEOPLE AND INDEED MOST OF THE TERMINAL CHARTS ARE ORIENTED N. FURTHER CONTRIBUTING TO MY EXPERIENCED DIRECTIONAL ILLUSION IS THE CONFIGN OF THE ANCHORAGE LAND MASS. EITHER WAY YOU TURN THE CHART THE SHORELINE AND WATER AT A GLANCE ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE. SO AS I GLANCED AT THE PLATE IN ITS BOOK; THERE WAS A COMPELLING CERTAINTY THAT I WAS OVER RWY 14. I'M NOT ALL THAT FAMILIAR WITH ANCHORAGE. I'VE ONLY BEEN UP HERE FOR A YR. I HAVE STUDIED THE TERMINAL AREA PLT BRIEFLY. I'VE HAD SOME INSTRUCTION OUT OF LAKE HOOD. I SHOULD NOT HAVE MADE THIS MIST. CLRLY THE ERROR AND RESPONSIBILITY IS MINE. I PROBABLY SHOULD NOT BE USING IFR PLATES INSTEAD OF A TERMINAL VFR CHART. TRIP TO ANCHORAGE WAS UNPLANNED WITH AN ELEMENT OF STRESS. I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED MUCH.

CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR STATES THAT THE PARKED PLANE WAS IN A PROPER TIE-DOWN AREA BEHIND THE RED LINE ON THE EDGE OF THE TXWY. THE MAIN PROB IS THAT THERE IS A HUMP ON THE TXWY WHERE THE FORMER ROAD WAS CROWNED AND WHERE IT INTERSECTS WITH THE TXWY. THERE ARE TXWY LINES PAINTED UP TO THAT POINT BUT THEN THE LINES STOP. FOR A TAIL DRAGGER ACFT THESE LINES ARE VERY IMPORTANT SINCE THE PLT CANNOT SEE OVER THE NOSE OF THE ACFT. THEY ZIG- ZAG AND MONITOR THE LINES TO DETERMINE CTRLINE POS.

THIS OP IS GOING TO KILL SOMEBODY IF IT IS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE. (THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE OCT 1996.) THE TFC COMPLEXITY CAUSES THE CTLR TO MISS OTHER ITEMS; LIKE OVERTAKES WHICH HAPPENED DURING THIS TIME REQUIRING A RADAR VECTOR TO ACR Z TO REGAIN SPACING REQUIRED ON THE ARR. I CANNOT BELIEVE THE FARS ALLOW THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY TO EXIST. IT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. FAR 91.303 PROHIBITS AEROBATICS ALONG FEDERAL AIRWAYS. YET NO REG EXISTS TO PROHIBIT SKYDIVERS AND THEIR JUMP PLANES FROM OPERATING ALONG TERMINAL RTES. BOTH SIDS AND STARS GENERATE A LARGER VOLUME OF TFC THAN MOST LOW ALT AIRWAYS. WHEN ARE THESE ACFT (TERMINAL ARRS AND DEPS) GOING TO RECEIVE SOME KIND OF RESTR AIRSPACE PROTECTION? AFTER SOMEONE GETS KILLED! I HOPE WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR THAT. HOW PROB AROSE: DURING THE MAJOR AIRSPACE CHANGE AROUND DFW LAST OCTOBER NO PLANNING WAS THOUGHT OUT ABOUT THIS POTENTIAL PROB. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: MGMNT SEEMS TO THINK THIS IS NOT MUCH OF A PROB. SKYDIVE COMPANY FEELS ITS BUSINESS WAS THERE FIRST AND THE AIRLINES SHOULD BE MOVED. DFW APCH NOT RECEPTIVE TO AIRLINES BEING ROUTED OFF STAR TO AVOID DIVE AREA. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS: BYP AND BYP2 STAR IS THE MAJOR ARR RTE INTO THE DFW METROPLEX FROM THE NORTHEAST UNITED STATES. IT HANDLES MORE THAN 1/4 OF THE TFC INTO DFW ARPT. DURING MAJOR ARR PERIODS AS A CTLR YOU ARE BUSY AND THE FREQ IS TIED UP PROBABLY 80% OF THE TIME. ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD OF CALLING TA'S BTWN THE SKYDIVE ACFT AND ALL THE ACRS IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.

ENRTE TIME FOR THE APPROX 330 NM LEG WAS COMPUTED TO BE 2 HRS 45 MINS (AT 130 KTS GND SPD) WITH 4 HRS FUEL ON BOARD. DURING A PREFLT INSPECTION BEFORE THE FLT; I VISUALLY INSPECTED EACH OF THE 2 WING FUEL TANKS; FELT AND SAW THE AMOUNT OF FUEL AND SECURED BOTH CAPS. A PAX; WHO IS ALSO A PLT AND FLT INSTRUCTOR; MR A; OBSERVED ME PERFORMING THE PREFLT INSPECTION AND HEARD ME VERBALLY CONFIRM THAT WE HAD FULL FUEL TANKS AND ADEQUATE OIL BEFORE DEP. THE FLT WAS UNEVENTFUL EXCEPT THAT I THINK I NOTICED A FAINT SMELL OF GASOLINE AFTER LEVELING OFF IN CRUISE FLT AT 6000 FT BUT THE ODOR DISAPPEARED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. AFTER THE LEVELOFF; ABOUT 10 MINS INTO THE FLT; I SWITCHED FROM THE 'BOTH' POS ON THE FUEL SELECTOR TO 'L' TANK. I RAN ON THE L TANK FOR 1/2 HR AND SWITCHED TO THE 'R' TANK. AFTER ANOTHER 1/2 HR; I SWITCHED BACK TO 'L.' WE WERE NEARING THE AVP; PA; AREA; RUNNING ON THE L TANK; WHEN MR A OBSERVED THAT THE FUEL GAUGES IN THE WING ROOTS APPEARED 'DIFFERENT' FROM USUAL IN THAT THEY WEREN'T BOUNCING AROUND AS THEY USUALLY DID AND WERE BOTH INDICATING 3/4 FULL. HE SAID THEY APPEARED TO BE WORKING BECAUSE THE QUANTITIES WERE GRADUALLY LOWERING BUT THAT THE INDICATIONS WERE UNUSUALLY EVEN AND STABLE. I BECAME CONCERNED SINCE THIS IS NOT A NORMAL INDICATION. I CALLED AVP APCH AND TOLD THEM WE MAY HAVE A FUEL PROB AND NEEDED TO LAND AT THE NEAREST ARPT. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY; THE ENG ROUGHENED AND APPEARED TO PARTIALLY LOSE PWR. I RICHENED THE MIXTURE; SWITCHED TO 'BOTH' FUEL TANKS; AND APPLIED THE CARB HEAT. THE ENG SMOOTHED OUT AND AVP APCH CLRED US FROM 6000 FT TO 3900 FT. WE WERE BEING VECTORED FOR THE ILS RWY 4 APCH AT AVP; STILL IMC AT 3900 FT BUT BREAKING OUT OF THE CLOUD LAYER; WHEN THE CTLR CLRED US TO 3000 FT. WE WERE ABOUT 12 MI FROM THE ARPT WITH GND CONTACT WHEN THE ENG STARTED TO ROUGHEN; MISS; AND SPORADICALLY LOSE PWR AGAIN. I SAW THE HWY UNDER US AND MADE THE DECISION TO LAND ON IT INSTEAD OF TRYING TO REACH THE ARPT. I TOLD AVP APCH WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO AND EFFECTED THE LNDG WITHOUT INCIDENT. TFC WAS LIGHT AND IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT TO LAND THE AIRPLANE IN A CLR AREA; AWAY FROM AND WITH THE FLOW OF TFC. AS SOON AS WE WERE STOPPED I SHUT DOWN THE ENG AND WE PUSHED THE AIRPLANE OFF THE ROAD AND CLR OF TFC WITH THE HELP OF PASSING MOTORISTS. I HAD BEEN ABLE TO CONTACT AVP APCH ON 121.5 MHZ AND ADVISE THEM THAT WE WERE ON THE GND WITH NO INJURIES OR DAMAGE. AS WE WAITED FOR HELP; I CLBED UP ON THE WING STRUT AND SAW THE L FUEL CAP HANGING BY THE CHAIN. I WAS SURPRISED BECAUSE I REMEMBERED CHKING THE TANKS FOR QUANTITY AND SECURITY ON THE PREFLT. THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO FUEL IN THE L TANK AND 2-3 INCHES IN THE R. FROM THE CALIBRATED FUEL STICK I USED TO DIP IT; IT APPEARED TO CONTAIN ABOUT 5 GALLONS. A PASSING MOTORIST WHO WAS ASSISTING ALLOWED ME TO USE A CELLULAR PHONE AND I CALLED MY MECH IN CINCINNATI. HE IS KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THIS AIRPLANE AND ITS SYS AND; WHEN I DESCRIBED THE SIT; HE EXPLAINED THAT IF THE CAP HAD COME OFF EARLY IN THE FLT WHEN THE TANKS WERE BOTH FULL; SUCTION WOULD OCCUR NOT ONLY IN THE AFFECTED TANK BUT THROUGH THE VENT LINE THAT CONNECTS THE 2 TANKS AT THE TOP. FUEL COULD BE SUCTIONED OUT OF BOTH SIDES. HE AGREED THAT THAT WAS WHAT APPEARED TO HAVE HAPPENED. THE STATE POLICE RESPONDED AND; WHEN I DESCRIBED THE PROB; ALLOWED ME TO FILL THE TANKS WITH 15 GALLONS OF AVIATION FUEL WHICH WAS SECURED FROM THE ARPT. I RAN THE ENG; CHKED ALL THE SYS; AND THEN SHUT IT DOWN FOR AN OUTSIDE CHK WHICH WAS SATISFACTORY. THE POLICE CLOSED THE HWY FOR APPROX 5 MINS AND I TOOK OFF ALONE IN THE AIRPLANE AND FLEW TO AVP WHERE MY PAX MET ME AFTER ARRIVING BY GND TRANSPORTATION. FBO AT AVP FILLED THE TANKS WITH 43.7 GALLONS OF FUEL AND; AFTER ANOTHER TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH THE MECH AND A THOROUGH CHK; WE TOOK OFF FOR WASHINGTON; PA; ABOUT A 2 HR FLT. ON LNDG AT WASHINGTON; WE REFUELED WITH 25.9 GALLONS AND PROCEEDED ON TOCINCINNATI; AGAIN WITH NORMAL FUEL CONSUMPTION. I BELIEVE THE L FUEL CAP CAME OFF INFLT AFTER DEP FROM NASHUA; NH; AND THAT; BECAUSE THE TANKS WERE FULL; THE SUCTION CREATED BY THE MISSING CAP CAUSED FUEL TO SIPHON OUT OF BOTH TANKS THROUGH THE VENT OR XOVER LINE. I AM CERTAIN I REPLACED THE L FUEL CAP ON THE PREFLT INSPECTION AT NASHUA; BUT IT IS POSSIBLE IT WAS NOT SEATED PROPERLY. THE CAP IS A MONARCH TYPE WITH THREADS AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN POSITIONED IN A WAY THAT LOOKED CORRECT BUT WAS NOT SECURE AND CAME OFF INFLT. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR STATES THAT THE FAA HAS REVIEWED THE INCIDENT AND INDICATES THAT NO FOLLOW UP ACTION WILL OCCUR. THEY APPARENTLY FEEL THAT THE PREFLT WAS DONE CORRECTLY BUT THE CAP ONLY APPEARED TO BE TIGHT AND WAS NOT.

I TOLD HER MY RTE WOULD BE N AND W OF MARTINSBURG (MRB) AND FREDERICK (FDK) VORS; AND MY RECOLLECTION AND WRITTEN NOTES CLRLY INDICATE HER ADVICE THAT ROUTING N AND W OF THESE VORS WOULD KEEP ME CLR OF P-40. UNFORTUNATELY; THIS WAS INCORRECT; BUT WAS INFO I HAD IN MIND AS I UNKNOWINGLY AND UNINTENTIONALLY APCHED P-40. BTWN LANCASTER (LNS) AND YORK (THV); PA; AND WELL WITHIN 20 MI OF HARRISBURG INTL; I REQUESTED FLT FOLLOWING WITH HARRISBURG APCH; WHO UNFORTUNATELY DID NOT COMPLY WITH MY REQUEST NOR DID THEY WARN ME OF THE UPCOMING P-40. I RECALL GIVING THEM MY POS; HDG; DEST AND ALT. HARRISBURG APCH ADVISED INSTEAD THAT I 'CONTACT ZDC IN ABOUT 20 MI.' I BELIEVE THAT I DID MAKE THAT CALL BEFORE ENTERING P-40. ZDC DID NOT NOTIFY ME OF ANY AIRSPACE VIOLATION AT ANY TIME AND INSTRUCTED ME TO CONTACT POTOMAC APCH ON FREQ 126.10. ON FIRST HAILING POTOMAC; THE CTLR APPEARED UNAWARE OF ANY HDOF FROM WASHINGTON; ADVISING THAT HE WOULD ASSIGN A SQUAWK CODE. I INFORMED HIM THAT I WAS ALREADY SQUAWKING 'XXXX' ASSIGNED BY WASHINGTON. AFTER A SHORT TIME; THE POTOMAC CTLR ADVISED THAT I WOULD NEED TO CONTACT POTOMAC TRACON ONCE ON THE GND. IN RESPONSE TO MY INQUIRY; POTOMAC RPTED TO ME THAT ZDC OBSERVED MY PASSAGE THROUGH P-40 SQUAWKING '1200' WHICH LATER CHANGED TO 'XXXX;' THE CODE WASHINGTON ASSIGNED TO ME AFTER A CONSIDERABLE DELAY FROM MY FIRST CONTACT WITH THEM. AFTER POTOMAC APCH INFORMED ME OF THE AIRSPACE INCURSION AND GAVE ME A TELEPHONE NUMBER FOR POTOMAC TRACON; I FREELY GAVE THEM MY NAME; ADDRESS; HOME BASE; PLT CERTIFICATE NUMBER AND ALL INFO REQUESTED. SEVERAL IMPORTANT FACTORS OCCURRED IN THE MINS PRIOR TO THE AIRSPACE INCURSION. FIRST; MY REDUCED ALT NECESSITATED OCCASIONAL HDG CHANGES TO ALLOW SAFE VERT SEPARATION FROM HILLS; ANTENNAS; AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT. SECOND; I WAS AT A POINT SHARED BY 3 DIFFERENT SECTIONAL MAPS: NEW YORK; WASHINGTON AND CINCINNATI. I WAS; THEREFORE; JUGGLING MAPS AND LOOKING HARDEST AT 'CINCINNATI' AS I'VE BEEN TAUGHT TO 'KEEP AHEAD OF THE ACFT.' WHILE CINCINNATI OVERLAPS WASHINGTON IT DOES NOT INCLUDE P-40. THIRD; THE SETTING SUN WAS DIRECTLY STRAIGHT AHEAD ON OUR 255 DEG COURSE TO ELKINS! MAP READING VISIBILITY WAS VERY POOR; AND OVERUSE OF MY 2 HARDWIRED MAP LIGHTS OR 3 ON BOARD FLASHLIGHTS WOULD THREATEN TO DIMINISH MY NIGHTTIME VISUAL TASKS WHICH SOON WOULD BE OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE. TYPICALLY; MY LONGER XCOUNTRY FLTS ARE IN ACFT WITH AUTOPLTS; MOVING MAP GPS RECEIVERS; AND UTILIZE A COMPETENT CURRENT COPLT. I REALIZE THAT FATIGUE CAN BEGIN AFTER JUST A FEW HRS OF FLT EVEN IN GOOD CONDITIONS; BUT IS INCREASED WHEN THE COCKPIT WORKLOAD IS INCREASED. FLYING IN UNFAMILIAR AREAS IN MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN INCREASES THE RISK OF ERRORS IN JUDGEMENT. THE LESSONS I'VE LEARNED FROM THIS EXPERIENCE ARE NUMEROUS. I NEED TO PERFORM EVEN MORE THOROUGH FLT PLANNING INCLUDING THE AVOIDANCE OF SPECIAL AIRSPACE; ESPECIALLY WHEN FLT FOLLOWING MAY BE UNAVAILABLE; OR WHEN THERE ARE ALT; COVERAGE; AND/OR TIME CONSTRAINTS. I NEED TO BE HEEDFUL OF THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN IN RELATION TO MY ON COURSE HDG. I WILL EXPECT GREATER FATIGUE WITH LESSER AVIONICS; AND WITHOUT A RELIABLE AUTOPLT OR COMPETENT; LICENSED COPLT. I WILL TRY TO NOT BE SO FAR 'AHEAD OF THE AIRPLANE' AS TO NOT CONSIDER THE IMPORTANCE OF EVERY MI I AM CURRENTLY FLYING. I NOW HAVE SPECIFIC PLANS TO UPGRADE THE AVIONICS OF THIS ACFT WHICH WILL INCREASE SAFETY AND IMPROVE RECOGNITION OF SPECIAL USE AIRSPACE.",,,,"PLT OF C180 ENTERS P-40 WHILE ON XCOUNTRY FLT.",

WHILE EXITING SEARCH GRID WHICH WAS ADJACENT TO ARPT; THE NEAR MISS OCCURRED. I FEEL THE MAJOR CAUSES WERE: 1) THE PIC'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE SCAN; 2) MY FAILURE TO PRIORITIZE TFC SCAN WHILE IN ARPT AREA OVER CONTINUING GND SEARCH (LOOKING DOWN) FOR ACFT MISSING; 3) MY FAILURE TO INSIST ON PIC'S MORE VIGILANT SCAN; 4) EARLIER MONITORING OF CTAF. EARLIER INFLT; I NOTICED PIC SPENDING FAR TOO MUCH TIME LOOKING AT GND FOR DOWNED ACFT; OR HIS TRACK ON 1 OF 3 COLOR MOVING MAP OF GPS; INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON SCANNING OUTSIDE AIRPLANE. HIS DUTY WAS TO FLY SEARCH PATTERN AND LOOK FOR TFC. MINE WAS TO KEEP EYES ON GND LOOKING FOR MISSING AIRPLANE. PIC PUT AIRPLANE ON AUTOPLT AND I OBSERVED HIM LOOKING ON GND FOR FAR TOO LONG VERSUS OUTSIDE FRONT WINDOW. I ASKED HIM WHO WAS LOOKING FOR TFC IF BOTH HE AND I WERE LOOKING AT GND? HE REPLIED THAT HE HAD IT ON AUTOPLT AND WAS TAKING LONG LOOKS OUT FRONT IN BETWEEN LOOKING AT GND. I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED AT THAT POINT THAT I SHOULD DISCONTINUE LOOKING AT GND AND BEGIN SCANNING FOR TFC MYSELF. ON PRIOR FLT; I HAD TO PUSH PIC TO MONITOR CTAF WHILE SEARCHING GRID NEAR ARPT. HIS SITUATIONAL AWARENESS OF TFC SEEMED WEAK AND HE SEEMED VERY OVER-RELIANT ON THE 3 GPS DISPLAYS. AT TIME OF NEAR MISS; I WAS MONITORING SEARCH FREQ AND HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MONITORING CTAF. I DID NOT HEAR ANY POS ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM HIM ON THE SHORT TRIP OUT OF SEARCH GRID (LESS THAN 3 MI) TO TFC PATTERN. HE ALSO DID NOT CHK AWOS. WE ENDED UP IN THE DEP PATH OF RWY 1 AT A LOW ALT. IF I HAD BEEN MORE CONCERNED WITH OUR POS; I WOULD HAVE DISCONTINUED SEARCH AND SCANNED FOR TFC MYSELF; BASED ON THE PIC'S SOMEWHAT CASUAL APCH TO COMS AND SCANNING TECHNIQUES NEAR ARPTS AND FROM THE PRIOR FLT EXPERIENCE WHEN HE WAS LOOKING AT GND INSTEAD OF PRIORITIZING TFC SCAN.

THE ARPT IS UNDER THE WASHINGTON; DC; ADIZ; SO HE DOWNLOADED THE DEP PROC FROM PLT WEB SITE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS INFO; HE CALLED THE LEESBURG FSS AND FILED HIS ADIZ PENETRATION FLT PLAN. HE THEN CALLED POTOMAC APCH AND RECEIVED HIS DISCRETE XPONDER CODE AND DEP FREQ. THE ACFT WAS THEN FUELED AND PREFLTED. PLT HAS OVER 900 HRS IN HIS OWN ACFT; A C170; BUT ALL AIRPLANES HAVE VARIOUS ITEMS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THAT ACFT. THE ACFT THAT PLT WAS RETRIEVING; UNDER PART 91; HAS NARCO RADIOS. THE C170 HE REGULARLY FLIES HAS KING RADIOS. IN ADDITION; THE SWITCH PANEL FOR THE INTERCOM AND HEADSETS; WHICH WERE INSTALLED BY THE PREVIOUS OWNER; WERE NOT WELL MARKED SO THE OWNER BRIEFED THE PLT; AND THE NEW OWNER WHO WAS ACCOMPANYING PLT; TOGETHER. AFTER THE ENG RUN-UP; PLT CONFIRMED THE RADIO FREQS AND DID A RADIO CHK WITH THE FBO ON THE CTAF. UPON DEP; PLT BEGAN TO CLB ON COURSE FOR THE BROOKE VOR; WHICH WAS THE FILED RTE.

PLT CONTINUED TO CALL; WHEN ABLE; BTWN OTHER TFC XMISSIONS UNTIL HE PASSED THROUGH APPROX 1500 FT. THE CTLR AT POTOMAC WHO PROVIDED THE DISCRETE SQUAWK CODE EARLIER HAD ADVISED PLT THAT POTOMAC SHOULD BE ABLE TO TALK TO PLTS DEPARTING ACFT QUICKLY ONCE IN THE AIR OFF 2W5; MAYBE ONLY AT 400-500 FT MSL. WHEN PLT'S ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT POTOMAC WERE NOT ANSWERED; PLT BECAME VERY CONCERNED THAT HE MAY HAVE A RADIO FAILURE SINCE HE COULD NOT ESTABLISH 2-WAY RADIO CONTACT. THE NEWLY-PURCHASED ACFT HAD ONLY 1 COM RADIO; SO SWITCHING RADIOS WAS NOT AN OPTION. RECOGNIZING THAT HE AND HIS COMPANION WERE IN HIGHLY SENSITIVE AIRSPACE; PLT DETERMINED THAT THE MOST PRUDENT THING TO DO WAS TO TURN BACK IMMEDIATELY AND GET THE ACFT ON THE GND. PLT WAS ONLY 5-6 MI OUT AT THIS TIME AND WAS ABLE TO RETURN QUICKLY. UPON ENTRY INTO THE PATTERN; PLT WAS UNABLE TO RAISE ANYONE ON UNICOM; WHICH HE HAD DONE PREVIOUSLY DURING THE RADIO CHK BEFORE DEP.

THE NEW OWNER AND COPLT FOUND THAT ONE OF THE SMALL SWITCHES ON THE INTERCOM PANEL WAS NOT IN THE POS THAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN. THE PROB WAS RECTIFIED; AND THE ACFT WAS AGAIN ABLE TO XMIT TO THE FBO. PLT SHUT DOWN THE ENG ON THE RAMP AND IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO THE OFFICE AND CALLED POTOMAC. THE LINE WAS BUSY FOR A SHORT TIME; BUT WHEN PLT GOT THROUGH TO POTOMAC; PLT EXPLAINED TO THE CTLR WHAT HAD HAPPENED. THE POTOMAC CTLR STATED; 'OK; I'LL LET THEM KNOW.' PLT ALSO TOLD THE CTLR THAT THE PROB HAD BEEN FIXED; AND THAT PLT WOULD LIKE TO DEPART AGAIN. THE CTLR INDICATED THAT DEP WOULD BE FINE; BUT THAT SINCE PLT HAD 'TANKED UP ON THE SYS; BUT DROPPED OUT;' PLT WOULD NEED TO GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE DEP FILING SEQUENCE ONCE AGAIN.

WHEN PLT EXPLAINED WHAT HAD HAPPENED THE FIRST TIME; AS WELL AS PLT'S ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO THE RADIO DIFFICULTY; THE BRIEFER TOLD PLT THAT PLT HAD DONE THE RIGHT THING. WITH THE NEW FLT PLAN FILED; PLT CALLED POTOMAC AGAIN AND RECEIVED THE NEW DISCRETE XPONDER CODE. ON THE SECOND DEP ATTEMPT; PLT WAITED UNTIL HE WAS APPROX 1000 FT MSL BEFORE MAKING HIS FIRST CALL. AGAIN; HE RECEIVED NO RESPONSE. PLT CALLED AGAIN; AND THIS TIME THE CTLR RESPONDED; 'DO I HEAR '1234X CALLING?' PLT WAS ACTUALLY FLYING '1234Y' AND PLT THOUGHT THAT THE CTLR MIGHT BE TRYING TO REACH PLT; BUT THAT PERHAPS CTLR HAD MISUNDERSTOOD PLT'S XMISSION AND IDENT. THE FREQ WAS VERY BUSY; AND PLT DID NOT WANT TO STEP ON SOMEONE ELSE'S XMISSION. PLT WAITED A SHORT TIME AND NO ONE ANSWERED THE CTLR; SO PLT ASSUMED THAT CTLR WAS CALLING FOR PLT'S '34Y.'

WITH THE CONSTANT SPD PROP THE RPM DOESN'T DROP AS IT DOES WITH A FIXED PITCH PROP ON A CARBURETED PWR PLANT. THE LOSS OF AIRSPD AND INABILITY TO MAINTAIN ALT WAS THE RESULT OF THE ICE BUILDUP IN THE CARB RESTRICTING AIRFLOW TO THE ENG.

I SET UP AN 80 MPH GLIDE AND CHKED THE FUEL SELECTOR (BOTH); MIXTURE TO BE RICH (WHICH IT WAS); MAGNETOS ON; THEN SELECTED R FUEL TANK AS IT WAS SHOWING THE MUST FUEL (APPROX 1/2); NO HELP; ROCKED THE WINGS TO SEE IF I COULD GET ANY FUEL OUT OF THAT TANK; NO HELP; THEN SELECTED THE L TANK; ROCKED WINGS AGAIN; NO HELP THEN SELECTED BOTH ON THE FUEL SELECTOR; TRIED DIFFERENT MIXTURE SETTINGS WITH NO HELP AND ATTEMPTED DIFFERENT THROTTLE SETTING TO NO AVAIL. LOWERED FULL FLAPS AND BANKED L TO AVOID SOME TREES IN THE FIELD I HAD SET UP FOR. LANDED S IN A SOYBEAN FIELD. LNDG WAS OK WITH NO BOUNCE BUT THE FIELD WAS TOO SHORT AND THEN WHEN APCHING A SLIGHT RISE IN THE FIELD LEADING UP TO A 2-LANE COUNTY ROAD WE BECAME AIRBORNE OVER IT AND LANDED HARD INTO THE FIELD JUST S OF THE COUNTY ROAD APPROX 60-70 FT INTO THE FIELD. WHEN MY PAX AND I EXITED FROM OUR RESPECTIVE DOORS; WE NOTICED THE R FUEL DOOR AND FILLER CAP OPEN/OFF. THE CAP WAS CHAINED TO THE FILLER NECK SO IT WAS LAYING ON THE WING JUST AFT OF THE FILLER NECK. FUEL STAIN WAS OBVIOUS FROM THE FILLER NECK TO THE TRAILING EDGE OF THE R FLAPS; APPEARING THAT THE FUEL CAP WAS LEFT OFF BY THE LINE BOY IN ZZZ2. FUEL WAS THEN SIPHONED DUE TO THE VENTURI EFFECT OVER THE R WING. HAVING THE FUEL SELECTOR IN THE BOTH POS FURTHER EXASPERATED THE SITUATION AS THEN THE FUEL FROM THE L SIDE WAS FEEDING THE ENG BUT WAS ALSO XFEEDING THROUGH THE SELECTOR ON BOTH OVER INTO THE R TANK AND OUT THE OPENED FILLER NECK DUE TO THE VENTURI EFFECT. I BELIEVE THE FUEL FROM THE L TANK WAS EMPTIED FIRST BECAUSE AS STATED PREVIOUSLY IN THIS STATEMENT; IT WAS FEEDING THE ENG AND BEING SUCTIONED THRU THE FUEL SELECTOR ON BOTH OVER TO THE R SIDE AND OUT THE OPENED R FILLER NECK. FUEL FROM THE R TANK WAS PROBABLY FEEDING THE ENG ALSO BUT WAS RAPIDLY BEING SUCTIONED OUT THE OPENED FILLER NECK. I BELIEVE THE FLOAT TYPE GAUGE TO BE ACCURATE ON THE L TANK DUE TO THE SUCTION ON THE R TANK DRAWING FUEL FROM THE L TANK THEREBY SHOWING AN EMPTY OR NEARLY EMPTY L TANK. I THINK THE GAUGE ON THE R TANK ERRONEOUSLY SHOWED 1/2 TANK DUE TO THE SUCTION IN THAT TANK LIFTING THE FLOAT THEREBY SHOWING FUEL IN A TANK WHEN THE FUEL WAS ACTUALLY NOT THERE.

The Bonanza pilot immediately told the tower what had happened and nothing else was said. I have flown into this airport several times and this was the first time I ever had a problem. The tower always seems to know what they are doing. As a pilot I know how difficult it can some times be to spot traffic and even more so for a controller with no radar at a Class D airport.

I fly this route every week. 50 miles prior to my intended top-of-descent point to remain clear of Class B; I was told by NORCAL Approach (113.0) to descend and maintain VFR at or below 6500 FT. This happens every flight and despite my questions to the controllers; I have not received a practical reason for it. This is apparently SOP for this sector as their only response has been 'That's the way we do things.' This time I told them I would cancel flight following and remain at 8500 FT. The Controller elected to continue flight following at 8500 FT. When I got on the ground I called the Operations Manager; and requested an explanation. He agreed to look into it and called back the next day to report that it was not arbitrary but was necessary to descend all VFR aircraft to ensure that they do not inhibit arrivals to SFO and SJC over BOLDR and GILRO intersections. I disagree. At this point I was 38 miles from BOLDR when the jets inbound to SFO are expect to cross at 10;000 FT and 23 miles from GILRO where jets inbound to SJC are expected to cross at 8000 FT. Aside from the fact that this particular day there was tailwind at 8500 FT and headwinds lower; this arbitrary descent reduces the VFR pilot's glide capability; smooth ride selection; the fuel economy. It also condenses all Northwest bound VFR traffic at 6500 FT and 4500 FT; increasing the odds for a midair collision (the top of MRY Class C airspace is 4300 FT). This places the VFR pilot in a difficult position: In order to fly at optimum safe and efficient altitudes; you cannot get flight following. If you want flight following; you must accept increased congestion and reduced glide. As it turns out; when I made the return flight at 9500 FT today; a different ATC sector (124.52) reported that the floor is his airspace was 8000 FT and he wasn't concerned about SJC or SFO arrivals. A B737 even flew right over me at 16;000 FT.",,,,"VFR arrival to SQL from the South; intending to descent at an optimum point to remain below the SFO Class B; is requested to start an early descent to; at or below 6500; reporter contended the ATC practice decreases safety and minimizes fuel economy.",

After the upgrade the autopilot showed a fault so the avionics shop (Avionics Shop #1) sent it out to Avionics Shop #2 for repair. After a sending the components back and forth a couple of times; without a favorable outcome; it was decided to take the aircraft up to Avionics Shop #2 for repair. It was determined that there was a broken wire; in a harness behind the panel; which Avionics Shop #2 said they had repaired. After a through preflight and autopilot ground check we took off. We had set the autopilot for climb in the heading mode (assigned heading) then over to NAV mode once we were told to go direct. We then noticed the autopilot did not capture the course; the autopilots lights dimmed; so we disconnected the autopilot. Sometime after leveling off we lost the radio and then progressively lost all electrics. We were on top of a broken overcast so we squawked 7600 and proceeded to diagnose the problem. The alternator circuit breaker had popped. We turned off the alternator master; reset the circuit breaker; waited a few minutes; and then turned the master back on. It again popped with in a few seconds. We turned off all non essential electrical to conserve power. We had hand held radio that would not allow us to transmit so we monitored 121.5. We continued and proceeded on the assigned course and altitude. We had a Garmin 696 (this unit has its own power supply) that was cross programmed with the Garmin 430W.

I had Tower clearance to do so; but as always the words 'landing on the water is at your own risk' had been added to the landing clearance. The seaplane landing area is near and below the final approach course for Runway 16; so normal procedure is to stay low to the water on final to land on the water. Winds were light and variable with occasional small gusts and sea state was nearly calm. With a calm sea state; depth perception is difficult; so a flat approach with about 50 FPM decent works well. We were set up that way; and I noticed dark water ahead indicating a small gust of wind. I reduced power just as we came to that wind line so the airplane would not 'float'. That worked fine and we made contact with the water in good order. Upon making the transition from landing duties to water taxiing; I noticed two canoes ahead and to my left that would cross my path. They were a type of high-end race canoe; very low to the water with single occupants and the occupants were paddling them hard as if to cross in front of me. I applied right rudder as we came off the step and turned about 10 degrees to avoid a conflict; and upon realizing that they would not be able to go in front of me in time; they stopped paddling. It appeared the occupants where about 14 years old. We were completely off the step and at slow idle taxi when we came close to them and our plane and their boats stayed a bout 100 FT apart; we waved to each other and they paddled behind the plane as we went to dock. As we taxied in; an adult in a small dinghy powered up to us and screamed that we had come too close to his kids; and that they had the right of way since we were a powered water vessel upon landing. I do not know his vantage point; but I suspect he was at a point on the water that compressed the distances for his vision; making it appear that we were much closer than we were. I did not feel there had been any 'close call' and initially was unsure why he was calling out to us. Had I been able to see the canoe's; a solution would be to have landed farther out in the bay; but with the flat approach for the reasons mentioned and their extremely low profile to the water; I did not pick them out on long final. Additionally the gust of wind right at touchdown took my attention. A higher approach profile would have made them easier to pick out on the water; but has the trade off of less safety from the final approach path for 16; and a depth perception issue on the flare. In the future I will make a point to scan the water further out for low objects that are hard to see.",,,,"C180 float plane pilot reports encountering two canoes in his path after landing at the Wiley Post Seaplane base adjacent to Renton field.

Added measured 10 gallons and re-dipped right tank which now read 26 gallons as expected for 36 gallons total. On start up fuel totalizer initialized and read 26 gallons; consistent with initial tank readings. [I] added 10 gal to read 36 gal total. Departed for several nearby wilderness lakes; [I] made left turns approximately 800 AGL while circling a 2;700 FT elevation; rather tricky lake; and determined it was too challenging to land. Added power to depart the area and the engine coughed; sputtered and died. I immediately turned back toward the lake; pulled carb heat on and adjusted the mixture and throttle; and the engine re-started fitfully. [I] declared an emergency and identified location; etc. with FSS and local helicopter operator flying nearby. Engine continued to surge; sputter; start and stop. [I] switched to the right tank and it caught and continued to run. I immediately began a climb; as I was not happy with the lake I was over; and hoped to gain options to other lakes. Engine monitor showed even cylinder temperatures and low EGT's; good oil pressure and oil temperature. [I] was climbing slowly under poor power; lower MP than normal for the altitude; with engine running rough and surging still. Gained enough altitude to head to a longer; lower elevation lake and did so; eventually hopping from lake to lake until over my 350 FT elevation home lake at 7;200 FT MSL. Began circling down over the lake and lost engine power at 6;900 FT MSL. Engine restarted briefly at 4;000 FT and then died again. [I] performed a dead-stick landing to the lake; uneventful [and] reported safe with FSS and local operators. [I] immediately dipped the fuel tanks and both were completely dry. Flight time had been 1.9 hours (time; not tach); including 25 minutes after the engine first quit. Fuel totalizer showed 18.6 remaining. Normal fuel usage is 10.2-12.8 GPH. For comparison; the previous day's flight under similar operating conditions was 1.4 hours and used 15 gallons; however I generally flight plan for 15 GPH just to be on the safe side. While investigating where the missing fuel was or where the error in math was; I made several important discoveries. Upon filling the tanks to the top; I was only able to pump in 72.4 gal. My 1969 POH says I have 84 gal capacity tanks with 79 usable; however; the bladders were replaced in 1999 and they are placarded at 88 gal capacity usable 84; 42 on the outboard and 37 on the inboard fuel points. I either had a bunch of fuel hiding in the bladders; or a reduced capacity. I did a search and found references to options for 88/84/65/60 gallon options on Cessna fuel bladders. Upon calling several fuel cell repair shops I was told ALL Cessna long range tanks are standardized at 80 gallon capacity; 75 usable and that Cessna POH and placards are wrong - reference Airworthiness Directive (AD) 75-16-1 which requires corrected placards and POH pages. I called the [Local] FAA office and they had no idea and referred me to [another office]; who also was unfamiliar. They found the AD; but could not read the specified placards due to poor reproduction. They noted the AD did not apply to my model. I found a note 'B' which said it applied to ALL models if they had fuel cells replaced after the mid 70's (which I had). They referenced a 1969 C180H POH which said total fuel capacity was 79 gallons and referred me to Cessna. I spoke with them; and they found the original service letter; which addressed the fuel cell replacement requirement for specific models in the 70's as well as to re-placard for older aircraft; but excludes the models from 1962-1972 from that requirement. They could not tell me anything about the fuel cells; subsequent AD nor could they read the required placard; and could only provide me with what their publication presented: 84 gallon capacity and 79 usable. I verified the part numbers for my replaced fuel cells are each 40 gallon capacity; 37.5 usable. So the first thing I found is that my fuel bladders are 8 gallons less than the 88 which its placarded for; and the 84 for which it was certified; and the usable is only certified at 75 gallons; not 84 as placarded. Of that 80 gallons actual capacity; I can say with great certainty that no more than 72.4 is usable. This is nearly an hour difference in cruise; and the issue is relatively unknown; even among Aircraft Certification Offices (ACO); well established Cessna maintenance shops and commercial operators; as well as at the manufacturer. When none of these folks can tell a Cessna 180 owner what the maximum capacity of their long-range fuel tanks is; there is a problem. I couldn't even find reference to it on online skywagon reference sites. Only the fuel cell repair shops seemed to know this. This explained where the missing 11.6 gallons (84 usable) was when I filled the tanks from their dry state; but there are still some 8 gallons missing from total capacity - perhaps bladder snaps; or collapsed corners or shrinkage? Unusable fuel below the sumps? The second thing I found out is the dip stick was calibrated for the outboard fuel port; not the inboard; as I had been told. This is the cause of the fuel starvation as the inboard readings indicate 5 gallons more per side; so I had always calculated my fuel with a 10 gallon error. Thus; I departed with 26 gallons; not the 36 I had verified from the dipstick; and its not totally unreasonable to assume I burned it all up in 1.9 hours. However; the fuel totalizer still didn't jive. While the total amount indicated (36 at departure and thus 18.6 upon landing) was based on my inputs directly derived from faulty fuel stick readings; the actual fuel flow has been very accurate over hundreds of hours; so after deducting the 10 gallon error; that meant I should still have had something close to 8 gallons remaining.This mystery was perhaps solved the next morning when I discovered fuel leaking from the left wing. It had not been evident until it dried; but was leaking visibly and streaked along the fuselage to the horizontal stab. I have since had the leak repaired; noted the AD which applies; and fuel capacity in the logbook and will order new placards for the fuel ports and have re-calibrated the fuel stick to the inboard filler ports. I knew there was a fuel flow issue; but did not consider I had under-fueled the airplane; as I had three methods of cross-check in place (fuel meter on the pump; dip-stick; totalizer) so I was biased against thinking I was actually out of fuel. I exclude the 4th method - my Cessna fuel gauges - because they are notoriously inaccurate in flight. Because the engine ran on the right tank; but not on 'both'; albeit not very well; I suspected fuel contamination; a blocked vent; or water sloshing from bladder folds. Had I realized actual fuel depletion I would have still attempted to climb in order to get to a different lake; but would have landed at the third lake I hopped to; as it was comfortably long. I would not have considered continuing on to any other lakes. With the problem undetermined; but the ability to climb and the continued operation over a 20 minute period of time; I made different decisions to continue to attempt to improve my options. I also discovered that with variations in glide speed I did not have much effect on my gliding distance or rate of sink. The Pilot Operating Handbook (POH) specifies 85 MPH as V-glide; and the float plane supplement only contains a statement that the supplement only identifies items which are different from the POH and if it is not included in the supplement; one may rely on the data in the POH. Therefore V-glide remains at 85 MPH; but I'm surprised that the same speed is used with floats; and with variations in float models. In any case; I was sinking like a rock; and will need to gopractice to establish a better glide speed. This may have helped my situation. The biggest outcome from the event is the realization that this compounded situation of dip-stick reading errors of 10 gallons; and a usable fuel of 72 instead of 84 gallons for a total fuel calculation error of over 20 gallons; was an accident waiting to happen. I have ended my flights many times with close to 20 gallons; thinking that was a very conservative margin; and now realize I may have been very close to fuel starvation on multiple occasions and would surely have attempted to continue flight with less at some point; resulting in a potential disaster. Fortunately; this situation had a safe outcome; and caused me to catch the underlying critical issues before an accident happened.",,,,"A 1969 C180 float plane lost power because of fuel starvation but made a safe dead stick lake landing with an estimated 20 gallons remaining.

We started a slow descent at about Kokomo to be under the floor of the Cincinnati Class B airspace when we arrived in the Cincinnati area.I turned the King radio on to get the Lunken ATIS; turned it off; planning to turn it on again near Lunken. We proceeded under the Cincinnati Class B airspace toward Lunken Airport and; when I tried to turn the radio back on; found it had failed. We neared Lunken and I called the Tower on the telephone (cell phone) and advised them of our problem. The Controller cleared us to land on Runway 21L and we did so without incident. I called the Tower when we reached the hangar.When I got home; there was a phone message from Chicago Center and the Controller said he wasn't sure if I was the pilot of [the offending aircraft]; but they wanted to make sure we'd gotten on the ground safely. I called back and talked to a Supervisor who said there was 'no problem'. He said they had mistakenly shown us as being IFR; but he knew we had cancelled. We never were IFR...we were outside the [Class B airspace] (over it) at 11;500; and had asked for VFR traffic advisories.",,,,"Cessna pilot experiences a generator failure at 11;500 FT over ORD Class B.

A turn was made towards lower terrain while slowing to best glide speed. The area is mountainous with thick timber with mixed clear cuts none suitable for landing. About 5 miles west a pasture 1;000 FT diagonally was picked and a forced landing was made with no aircraft damage or personal injury.After my nerves settled down the cause was investigated and found to be fuel exhaustion. I thought I had preflighted the aircraft carefully. I checked both right and left fuel gages and believed them to be reading full. The gages are original equipment for a 1953 Cessna 180 and working properly. The problem is the gages are built with empty and full both on the bottom of the gage very close together. I also think the needle can go below empty in certain attitudes which would put it closer to the full mark and when full can go above full mark which would put them closer to empty mark.My last flight was almost 3 months prior and was a long one; landing not to much above FAA min[imum fuel remaining]. The fuel gages bounce around starting at about 1/4 and go to '0' when parked in the normal ground attitude. With the time since my last flight; I thought my last flight had been from my local fuel stop after filling up; which is the normal way I park the airplane; by the time I get to the hanger the needles read full having only used 3-4 gallons.I was airborne around 30 minutes; which would fit with the fuel to be expected after the real last flight since this flight was at high power settings.What I learned was to do a better preflight and watch out for the fuel gage problem. I did not check the tanks visually which I will try to do anytime the fuel gages are not in the middle. The Cessna 180 tanks are hard to check (high wings made worse by large tires and the lack of any steps to climb up on in case a ladder is not available). The good news is my flight instructor on my last 2 biannual reviews gave me engine failures; my first since Air Force training forty years ago. These helped a great deal. I arrived over the only good field with extra altitude and had to circle the field to lose it. The landing was made diagonally across the field over 50 FT trees. I maintained 80 MPH till short final to make sure I could make the field preferring to crash on the field instead of the trees or the clearings with stumps and rough ground. The landing roll was rough and the touchdown firm but I got it stopped with about 50 FT to spare. The end of the field was coming up fast and I was getting ready to ground loop to avoid hitting fence; trees and stumps.Since the aircraft was undamaged I flew it out the next day. All the performance data I had was checked many times and the 1953 data said I could make it. The aircraft has mods including Horton STOL; Wings X wing extensions and a Texas Skyways 520 engine. The Horton STOL information was the only one that had any useful information the others just said performance was as good as the original aircraft. With the information I had I knew I would better the performance of the original data but not by how munch. I took a mountain flying course where they measured takeoff performance; the only data I had then was the original from 1953. I beat that data at max gross for the data 200 LBS heavier (400 LBS gross weight increase from Wings X). I taxied the takeoff route; made a trial run of 300 to 400 FT at full power and then made the takeoff. The takeoff was way better than I expected with the first part at best angle; I guess because I hit a bump and was put in the air at a high pitch attitude and I felt an unusual airspeed acceleration and just flew by the way it felt since the airspeed indicator was below the stop. I sometimes practice slow flight and the airspeed indicator will read '0' and I am able to maintain level flight and turn with 15-20 degrees of bank. I passed the trees at the end of the field at an estimated 300-400 FT and had accelerated past 70 MPH and was climbing like hell. I could not believe the amount performance was better then expected and cannot explain it.My wish list is for better aftermarket fuel gages; better performance data for aircraft mods and a better brain/training/procedures for me.",,,,"A C-180 pilot eschewed a visual fuel quantity check prior to takeoff; relying; instead; on the fuel gages to assure sufficient quantity for the planned flight. His conclusion that the gage needles were indicating past the F toward E because the tanks were really full proved incorrect some thirty minutes after takeoff. An emergency landing and subsequent departure from a cleared field in the tree covered; mountainous locale were safely conducted; presumably after the tanks were replenished.",

Aircraft violently swerved right and rocked up on left landing gear. The aircraft continued to slide sideways for 2-3 seconds apparently sliding on wear strip on ski until control was regained.

No warning was issued by ATC to the Cessna about wake turbulence. If this hazard was recognized; there were many ways to mitigate it. The Cessna could have been allowed to land first; the Cessna could have landed on another runway (runway 34 was available); the Cessna could have circled until the helicopter landed and spooled down; etc. In the interest of safety; it is highly recommended that ATC warn and or avoid situations were helicopter wake turbulence can lead to a loss of control of a fixed wing aircraft.",,,,"C180 pilot reported loss of directional control on landing rollout when he encountered wake turbulence and rotor blast from a helicopter landing nearby.",

At about 10.5 miles off the 100 radial of the SAX VOR; [a] B777 was visually identified by the pilot flying as posing an immediate threat to the safety of flight. Evasive maneuvering including a maximum performance climb was initiated by pilot flying. Pilot not flying then observed the B777 cross directly underneath the C180 at a total distance allowing the pilot not flying to identify individual people within the B777 aircraft. ADSB IN was in use on the C180; using the Garmin Pilot app on an iPad. The B777 was not observed electronically prior to evasive maneuvering. After the C180 leveled out at about 6000 ft the pilot not flying was able to capture a screenshot of the B777 showing an altitude separation of -500 ft. It is estimated this took place 20-30 seconds after the incident. The pilot flying and pilot not flying were able to confirm using two separate and distinct GPS navigation systems that the C180 was in fact in Class E airspace several miles outside NY B outer ring. Position was also confirmed visually using ground based landmarks. Both the pilot flying and the pilot not flying were able to observe Mode C operation of the C180 transponder; and had previously received radar service on this flight; so are confident Mode C was operable at the time leading up to the incident.Probable cause was ATC refusal to take VFR handoff to provide radar services to VFR aircraft. Contributing factors was ATC inability to maintain separation of an IFR aircraft from additional traffic. [B777] crew's inability to determine separation from VFR traffic using on board traffic detection equipment. C180 crew's inability to see and avoid traffic approaching the NY Bravo airspace until evasive maneuvering was required; due to navigation requirements to avoid airspace and weather in the area at the time of the incident. Possible solutions for consideration would be to ensure air carrier aircraft maintain altitudes more typically associated with air carrier operations while still outside the Bravo airspace. 30 miles from EWR does not require a B777 to fly at 5500 ft when this altitude and area is typically congested with VFR traffic. ATC's refusal to provide radar service to aircraft operating in and around this area should be reviewed. It is common for NY Approach to refuse handoff and not to answer VFR aircraft looking for assistance when operating in these congested areas. Proper approach frequencies specific to airspace and altitude allowing for pilots to monitor approach while circumnavigating an area where multiple frequency changes are common for multiple sections would allow pilots to at least easily listen to the correct frequency while transitioning this airspace to obtain additional awareness of other aircraft.",,,,"C180 instructor pilot reported an NMAC with a B777 near SAX VOR.",

This action was necessitated and justified under FAR 91.3; as explained below. My flight originated from a private water operations site close to the Class D airspace at RNT. Prior to takeoff; I checked all relevant NOTAMS and received the ATIS for RNT. I also received takeoff clearance and permission to operate within the RNT Class D so as to transit north and west to be clear of the SEA Class B and BFI Class D airspaces. After clearing the RNT area; I was close to the University of Washington and headed southwest; under the SEA Class B. I was monitoring the CTAF of 122.9 in the vicinity of 0W0 on Lake Union. As I got closer to 0W0; I was aware of the possible presence of active commercial seaplane activity on Lake Union. Therefore; using the 0W0 CTAF; I announced my call sign; position; altitude; and stated my intent to transition slightly north of 0W0; from east to west; through the ship canal. This is a common transition route used by local pilots and it is familiar to seaplane pilots who fly in this area. After I made the radio call on the 0W0 CTAF; I determined that there were three other floatplanes also operating within the vicinity of Lake Union Waterport. One floatplane was on a southerly heading approaching to land on the north end of the lake from Eastlake; position reported northeast of me. The second floatplane was transitioning west to east through the ship canal; position reported east of me. The third floatplane was on a northerly takeoff roll on Lake Union; position reported south-east of me.At this point; I re-announced my position stating I was heading westbound to Lake Union; and was approaching the I-5 Bridge; which is raised 300 feet over the ship canal. Then as I approached I-5; I continued scanning the skies; but I was unable to make a visual contact with any of the other 3 float planes.While crossing I-5; I obtained visual contact with the second floatplane which was still on climb out after taking off from 0W0. It was heading north and climbing over Gasworks Park. Suddenly; that aircraft turned toward my position and continued to climb in altitude. I know that this plane had to climb to clear the I-5 bridge and it was heading right toward me. I again announced my position over the CTAF; stating I was westbound over I-5; the climbing seaplane announced its intentions to turn east towards University; which placed him in a collision course with me. He did not say that he had me in sight. At that point; as pilot in command; I determined the safest course of action would be to turn out of the path of the climbing plane. I made a second visual scan but I could not get visual contact on the first seaplane (which had been westbound towards me through the ship canal) or the third seaplane (which was last reported as southbound coming from Green Lake). By making this slight southbound turn; later realized that I may have inadvertently and briefly entered the radius of the stadium TFR; which I believe was active for a Game. My altitude at the time was 1;000 and I was approximately 1.5 NM away from the stadium. I believe that this brief and minor transit into an area where a TFR was operationally necessary for the safe operation of my flight under FAR 91.3. As I took these actions; I was maintaining separation from the one aircraft I had in sight while also accounting for the last know positions and headings of the other two aircraft which were not in sight. By making these maneuvers to avoid the oncoming traffic; I was able to complete my flight and the return flight to my home station without any incident. I was not contacted by ATC regarding a possible TFR violation at any point during my flight operations. I have not been contacted since that date by the FAA. The area surrounding 0W0is notoriously congested and often aircraft transit through the ship canal like a bottleneck between the SEA Class B and the RNT and BFI Class D airspaces. Furthermore; when the Stadium TFRs are hot; they prohibit uncontrolled flight over the majority of Lake Union; thus forcing seaplanes to perform take-offs; landings; and transitions; in a small; congested area at the very north end of the lake.I believe the best way to correct the situation would be to eliminate the stadium TFRs coverage in the vicinity of 0W0 so as to free up more airspace at Lake Union during stadium TFRs operations. Another less economically viable option would be to make the entire Lake Union area unavailable for operations during stadium TFRs to prevent congestion over a waterway. A third operation would be to commission a ATC tower for 0W0 making the area a Class D which would provide flight following and allow air traffic to legally pass through the TFR when it is hot.",,,,"C180 floatplane pilot reported encroaching on a sports TFR during evasive action in response to an NMAC.",

I requested a flight following to Mojave Airport with a departure to the North and a cruise altitude of 8500 ft with CNO Ground Control. I received an altitude restriction of 2000 ft; a squawk code and instruction to contact ONT tower for the northbound transition. I took off and I leveled at 2000 ft when I was instructed to contact ONT tower. I switched frequencies and there was complete congestion on the frequency with aircraft repeatedly blocking each other and the controller. I found an opportunity to check in and advised we were restricted to 2000 ft. The controller called traffic at my two o clock: a 737 climbing out of ONT. I replied: 'Aircraft X; looking for traffic.' Immediately after my reply I had the traffic in sight but I was unable to report it in sight due to frequency congestion for approximately one minute; all the while I was maintaining visual contact with the 737. Right as the 737 was about to pass overhead and above me; I was able to report it in sight to Tower and requested higher. Tower replied 'Aircraft X maintain visual separation from that traffic caution wake turbulence.' More transmissions blocked the frequency and I was unable to reply. Several seconds later when the 737 was above and behind us; still in my sight; the controller repeated 'Aircraft X maintain visual separation from that traffic caution wake turbulence.'By the time I was able to reply 'Wilco [call sign]' we had flown underneath the aircraft and were clear of it and never encountered any wake turbulence. At this point we were at a position Northwest of ONT; still in their airspace and my passenger in the right seat; a licensed pilot; called attention to traffic ahead at our same altitude in the Cable Airport traffic pattern. I saw the traffic immediately; there were at least three airplanes in the pattern which is at 2;243 MSL and we were approaching them. I was still unable to communicate with Ontario tower due to frequency congestion and I initiated a climb in the interest of safety. In the climb my passenger and I were both visually scanning for traffic and using our on-board ADS-B for additional traffic awareness. As we were overflying the final approach at Cable; Ontario tower called us and said 'Aircraft X I did not issue you a climb; you were restricted to 2000 ft. Contact SoCal Departure.' I replied 'Aircraft X switching to departure; I apologize for the climb.' Upon checking in with SoCal; they gave me a phone number to contact regarding a possible pilot deviation. Instead of continuing with our original plan; I elected to fly to Mojave and land to make the phone call as expeditiously as possible. On the phone; the controller told me the 737 had received a TCAS alert and maneuvered to avoid me.From my perspective this event was triggered mainly due the congestion on the Ontario tower frequency. The primary reason for my climb was to avoid traffic in the Cable airport traffic pattern; with which we had an imminent conflict; and we were not on their frequency. From my position I could see clearly that there would be no further conflicts if I climbed straight ahead. If this action created a TCAS RA with the 737 I sincerely apologize; but I do believe I was acting at all times in the interest of safety.",,,,"C180 pilot reported of a transition through ONT and CCB that caused an RA.

After sitting for an hour or so; the weather was clearing from west to east. A call to flight service and some brightening skies had me believing we could follow the river south at 1;500 [feet] AGL to our destination in MVFR conditions. Once airborne; the plan looked good. But 10 miles out; the controller said that some rain was ahead. With visibility better than 5; we slowed down and pushed ahead. Once in the rain; the visibility deteriorated quickly with fog developing below us.  Once we lost sight of the ground; I climbed the plane on the gauges using the terrain feature on the GPS to avoid CFIT. Once in the climb; I asked for a pop-up IFR [flight plan]. [I advised ATC]. I proceeded to an uneventful instrument approach into our destination.Scary few moments I wish not to relive. As soon as ATC mentioned rain ahead; I should have turned around. I did not. As soon as I reduce speed and dropped a few hundred feet to see ahead; I should have turned around; I did not. I should not have relied on the 'superior' abilities and decision making of the other pilot because I was PIC. I did not take action until the terrain warning system showed red to my left and right leaving me one route out. Never again.Contributing physiological factors for me included: pressure to make a dinner meeting; another pilot on board who was more confident than me about 'scud' running and a nice weather report from Flight Service briefer. My gut said to stay on the ground but I let the above cloud my judgment. A classic scenario that has killed many pilots.

Taxing out of the [parking area] I stopped and requested XX because the sock suggested it was slightly favored; although most the wind was across the runway. The controller indicated that it was unavailable due to pattern work on 28R and I believe offered me 33R or XY before issuing a clearance. I began taxiing to 33R via X-Y. As I approached the XY threshold; I was unclear in my head whether I had been cleared to cross XY and initiated braking. Due to a significant tailwind; the braking was less effective than anticipated and I pushed harder on the brakes; which caused the tail to leave the ground and the prop to strike the taxiway. This initial strike occurred before the hold short line.After the initial strike I believe I let my feet off the brakes briefly before pushing them even harder; which caused a second prop strike and the aircraft to roll up on its nose. The aircraft came to a stop roughly 10-15 feet past the hold short line. In conversation with the ATC supervisor; who had reviewed the tapes; I was told later that in fact I had been cleared to XY via X-Y. This came as a surprise to me; as the question in my mind was whether or not I had been cleared to cross or asked to hold short; which was my expectation of what the controller would have said explicitly relative to the past when a clearance to 33R would have implied a clearance to cross XY. This confusion leads me to believe that the sequence of runways discussed; plus the aircraft that was already in the pattern on 33R caused me to 'hear' something different that was actually said. I'm not sure what would have been better from a clarification perspective other than if I had heard 'hold short' 33R but that would have been non-standard for a clearance to 33R. I believe that my familiarity with the airport was actually a hindrance in this case as it may have led to my being less vigilant than would be typical if I were unfamiliar.",,,,"c180 pilot reported braking suddenly due to a confused taxi clearance; resulting in a prop-strike.",

I felt I had avoided any major damage up to that point. However; as the aircraft left the paved surface; the starboard main gear wheel sank into the dirt. This caused the nose to strike the ground. The aircraft came to a stop with the nose; starboard landing gear; and starboard wing tip supporting the aircraft with the tail about 15 feet off the ground.Major contributing factors were; gusting crosswind.

I should have reiterated my position on the runway when he asked me to repeat my tail numbers.  I do not believe I called for a southeast take off; but there was a southeast wind that I was in my mind.  I was also watching the snow removal equipment but believed he must have told them to back off on a different frequency. There was no other radio traffic until I was 8 to 10 miles away. The lake was empty and the Southeast water lane; frozen; is right in front of the Tower. He could have helped the situation if he said he could not see me. He did not see me take off at all. It was the snow worker that saw me. When I returned about an hour later the ATIS changed to MIKE and the strip was closed.  I had no issue landing on the lake to the southeast. I have flown out of ZZZ since I was a training pilot. I use the lake in the summer and occasionally in the winter. I regret this happened today; regardless that all was safe and there was no chance of any collision with truck or another plane.  It was my intention to follow ATC control; I am sorry if I heard/misinterpreted; or even possibly asked for the incorrect runway. I will certainly talk more to the Tower when they are short and listen more acutely.  I will be more certain of the runway as well and add it to my checklist as I am with wheels and skis. I have caught miscommunication from the Tower in the past coming in on floats but was able to talk it out.",,,,"A pilot departing from an airport with a hard surface runway and water lanes reported he took off from the runway but found out ATC had cleared him for takeoff from the water lane as the runway was closed for snow removal.",

At that time; I observed the RVs over the departure end turning left. At this time; I could see them on a direct course toward me; they were climbing; I was level at pattern altitude (900 feet MSL). They were basically climbing or about to climb through my altitude; my best option was to descend underneath them; as they were climbing. At that point one of the RVs; I assume the leader reported seeing me headed underneath them. After we passed; I climbed back to pastern altitude and turned downwind; the RVs continued southbound.I saw the RVs from their x-wind turn. I thought they would make a standard 45 departure from the x-wind leg prior to turning southbound but they continued south. I should have been a little more to the East so that I joined the downwind at mid-field. They should have departed on a 45 to the x-wind.

After being cleared for Runway XX; I unintentionally demonstrated a (scary) non-violent; flat ground loop upon landing. No damage to the airplane or the airport environment. The only damage was to my pride! I was fortunate that the grass was as wide as it was adjacent to the runway and that the transition from the runway edge to the grass and the grass itself was as smooth as it was. I am quite glad to have had a passenger (another pilot) in the right seat as we were able to debrief and I was able to assess the errors that created this event.1) I was carrying too much power (throttle) into the approach and upon landing. While my approach speed was correct; I failed to reduce the power to idle over the threshold. My examination of 'why I would do this' is attributed to my very recent multi-day return to flight training in a Turbo Cessna 182 which is very nose heavy and requires a bit of power to avoid sinking on final. This isn't an excuse! It is a reminder to me specifically that different aircraft require different techniques.2) I bounced. Albeit small; I bounced - caused by #1 and the fact that I landed too flat with too much momentum. I should have immediately gone.3) I didn't hold it off and I didn't have the yoke as far back as needed. I was trained to verbally say to myself 'hold it off; hold it off; hold it off' - I have gotten out of the habit and have re-instituted it.4) I wasn't lined up and there was a small crosswind. Crosswind landings are an area for me to work on. My passenger noticed a difference between the windsock at the approach end of the runway which was straight down the runway (my observation) with a calm to slight wind and the mid field sock indicating a 45 degree crosswind at about 7 to 8 knots. I didn't observe this as it was on the right side of the aircraft my view was obscured by the round out and flare (albeit flatter than required)Those are the ingredients in the recipe for inducing a ground loop - plain and simple.As I was able to taxi back following this incident with no physical damage to anyone or anything; there were a few things I did right...1) I did not panic - panicking never makes things better - that is not to say it wasn't serious - one of the scariest moments in my flying career for sure!2) I kept my heels firmly planted on the floor and did not apply the brakes. 3) Once it was clear that the rudder walk was not going to correct this situation; I put my full concentration into managing the energy and keeping the wings level so we could ride it out - the aircraft did end up rotating about 180 degrees in a decent sized arc - thank goodness for ample room and smooth terrain.I am a big believer of getting back on the horse when you fall off (doesn't mean I wasn't nervous or finding it hard not to think about it too much and psych myself out). I took some time to review some videos I have for Tailwheel Essentials. After all; I was bringing the aircraft back the following day and would need to land safely at home.I am glad to report that it was a good landing as I was lined up; on glide slope; with the correct approach speed; idle at the threshold and I held it off and pinned the tail to the runway with full back pressure - a nice three point landing. So I proved to myself once again that I can do it; and can do it safely. I have arranged some additional remedial training with a Tailwheel CFI to reorient my brain and strengthen my muscle memory.I consider myself extremely fortunate to have learned a VERY valuable lesson that I WILL NOT forget; with only a small loss of pride and a degree of embarrassment!",,,,"Cessna 180 Pilot reported a runway excursion during landing caused by loss of directional control.

I departed VFR but when I was about 30 miles from ZZZ I decided I'd need an IFR approach to ZZZ because of clouds (OVC 019; tops 045). I asked for a clearance to the RNAV XX and was given direct ZZZZZ; maintain VFR; expect clearance at ZZZZZ1 (an IF but straight-in to the FAF). I accepted this. It became apparent I'd be in IMC before ZZZZZ1 so I advised ATC and was given a clearance for the approach; direct ZZZZZ; maintain 040. I had already loaded and briefed the approach; and the AP was flying in NAV mode.ATC then gave me a vector; I think for jet traffic. I switched the AP to TRK mode (it doesn't do HDG; just TRK) and attempted to enter a track that approximated the heading; but couldn't get the AP to accept it. I'm new to the airplane (45 hrs so far) and the AP; and have only flown one approach with the AP. I decided to disconnect the AP and hand-fly. I thought I had disconnected the AP (it has a knob that is used to both arm and disconnect the AP) but I had not; and I failed to verify on the status display that the AP was disconnected. The AP continued to fly the airplane while I attempted to hand-fly. The AP turned the airplane toward higher terrain. The airplane turned 180 degrees before I realized the AP was not disconnected and I was fighting the AP and the airplane was banked 30 degrees and perhaps 15 degrees nose-down. I turned off the power to the AP; recovered to straight-and-level; and then hand-flew us back onto the vector. The controller was calm; advising me of my heading and to turn to the heading he gave me. He then vectored me through the final approach course and back around to intercept the final approach course. This took probably three minutes. The controller switched me to tower and I keyed in what I thought was the tower freq from the approach plate but was actually ZZZ1 Center. I made the initial call-up and got a confusing response from the controller. About this time we broke out of IMC and I focused on ensuring we were configured to land. I tried tower again and got no response. I checked the plate again and realized the Center freq was similar to the tower freq and I'd keyed in the wrong freq. I put in the proper freq and was cleared to land. Landing was uneventful.I turned off onto the taxiway and stopped; and performed the after-landing flow. I over-leaned the engine and the engine died. Ground informed me that I had not crossed the hold-short line (it's in a non-standard place as the taxiway is at an angle) and then canceled the takeoff clearance of the aircraft holding short for departure. I re-started the engine; taxied clear. Tower informed me of a possible pilot deviation and gave me a number to call. I called the number and talked to the TRACON Supervisor about the incident.The primary factor in this incident was my relative unfamiliarity with the AP. I can certainly use the AP in VMC; but I need to know the AP better to rely on it in IMC. A contributing factor was my failure to confirm AP status after making a change to the AP. Another contributing factor is that the AP is independent - it does not take headings from the HSI not altitudes or barometer settings from the AI. A final contributing factor is that I experienced spatial disorientation and had not realized though my senses that the airplane was banked and nose-down. I do believe my experience as an instrument instructor led me to make the proper decision to disconnect the AP and hand-fly. My training to fly pitch attitude and keep the wings level; or banked standard-rate for a turn; prevented this from becoming a loss-of-control-in-IMC crash.I'm very experienced in type aircraft. This approach would've been routine for me in a type airplane.Finally; my failure to S-turn the airplane once on the ground to confirm I had cleared the hold-short lines was the primary factor in not clearing the runway (the C180 is a taildragger and the pilot cannot see the ground in front of the airplane. A contributing factor was my distraction from the difficulty of the approach and relief at being on the ground. As an instructor; I remind my students that landings after difficult approaches are often poor as you're so relieved at having gotten through the approach; and you cannot relax until after the landing. I need to revise that to include confirming being off the runway; and to use S-turns in a taildragger.",,,,"Pilot reported a loss of aircraft control in IMC on approach after they mistakenly thought they had disconnected the autopilot. Pilot eventually disconnected the AP and completed the approach. Pilot also stated they overleaned the engine after landing; causing it to die while the airplane was not completely clear of the runway.",

The aircraft is a 1955 C-180.  At the time; the aircraft was very light. One pilot; minimal fuel; no cargo. 8.50 x 6.00 tires at 26 psi. On approach to Runway XXR; final wind reported as 10/350.  Earlier winds were reported 10-G15. This is my home base; and these wind conditions are not unusual.  As expected for early weather reports obtained in route. Due to the cross-wind; I landed with the upwind wing low. 30 degrees of flap.  I initially landed on the right main wheel; then let the left wheel settle as my speed decreased. I was firmly in a wheel landing with ailerons toward the crosswind. Estimated airspeed around 45mph. As I slowed further; I put the tail down too aggressively.  My intention was to pin the tail wheel to prevent weathervaning in the crosswind. Unfortunately; lowering the tail too rapidly induced a right turning tendency; this force coupled with increased lift due to the change in angle of attack and the crosswind; resulting in the right wing lifting. I had 30 degrees of flaps deployed. These combined forces began a ground loop.  As the left wing touched the ground; I applied full left brake momentarily; and the aircraft came back onto both wheels; and departed the runway into the grass on a course of approximately 360.  Left wing tip was damaged. No other part of the airplane was damaged. The airport was closed for 20 minutes while the airport authority checked the runway for debris.  None was found.  Aircraft was taxied to hangar. The failure was a combination of overconfidence; and failure maintain directional control when lowering the tail from a wheel landing.

I found the bolt to be excessively worn so the cables remained detached while a replacement bolt was on order. When the new clevis bolt arrived I installed it into the control stick securing only the upper cable. After installation I moved the control stick to actuate the elevator and it seemed to work properly because the attached cable moved the elevator up and gravity pulled the elevator back down. Flight control freedom of movement was also checked by two other A&P Mechanics and the pilot before flight. The lower elevator control cable is routed from the control stick through a tube and then down around a pulley. When the problem was discovered; the lower cable end was hidden inside the tube. I believe the hidden cable is one factor that lead to my mistake. Another factor is my failure to request a secondary maintenance check. The problem was initially discovered by the pilot just after takeoff when he realized he had no control of the elevator. The plane was then landed with no damage or injuries. After landing a flight control inspection revealed a very loose elevator cable under the pilot seat and the inspector followed the cable forward to find the end inside the tube but not connected to the control stick as it should be. I then installed the lower cable along with the upper cable to the control stick with the clevis bolt.

I proceeded to reduce power and add full forward trim which lowered the nose of the aircraft. It became clear that the plane did not have elevator control. I proceeded to keep the engine in normal operating range; trim full forward and circle back to the runway I had departed. I landed with the use of flaps and full aft trim (to flare) leaving the stick full forward. The landing was uneventful. I taxied over to Maintenance.

I contacted ZZZ Approach 40 miles away and though it was severe clear VMC; I requested a practice approach RNAV XX with IAF at ZZZZZ. I was given a squawk code and ultimately '...cleared for the practice approach; no traffic separation provided.' I continued inbound to the IAF (ZZZZZ) then proceeded to turn onto the final approach course. Aircraft Y checked in and was cleared for the visual to Runway XX. ZZZ called out me as traffic for the airliner and they said they had me in sight. He was behind and above me; so I could not see him. I continued from the IAF toward the FAF. I had a couple call outs from ZZZ for the traffic at 8 o'clock; then 7 o'clock to which I responded that I was a high wing and would not be able to see the traffic. The final couple call outs to me was for the traffic at 12 o'clock and one mile; then twelve o'clock at 1/2 mile; which made no sense. I told Approach I did not have the traffic in sight despite the fact I was told they were very close at twelve o'clock. In actuality; they were at my six o'clock position; not twelve. Meanwhile; I am starting to descend on the glide slope; fortunately was below the center of the glide slope and I see the airliner pass directly over me at about the location of the FAF. It was night; and so very difficult to ascertain vertical separation; but it was uncomfortably close. I told Approach that Aircraft Y  passed directly over me and they switched me to the Tower. I told Tower I was too close to Aircraft Y and needed to do a 360 degree turn which was approved. Although cleared for the visual; I'm sure Aircraft Y was likely tracking the ILS for Runway XX which put him on the same glide slope as me. This was a very dangerous scenario; with a low wing Aircraft Y overtaking from above a high wing aircraft; both of which were descending on the same glide path. There is no way Aircraft Y could maintain visual separation with me as it passed over me. Had I corrected my low position on the glide path; I could have ascending into the descending Aircraft Y and a mid air collision could have occurred. The Approach Controller incorrectly called out the traffic at 12 o'clock rather than 6 o'clock. Had he correctly stated its position; I would have at least told them that there is no way for me to 'see and avoid' the traffic that was overtaking me on the same glide path.

I was piloting Aircraft X; a 1955 Cessna 180. The preflight and run up showed nothing abnormal; including three prop cycles from the run up RPM of 1;700 down to about 1;300 or 1;400 RPM. We departed ZZZ4 with radar flight following; and climbed to 9;500 ft. MSL across the state. During climb and cruise at 9;500 ft.; all engine parameters were normal; and the propeller control functioned normally when adjusted for a cruise RPM of 2;200. Approaching Location; I initiated a climb to 13;500 ft. at an indicated airspeed of about 90 MPH; with throttle wide open and prop RPM adjusted for 2;450 (cruise climb setting). The climb seemed normal; but as we leveled off at 13;500 ft.; about 5 or 10 miles east of ZZZ; the propeller RPM slowly increased above the red line of 2;600 RPM as the plane accelerated. Our JPI engine monitor flashed red as the red line was exceeded; so I immediately throttled back to a low power setting to keep the RPM below red line. I also immediately turned back toward the lower elevation; and away from the mountains; since propeller over-speed is sometimes caused by loss of engine oil pressure. I exercised the propeller control; and found that it had no effect on reducing or controlling propeller RPM. However; the engine oil pressure was normal and stable. I told ZZZ Approach about our propeller problem; and that I would descend for landing somewhere in the lower elevation area. We initiated a low-speed low-power descent; to keep the RPM below red line; and proceeded toward ZZZ1 which was soon within gliding range. During the descent; oil pressure and temperature remained steady and normal; so I decided to proceed to ZZZ2 airport; with a longer runway and where I hoped that maintenance services might be available. As we descended to ZZZ2; I considered my approach and landing; and not knowing the root cause of the problem; decided that I would like to have priority for landing; so that I wouldn't be vectored for traffic or possibly be instructed to go-around. So; I told ZZZ that I would like to [request priority handling]. ZZZ acknowledged this; and requested souls and fuel on board; and soon handed us over to ZZZ Tower. ZZZ Tower cleared us for a straight in approach to Runway XXR; but since we were still very high on the approach; I requested right downwind for XXR; and proceeded to lose altitude as we maneuvered onto the downwind.

After passing that airport I was showing a passenger some functionality of the avionics system and inadvertently adjusted the barometric pressure changing my displayed altitude. I did not notice that change as I was looking to see was something different when the adjustment of the knob was made. I thought I was changing the heading bug but it was not moving; The multi-function knob on the primary flight display was set to BARO vs. HDG. Shortly after showing this functionality; we were descending to a lower altitude. Because of the inadvertent change in barometer setting; my altitude over the ground (river) may have been lower than I wanted based on the altimeter setting. During the decent; I set the Altitude bug to an altitude that would of been several hundred feet above the 500 foot minimum altitude per CFR 91. This is a great function of the system because it provides a 'leaving Altitude' aural warning at +/- 200 feet.  Because of the inadvertent change to the barometric pressure; we were lower that expected and there should of been an aural warning indicating I was lower that planned. I noticed we seemed low; applied power; and gained altitude; received a new ATIS from ZZZ1 and noticed the BARO was off by quite a bit. It was adjusted to the corrected to the proper barometric pressure and we continued to a landing in ZZZ1. After the landing I reviewed how this could of happened and narrowed the mistake down to the multi-function knob and the event noted above.  To mitigate the risk of the inadvertent change of altitude in the future I have eliminated using the optional 'BARO' functionality from the multi-function knob on the primary flight display. This has reduced locations I will change the altitude from multiple areas and reduced it to only two. The 'BARO' knob and the touch screen on the primary flight display. Both of these are specific to the BARO adjustment and not a multi-function change. Adjusting with the he touch screen; it is very evident you are making a barometric altitude change and not something that can be accidentally changed. The other is the BARO knob; that knob is in a location that is specific to making a change to the barometric pressure and is not a multi-function knob. Several other steps that have been implemented is when changing the BARO; verify altitude on the STANDBY indicator and also the GPS feed on the iPad. Another verification step will be prior to any planned changed in altitude the current altimeter settings will be verified prior to the altitude change on the multiple sources.",,,,"Cessna-180 pilot reported while showing a passenger some different functionalities of the avionics system; the altimeter Baro was accidentally changed.

My intent was to perform stop-and-go landings; so I didn't want anyone immediately behind me in the VFR pattern. Turning from crosswind to downwind; I make a position report and heard someone call 'following the Color X Cessna'. I stated I was a Color Y Cessna Skywagon established on downwind; noting to myself that I had not heard a Cessna call on the 45 entry. After about 20 seconds on downwind for Runway XX; I saw the Color X Cessna 140 on the 45 entry to the downwind. The aircraft was at my two o'clock; slightly low; close enough to read the N Number. Being slightly above traffic pattern altitude at that time; I initiated an immediate climb and a right turn toward the 140's six o'clock position. I felt that had I not maneuvered immediately and aggressively; a collision would have occurred as the conflict aircraft made no indication that they saw me.

I estimated a collision imminent within 2-3 seconds; so I took immediate evasive action by executing a left break turn with a descent.
