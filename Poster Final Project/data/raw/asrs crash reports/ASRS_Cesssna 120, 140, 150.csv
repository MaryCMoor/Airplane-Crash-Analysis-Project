I HAD JUST TAKEN OFF FROM CAMARILLO ARPT (CMA) ENRTE TO SANTA MONICA (SMO). MY RTE OF FLT TOOK ME DIRECTLY OVER NAS POINT MERGER (NTD). AFTER TAKING OFF FROM CMA I CALLED NTD TWR TO TRANSITION THEIR CLASS D AIRSPACE. THE TRANSITION WAS APPROVED; MY ALT VERIFIED AND EVERYTHING WAS PROCEEDING NORMALLY. THE TWR WAS BUSY AND ONE OF THE CTLRS (THERE WERE 2 VOICES) WAS OBVIOUSLY IN TRAINING. THE TWR POINTED OUT AN A-6 ON DOWNWIND FOR RWY 21 AND I WAS TOLD HE WOULD BE LNDG. SHORTLY AFTER THAT I HEARD THE INSTRUCTOR CTLR SAY SOMETHING ABOUT SOMEBODY HAVING AN UNSAFE GEAR INDICATION AND THAT ACFT WAS INSTRUCTED TO CLB TO 2200 FT (I WAS AT 1700 FT) AND TURN L TO OVERFLY THE ARPT. THIS MADE ME A LITTLE MORE ALERT AS I STARTED LOOKING AROUND. THE A-6 I HAD POINTED OUT TO ME STARTED A L TURN TO WHAT LOOKED LIKE A BASE LEG. IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE WAS ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH ME THAT I NOTICED HE WAS CLBING! MOST PEOPLE KNOW AN A-6 EASILY OUT CLBS A CESSNA 150. I TURNED ABOUT 120 DEGS TO THE R AND HAD THE A-6 COME WITHIN 1000 FT OR SO. I REALIZE THAT BEING VFR I WAS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN MY OWN SEPARATION FROM THE A-6; AND I AM NOT SUGGESTING THAT TWRS START PROVIDING SEPARATION TO VFR ACFT. HOWEVER; THERE ARE A FEW CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THIS 'INCIDENT.' THE A-6 WAS TALKING TO THE TWR ON UHF AND I WAS ON VHF. SO I HAD NO IDEA WHAT HE WAS SAYING AS I WOULD HAVE IF BOTH OF US WERE ON THE SAME FREQ. I THINK CTLRS NEED TO BE CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT MANY PLTS RELY ON SITUATIONAL AWARENESS DEVELOPED FROM THE RADIO CONVERSATIONS. WHEN A CTLR WORKS MULTIPLE FREQS; HE NEEDS TO BE AWARE THAT HE MAY NEED TO TALK A LITTLE MORE TO OTHER AIRPLANES SINCE THEY ONLY GET WHAT THE CTLR SAYS. FINALLY; I BELIEVE THE CTLR IN THE EVENT I HAVE DESCRIBED MAY HAVE FOCUSED MORE ON TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE A-6'S GEAR PROB AND FORGOTTEN ABOUT HIS DUTY TO THE SAFE AND ORDERLY FLOW OF TFC. CTLRS MAY NEED TO BE REMINDED NOW AND THEN AS PLTS ARE TO 'FLY THE AIRPLANE FIRST.' CTLRS SHOULD PROVIDE FOR THE SAFE FLOW OF TFC THROUGH THEIR AIRSPACE. AGAIN; I AM AWARE THAT THIS OCCURRENCE WASN'T THE FAULT OF THE CTLR; AND THAT IF THERE WAS A COLLISION; THE FAULT WOULD HAVE RESTED WITH ME AND THE A-6 PLT.

THE STUDENT'S PATTERN WAS WIDE. WHEN WE TURNED TO FINAL AT ABOUT 500 AGL; WE WERE TOO FAR AWAY TO MAKE THE FIELD. BOTH THE STUDENT AND I RECOGNIZED THIS. I INSTRUCTED HIM TO INITIATE A GAR. AS HE WAS PUSHING IN THE THROTTLE; HE ENTERED A VERY SHALLOW R BANK. I DID NOT CORRECT THE BANK OR TELL THE STUDENT TO DO SO WHEN I FIRST NOTICED IT. HE WAS AN ADVANCED STUDENT PREPARING FOR HIS PVT CHKRIDE. I DIDN'T FEEL I SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CORRECT EVERY SMALL ERROR HE MADE. THE ENG DIDN'T RESPOND TO THE THROTTLE. WHEN I REALIZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING; I TOOK THE CTLS; CORRECTED THE BANK AND AIMED FOR THE ONLY CLRING I SAW. THE AIRSTRIP WAS TOO FAR AWAY TO BE CONSIDERED AS AN OPTION. I INITIATED THE RESTART PROCS; BUT DID NOT COMPLETE THEM. I NOTICED MY AIRSPD GETTING TOO SLOW AND THE TREES BELOW APCHING RAPIDLY. I CONCENTRATED MY EFFORTS ON MAINTAINING BEST GLIDE SPD OVER THE TREES TO THE CLRING. THE LNDG GEAR CLIPPED THE TOPS OF THE TREES JUST BEFORE THE CLRING. I LANDED AS SLOWLY AS POSSIBLE; TAIL LOW. THE NOSE GEAR HIT A BERM AND COLLAPSED. THE ACFT SLID ON ITS NOSE A SHORT DISTANCE UNTIL IT HIT ANOTHER BERM AND ROLLED OVER NOSE FIRST. WE STOPPED UPSIDE DOWN.

I PROBABLY HAD THE THROTTLE SET TOO LOW FOR THOSE CONDITIONS. I'VE BEEN TOLD SINCE THAT 1500 RPM IS THE LOWEST SAFE SETTING IN WINTER. THE STUDENT TOLD ME LATER THAT HIS INSTRUCTOR HAD ALWAYS TOLD HIM TO TURN OFF THE CARB HEAT AND THEN ADD THE PWR. IN WARMER CLIMATES; THAT'S NOT A PROB. IN AK; IT IS. HE MAY HAVE TURNED OFF THE CARB HEAT BEFORE ADDING PWR. ANOTHER STUDENT WHO HAD BEEN FLYING THAT ACFT LATER SAID THAT IT HAD BEEN RUNNING ROUGH AND BACKFIRING ON TOUCH AND GOES AND GARS (HE ALWAYS ADDS PWR FIRST AND THEN TURNS OFF THE CARB HEAT).

I WAS INSTRUCTING A STUDENT ON HIS FIRST DUAL XCOUNTRY AND FELT HIS WAS NOT THE PROPER WAY TO INTRODUCE HIM TO CLASS B AIRSPACE. THE MECHANICAL CONDITION OF THIS OLD CESSNA 152 AND ITS INSTS WERE A FACTOR. IT IS INDEED SAD THAT CESSNA CANNOT MAKE NEW SINGLE ENG ACFT.

THE ENRTE FLT FROM SINTON TO MCALLEN WAS ROUTINE AND WITHOUT INCIDENT. THE WX WAS GENERALLY GOOD VFR BUT BECAME A LITTLE HAZIER AS I APCHED MCALLEN. I WAS GIVEN RADAR VECTOR ASSISTANCE AND LOCATED THE ARPT ABOUT 4 MI AWAY AT MY 11 O'CLOCK POS. I WAS INSTRUCTED TO CONTACT THE TWR AND I DID. I WAS CLRED TO LAND ON RWY 13 AND I COMPLIED. FOLLOWING THE LNDG; I WAS INSTRUCTED TO DEPART THE RWY ON TXWY BRAVO. I REQUESTED THAT GND CTL PROVIDE ME WITH PROGRESSIVE TAXI INSTRUCTIONS TO FBO. I TAXIED TO FBO AND REFUELED. AT THE TIME OF MY DEP THE TWR HAD CHANGED THE RWY FROM RWY 13 TO RWY 31. I ONCE AGAIN ASKED FOR PROGRESSIVE TAXI INSTRUCTIONS FROM MCALLEN GND CTL. AS I WAS TAXIING OUT ON TXWY CHARLIE THE VOICE OF GND CTLR WAS THAT OF A WOMAN. I TAXIED OUT TO THE INTXN OF TXWY CHARLIE AND TXWY ALPHA WHICH RUNS PARALLEL TO THE ACTIVE RWY 31. AS I WAS APCHING THE INTXN; THE VOICE ON THE RADIO CHANGED FROM THAT OF A WOMAN TO THAT OF A MAN. IN THINKING BACK UPON WHAT HAPPENED NEXT; I MUST HAVE MENTALLY MADE AN ASSUMPTION THAT I WAS NOW TALKING TO THE CTL TWR RATHER THAN GND CTL. I CANNOT RECALL IF I CHANGED FREQ ON THE RADIO. HAVING THE BENEFIT OF SUBSEQUENTLY REVIEWING WHAT HAPPENED AT MCALLEN IN A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH MCALLEN TWR; I NOW KNOW THAT I WAS ASKED IF I WANTED TO USE THE ENTIRE RWY OR IF I WOULD ACCEPT AN INTXN TKOF. (IN WHICH I WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO TAXI STRAIGHT AHEAD ACROSS TXWY ALPHA; THEN TURN R DOWN RWY 31 AND TKOF.) THE MCALLEN TWR TOLD ME ON THE TELEPHONE THAT I DIDN'T REPLY WHEN I WAS ASKED IF I WANTED AN INTXN TKOF; AND I PROBABLY DID NOT SINCE I HAD NEVER MADE AN INTXN TKOF AND WAS CONFUSED AT THIS TIME. WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS HOW THE TWR OR GND CTL COULD ASSUME I UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS XMITTED IF I DIDN'T REPLY. I WAS ASKED IF I WAS READY FOR TKOF AND REPLIED THAT I WAS. I WAS ASKED THIS SAME QUESTION A SECOND TIME AND AGAIN A THIRD TIME; AND BOTH TIMES I REPLIED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. WHEN THE TWR OPERATOR ASKED ME THE THIRD TIME; BEING CONFUSED; I MUST HAVE ASSUMED THIS WAS HIS WAY OF TELLING ME I WAS CLRED FOR TKOF. I WAS REALLY CONFUSED AND INTIMIDATED. WHEN HE ASKED ME THE THIRD TIME IF I WAS READY FOR TKOF; I REPLIED YES AND RELEASED THE BRAKES; TURNED TO THE R TO A HDG OF 310 DEGS. TXWY ALPHA IS A WIDE AND LONG TXWY AND COMPARES TO THE RWY I USED FOR THE SIGNIFICANT PART OF MY TRAINING. AS SOON AS I ROTATED AND WAS LIFTING OFF I REALIZED I HAD MADE A MISTAKE AND TAKEN OFF FROM A TXWY BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUOUS YELLOW LINE DOWN THE TXWY. THERE WAS NO TFC ON RWY 31 OR ON TXWY ALPHA IN FRONT OF ME. BECAUSE THE OF FACT THAT I WAS ALREADY AIRBORNE; I DECIDED TO CONTINUE AND TO LINE UP WITH RWY 31. I LOOKED BACK BEHIND ME AND IN FRONT AND SAW NO ACFT DEPARTING FROM RWY 31. I BANKED THE ACFT L; FLEW OVER TO RWY; AND THEN TURNED TO THE R TO ALINE THE ACFT WITH RWY 31. I CONTINUED TO CLB STRAIGHT OUT ON A HDG O 310 DEGS WHICH IS THE HDG TO LAREDO INTL ARPT. AS I WAS CLBING OUT; I WAS CONTACTED BY RADIO ON THE SAME FREQ I USED PRIOR TO TKOF (I NOW REALIZE IT; I STILL DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS GND CTL OR TWR) AND NOTIFIED THAT I HAD MADE AN UNCLRED TKOF AND THAT I HAD TAKEN OFF FROM A TXWY (THIS I ALREADY KNEW). I WAS GIVEN A TELEPHONE NUMBER AND ASKED TO CALL MCALLEN TWR WHEN I REACHED MY NEXT DEST AT LAREDO INTL. MY FLT INSTRUCTOR CONTACTED MR. X OF THE SAN ANTONIO FSDO AND REVIEWED THIS MATTER WITH HIM.

I THEN REQUESTED CTR GIVE ME TIME; DISTANCE; AND GND SPD TO MCL. CTR GAVE ME 25 MI TO MCL 25 MINS AND GND SPD OF 70 KTS. AT 20 MI AND 20 MINS OUT I INFORMED CTR THAT IT APPEARED THAT MY FUEL WAS MARGINAL AND I WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A STRAIGHT IN APCH AND SET UP A CRUISE DSCNT; CHK LEAN AND PWR AND CONTINUED. AFTER CTR'S LAST CALL AT 15 MI 15 MINS AND 70 KTS GND SPD; I CONTINUED FOR ABOUT 3 OR 4 MINS AND EXHAUSTED MY FUEL. I CALLED CTR AND ADVISED THEM THAT I WAS OUT OF FUEL AND PUTTING DOWN IN A FIELD.

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

I WAS RADAR VECTORED FOR APPROX 20 MINS BUT NEVER GIVEN THE APCH. FROM THE RADAR VECTORS I RECEIVED; 350 DEGS ; 310 DEGS; I ASSUMED I WAS TO RECEIVE THE ILS TO TORRANCE ARPT. AFTER APPROX 20 MINS OF NOT BEING CLRED FOR THE APCH; I RECEIVED A CHANGE OF ATC OPERATORS; AND I NOW HAD A FEMALE ATC OPERATOR WHO GAVE ME A HDG OR RADAR VECTOR WHICH LEAD ME AGAIN TO BELIEVE I WAS HEADED FOR THE ILS TO TORRANCE ARPT. AT THAT TIME I REQUESTED VECTORS AND A DSCNT FROM VFR ON TOP THROUGH IFR CLOUD LAYER TO VFR FOR LNDG AT TORRANCE ARPT WHICH WAS RPTING VFR. COAST APCH CONTINUED TO CALL TFC FOR ME; AND I AGAIN REQUESTED TO GET DOWN. FINALLY THEY CLRED ME TO 2000 FT BUT NO CLRNC FOR THE APCH. AFTER APPROX A HALF AN HR; I AGAIN REQUESTED COULD THEY GET US DOWN TO LAND. THE FEMALE ATC OPERATOR FINALLY TOLD ME THEY COULD NOT GET ME DOWN THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND SUGGESTED I CONTACT LA APCH ON 124.3. I ATTEMPTED TO DO THAT WITH NO RESPONSE. I THEN CONTACTED TORRANCE TWR TO SEE IF THEY COULD HELP. I TOLD THEM I WAS VFR ON TOP; I HAD INFO SIERRA; THE FIELD WAS VFR; I WAS TOLD TO SQUAWK 0200 AND TO MAKE A R TFC FOR RWY 11R AND TO RPT DOWNWIND. I TOLD THEM AGAIN I WAS ON TOP AND COULD THEY TELL ME IF THERE WERE ANY HOLES. THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT HELP ME; AND THAT I SHOULD CONTACT COAST APCH OR REMAIN VFR NW AND TALK TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. APPARENTLY SOMEONE FROM THE TWR TALKED TO COAST AND WAS TOLD COAST CAN WORK YOU NOW ON 127.2. I CONTACTED SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WAS TOLD TO STAND BY. APPROX 5 MINS LATER; THEY BEGAN VECTORING ME SUPPOSEDLY FOR FINAL; 270 DEGS; 250 DEGS; AND 2000 FT AND THEN 110 DEGS TO JOIN FINAL. THE NEXT VECTOR WAS 090 DEGS AND JOIN FINAL; THEN CLRED FOR APCH CONTACT TWR. UNABLE THE VISUAL; INSTRUCTED TO CLB IMMEDIATELY TO 1500 FTFROM 700 FT.

AT THIS TIME THE CTLR ADVISED 1600 FT; 2 MI FROM LASKE; CLRED FOR THE APCH. FINAL VECTOR WAS 1600 FT; L 090 DEGS. AT WHICH TIME ATC SAID; 'IF YOU CAN'T GET IT THIS TIME YOU WILL HAVE TO GO ELSEWHERE. THIS IS RIDICULOUS.' FOLLOWED BY 'SAY INTENTIONS.' I WAS UNABLE TO FINISH THE APCH ON THE VISUAL AND WAS TOLD TO CLB; MAINTAIN 1800; THEN 2000 FT; YOU'RE BELOW MDA. THEY ASKED IF I WAS VFR; AND AT THE TIME I WAS IN THE CLOUDS. RADAR VECTORED THEN 270 DEGS; 3000 FT. I ADVISED ATC I HAD A 'LOW FUEL STATUS.' THEY WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO DSND BECAUSE OF THE HILLS. I TOLD THEM I WAS VFR; AND THEY INSTRUCTED ME 'FREQ CHANGE APPROVED.' SEVERAL MINS LATER I TOLD THEM; 'MY ENG IS CUTTING OUT; GIVE ME RADAR VECTORS.' I WAS TOLD 'NO; WE CAN'T VECTOR YOU; YOU ARE 3 MI N OF THE FIELD. CONTACT THE TWR. AT XX30; 'WE DECLARED A MAYDAY TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; SAME ATC PERSON; AND THAT WE WERE OUT OF FUEL.' NO REPLY FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THEN THEY CAME BACK AND SAID 'IDENT' IF THAT'S YOU; CALL THE TWR.' I MADE NO FURTHER CALLS TO THEM; AND PROCEEDED TOWARD THE FIELD WITHOUT AN ENG. I WAS HEADED TOWARD A BROWN BUILDING; NW OF TORRANCE FIELD; WHICH WAS LATER IDENTIFIED TO ME AS TORRANCE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL; WHEN BY SWITCHING TANKS AND FUEL PUMPS ON AND OFF BY THE OTHER PLT WITH ME; I MANAGED TO GET THE ENG RESTARTED AND WAS ABLE TO MISS THE BUILDING AND LAND; TAXI OFF THE RWY WHEN THE ENG CAUGHT FOR THE LAST TIME. I THEN CONTACTED GND AND TOLD THEM I NEEDED A TOW; BECAUSE I WAS OUT OF FUEL. THEY TOWED ME TO FUEL WHERE I PUMPED IN 85.1 GALLONS OF FUEL. MY PLANE HOLDS 90 GALLONS OF USABLE FUEL. I CHKED BOTH TANKS PRIOR TO FUELING AND THEY WERE EMPTY. APPARENTLY THERE WAS ENOUGH FUEL IN THE SYS TO RESTART MY ENG. I WAS TOLD TO COME TO THE TWR AND THEN CALL COAST APCH AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I MET WITH THE ACTING TWR MGR AND ANSWERED HIS QUESTIONS. HE SAID HE WOULD MAKE AN INVESTIGATION. I LATER HAD SOMEONE CALL THE TWR FOR ME; AND I FOUND OUT THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NEVER CALLED THE TWR TO NOTIFY THEM I WAS INBOUND WITHOUT AN ENG; AND THAT I HAD NOT CONTACTED THEM. THEY WERE UNAWARE OF MY MAYDAY STATUS; AND THERE WAS NO EMER EQUIP CALLED FOR OR ON THE FIELD. AT THE TIME MY ENG QUIT; I WAS APPROX 1 MI N OF THE FIELD; AND THERE WAS NO TIME TO DO ANYTHING BUT FLY THE ACFT AND ATTEMPT TO RESTART THE ENG TO AVOID LNDG ON HOUSES AND BUSINESSES. APPARENTLY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DID NOT FEEL THEY HAD ANY OBLIGATION TO EITHER HELP ME IN AN EMER SIT NOR TO NOTIFY THE FIELD I HAD DECLARED AN EMER. MY REACTIONS TO THIS WHOLE MATTER ARE; I KNEW I HAD ABOUT 1 HR AND A LITTLE MORE FUEL ON BOARD. I WAS GETTING NO HELP FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO HELP. THE PEOPLE WHO DID HELP; THE TWR; AREN'T ALLOWED TO DO WHAT I NEEDED. WHEN I HAD AN EMER STATUS; I RECEIVED NO HELP. WHEN I DECLARED AN EMER WITH MY MAYDAY AND OUT OF FUEL; ENG STOPPED; THE PROPER PROCS OF IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE WERE NOT RECEIVED. WHEN I AGAIN ASKED FOR HELP FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AFTER MY MAYDAY; THEY GAVE ME A FREQ CHANGE.

HE GETS MAD EVERY TIME HE THINKS ABOUT THE ENG QUITTING AND HIS BEING HEADED TOWARD THE HOSPITAL BUILDING. IT WAS SO UNNECESSARY. HE TRIED TO FILE IFR; HE WAS NEVER DENIED BUT JUST VECTORED ALL OVER THE SKY. HE THOUGHT HE WAS BEING VECTORED FOR THE APCH EACH TIME. ON THE PHONE AFTER THE INCIDENT APCH CTLR TOLD HIM THEY COULD NOT GIVE HIM A LET DOWN OVER LAND BELOW 2000 FT AND CEILING WAS 1100 FT. HE IS REALLY ANNOYED BECAUSE THEY KNEW FROM THE START THAT THEY COULD NOT GET HIM DOWN. AT FIRST THEY WERE GOING TO CLR FOR AN ILS ON RWY 29 WITH OTHER TFC LNDG ON RWY 11.

WHEN I WAS HANDED OVER TO THE TWR FROM APCH CTL; MY LNDG APCH INSTRUCTIONS WERE TO RPT A 2 MI R BASE FOR RWY 27. WINDS WERE 260 DEGS AT 11 KTS. I RPTED ON THE 2 MI BASE AS INSTRUCTED AND WAS GIVEN A CLRNC TO LAND. ALSO INCLUDED IN MY CLRNC WAS AN INSTRUCTION TO SQUARE MY TURN TO FINAL WHICH I COMPLIED WITH. THEN WHILE STILL ON THE BASE LEG I PERFORMED MY PRE-LNDG CHKLIST AND BEGAN TO CONFIGURE THE ACFT FOR LNDG. IMMEDIATELY AFTER TURNING FINAL I STARTED SCANNING THE INTERSECTING RWY 35 FOR TFC. RWY 35 IS KALAMAZOO'S MAIN INST RWY. RWY 35/17 IS USED BY ALL THE COMMUTER AIRLINES SVCING THE ARPT. AS I LOOKED DOWN TO THE APCH END OF RWY 35 THERE WAS A COMMUTER ACFT HOLDING SHORT OF THE RWY. AS I CONTINUED MY APCH THE COMMUTER ACFT WAS GIVEN CLRNC TO TAXI IN POS AND HOLD. AT THIS POINT I WAS A MI OUT AND STILL HAD CLRNC TO LAND. AT A 1/2 MI AND 300 FT AGL; THE COMMUTER ACFT WAS GIVEN CLRNC TO TKOF. WITHOUT DELAY I EXECUTED A GAR. MY APCH SPD WAS 70 KTS. I TURNED SHARPLY TO THE S IN AN ATTEMPT TO PASS BEHIND THE COMMUTER ACFT. 5-7 SECONDS ELAPSED BTWN THE TIME THE COMMUTER ACFT WAS GIVEN CLRNC FOR TKOF AND WHEN I CALLED THE TWR INFORMING THEM I WAS GOING AROUND. WHEN I PASSED OVER THE INTXN OF RWYS 35 AND 27 I WAS DIRECTLY OVERHEAD OF THE COMMUTER ACFT (ABOUT 300-350 FT) AND THE OTHER ACFT HAD JUST LEFT THE GND AND CLBING.

I USUALLY LAND 500-700 FT DOWN FROM THE THRESHOLD OR WHERE THE 2 RWYS MEET. IF A PLT IN THIS SIT WOULD HAVE NOT HEARD THE OTHER ACFT'S CLRNC FOR TKOF; AND THEN LOWERED HIS/HER L WING FOR A XWIND LNDG; THIS SIT COULD HAVE DEVELOPED INTO THE NEEDLESS DEATHS OF SEVERAL PEOPLE. AFTER LNDG I WENT TO THE TWR TO FILE A FORMAL COMPLAINT. I WAS TOLD THAT THEY WERE TRAINING ATC PERSONNEL HERE. THE COMMUTER ACFT WAS DEPARTING ON AN IFR FLT TO ORD. I WAS TOLD THAT THIS ACFT HAD TO LEAVE WITHIN A 2 MIN TIME FRAME IN ORDER TO BE CLRED INTO ORD ON THEIR TIME SLOT OR WAIT ON THE GND AT LEAST AN ADDITIONAL 1/2 HR. ALSO; THE PLTS OF THE DEPARTING ACFT DID NOT SEEM TO BE AWARE OF MY POS IN THE TFC PATTERN. THERE ARE PLTS WHO DON'T QUESTION THE ABILITIES OF ATC PERSONNEL. THIS IS A VERY TAXING SIT TO ASK A PVT PLT WITH 160 HRS TO EXECUTE A GAR WHEN HE HAS A COMMUTER ACFT SCREAMING AT HIM! I FEEL THAT ATC HAD A MORAL OBLIGATION TO GIVE ME A GAR FIRST; THEN INSURE THAT I WAS CLR OF THE INTXN; BEFORE GIVING THE OTHER ACFT CLRNC TO TKOF.

THE 2 ACFT WERE CLRED FOR LNDG BY TWR TO THE SAME RWY: AND THEIR RESULTING FLT PATHS RESULTED IN A TFC CONFLICT AND A NEAR MISS. THIS DESCRIPTION IS OFFERED BY THE INSTRUCTOR OF THE STUDENT PLT; WHO WAS OBSERVING THE CHAIN OF EVENTS FROM THE GND AND WHO WAS LISTENING TO ATC COMS ON A HAND HELD RADIO. THE STUDENT PLT IS PART OF A FOREIGN STUDENT GROUP CONDUCTING PRIMARY FLT TRAINING AT THE ARPT WHERE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. THE STUDENT HAD RECEIVED APPROX 26 HRS OF DUAL INSTRUCTION IN THE PRECEDING 17 DAYS AND HAD PERFORMED HIS FIRST SOLO THE DAY BEFORE. THE STUDENT WAS CONDUCTING HIS SECOND SUPERVISED SOLO AT THE TIME OF THE OCCURRENCE. FOLLOWING THE STUDENT'S CALL TO TWR RPTING L DOWNWIND; THE TWR CLRED THE STUDENT FOR THE OPTION AND TO FOLLOW ANOTHER ACFT AHEAD ON L DOWNWIND AND A JETSTREAM MAKING R TFC FOR THE SAME RWY. THE STUDENT RESPONDED WITH THE ACFT'S 'N' NUMBER. THE TWR MADE ADDITIONAL CALLS TO THE STUDENT IN AN EFFORT TO LEARN IF HE HAD THE JETSTREAM TFC IN VIEW. THE STUDENT DID NOT RESPOND TO TWR'S QUERY TO CONFIRM THAT HE DID OR DID NOT HAVE THE TFC IN SIGHT. THE STUDENT TURNED L BASE AS THE JETSTREAM WAS TURNING R BASE FOR THE SAME RWY. THE 2 ACFT WERE ON CONVERGING FLT PATHS TO THE POINT WHERE BOTH WERE ABOUT TO TURN FINAL WHEN TWR CALLED FOR THE STUDENT TO EXECUTE A GAR. AT THE SAME TIME THE JETSTREAM MADE A TIGHT TURN TO THE R IN WHAT LOOKED LIKE AN EVASIVE MANEUVER TO AVOID THE STUDENT'S ACFT. BOTH ACFT MADE GARS AND THEN LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT. I INTERVIEWED THE STUDENT PLT FOLLOWING HIS LNDG. THE STUDENT SOMBERLY APOLOGIZED FOR BEING A PART OF THE TFC CONFLICT. I CAME AWAY WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THE TFC ALERT FROM TWR; BUT COULD NOT THINK QUICKLY ENOUGH TO FORMULATE A RADIO RESPONSE (ATC COMS FROM TWR WERE RAPID FIRE JUST PRIOR TO; DURING AND IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE TFC CONFLICT). THE STUDENT WAS LOOKING FOR THE JETSTREAM; BUT DID NOT SPOT THE ACFT UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE JETSTREAM SHOWED THE UNDERSIDE OF IT'S WINGS DURING IT'S EVASIVE MANEUVERING. FOLLOWING MY INTERVIEW WITH THE STUDENT I VISITED THE TWR TO DISCUSS THE SIT. THE CTLR VOICED HER OPINION THAT THE STUDENT DID NOT UNDERSTAND ENGLISH AND WAS (THEREFORE) A MENACE TO FLYING SAFETY. THE CTLR ASSERTED THAT THIS STUDENT FAILED TO POSITIVELY ACKNOWLEDGE CALLS PERTAINING TO TFC. THE CTLR SUGGESTED THAT ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTION WAS IN ORDER REGARDING ATC COMS IN GENERAL: AND MORE SPECIFICALLY; ACKNOWLEDGING ATC TFC ALERTS. I REPLIED THAT I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA AND AGREED TO WORK WITH THE STUDENT IN THIS REGARD AND WOULD PASS THE WORD ON TO THE OTHER INSTRUCTORS AT THE FLT SCHOOL AS WELL. WHILE THIS STUDENT PLT IS NO ENGLISH MAJOR; IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE STUDENT DID DEMONSTRATE A FAMILIARITY AND COMMAND OF ATC COMS DURING THE COURSE OF THIS FLT. THE STUDENT REQUESTED AND RECEIVED CLRNC FROM GND TO TAXI TO THE ACTIVE RWY. THE STUDENT REQUESTED TKOF CLRNC FROM TWR WHICH INCLUDED A REQUEST FOR L TFC TOUCH-AND-GOES. THE STUDENT RECEIVED; ACKNOWLEDGED AND PERFORMED A CLRNC TO 'TAXI INTO POS AND HOLD.' THE STUDENT ACKNOWLEDGED AND PERFORMED THE CLRNC TO TAKE OFF AND TO MAKE L TFC AND RPT DOWNWIND. THE STUDENT UNDERSTOOD AND TOOK APPROPRIATE ACTION FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTION TO 'GAR' DURING THE INCIDENT: AND ON THE FOLLOWING PATTERN ACKNOWLEDGED AND FOLLOWED AN INSTRUCTION TO 'EXTEND YOUR DOWNWIND; I (TWR) WILL CALL YOUR BASE.' THE STUDENT EXTENDED HIS DOWNWIND UNTIL INSTRUCTED TO TURN BASE AT WHICH POINT HE DID SO. ON HIS FINAL PATTERN THE STUDENT RPTED A L DOWNWIND AND REQUESTED A FULL STOP LNDG. WHILE THE STUDENT'S FAILURE TO ANSWER TWR'S TFC ALERTS WITH A CLR RESPONSE IS CAUSE FOR CONCERN; IN MY OPINION TWR SHARES RESPONSIBILITY IN ALLOWING THE SIT TO DEVELOP TO THE EXTENT THAT IT BECAME A CONFLICT. THE CTLR STATED THAT SHE WAS UNABLE TO ASCERTAIN IF THE STUDENT HAD SPOTTED THE TFC AS THE 2 ACFT WERE BEGINNING TO TURN ONTO THEIR RESPECTIVE BASE LEGS. THE CTLR WASCLRLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR A TFC CONFLICT: BUT INSTEAD OF INSTRUCTING THE JETSTREAM OR THE STUDENT TO MAKE TURNS TO EVADE ONE ANOTHER; THE CTLR WAS PREOCCUPIED WITH MAKING REPEATED QUERIES TO THE STUDENT TO LEARN IF HE HAD THE JETSTREAM TFC IN SIGHT AS THE 2 ACFT CONTINUED TO CONVERGE ON ONE ANOTHER. ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTION WILL BE GIVEN TO THE STUDENT REGARDING ATC COMS BEFORE HE IS ALLOWED TO CONDUCT FUTURE SOLO OPS: AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THE CTLR WILL ALLOW ADDITIONAL SEPARATION BTWN STUDENT PLTS AND COMMUTER ACFT AND WILL TAKE PROACTIVE MEASURES WHEN SHE IS UNSURE OF A GIVEN TFC SIT.",,,,"SMA AND LTT IN TFC PATTERN HAVE CLOSE PROX.",

IT IS A COMMON ROUTINE FOR ALL TFC WATCH PLTS TO BE RPTING POSITIONS ON A JOINT FREQ UNLESS OPERATING IN AIRSPACE WHERE AIR TFC CTL COM IS REQUIRED. I HAD JUST RPTED MY POS ON THIS FREQ; WHEN I NOTICED A HELI COMING MY DIRECTION AND AT MY ALT; AT MY 1-2 O'CLOCK POS. I ESTIMATE THE DISTANCE TO HAVE BEEN 1-1 1/2 MI. MS. A POINTED OUT THE TFC SIMULTANEOUSLY. BECAUSE OF MY POS RELATIVE TO THE HELI; I IMMEDIATELY STARTED A L TURN; WHILE THE HELI; WHOSE PLT APPARENTLY HAD YET NOT SEEN ME; PROCEEDED WITH NO CHANGE IN COURSE.

THIS IS ALSO THE FREQ MOST COMMONLY USED BY HELI PLTS; EVEN WHEN NOT OPERATING DIRECTLY OVER THE HUDSON RIVER. ONCE ON THE NEW FREQ; I RPTED MY POS AGAIN; AND ADVISED I WOULD BE XING THE RIVER ON A WESTERLY COURSE. THE HELI PLT THEN FURIOUSLY STATED THAT I HAD ALMOST CAUSED A MID AIR COLLISION.

I BELIEVE THE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THIS SIT PRIMARILY ARE AS FOLLOWS: THE HIGH DENSITY OF VFR TFC OPERATING IN THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA; THE FACT THAT HELI PLTS; FULLY AWARE OF THE RADIO PROCS CONDUCTED BY FIXED WING TFC RPTR PLTS AS WELL AS THEIR FREQUENCIES; ARE FAILING TO CHANGE FREQS ONCE OUTSIDE THE HUDSON RIVER CORRIDOR.",,,,"TFC WATCH ACFT HAS NMAC WITH HELI ALONG HUDSON RIVER CORRIDOR.",

UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION IT WAS DETERMINED THAT WINDS BTWN NORFOLK AND WILMINGTON WERE ACTUALLY 15-17 KTS ALONG THE RTE OF FLT. PERFORMANCE: THE AGE OF THE ACFT AND THE LACK OF AN EGT SO AS TO PROVIDE ACCURATE LEANING; WERE FACTORS FOUND TO AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE.

SHE WAS VERY HELPFUL IN ASSISTING ME BY MAKING THE CALLS NECESSARY TO RPT AND REPAIR THE WIRE.

ALTHOUGH I FOLLOWED THE CHKLIST FOR THE C-150; APPLICATION OF CARB HEAT AT THE START OF MY DSCNT MAY HAVE PREVENTED SUDDEN PWR LOSS. THE CHKLIST SAID TO TURN ON CARB HEAT PRIOR TO 'CLOSING THE THROTTLE.' IT SHOULD READ; PRIOR TO 'REDUCING THROTTLE' FOR DSCNT. ON NOV/XX/94; I WAS ON A VFR FLT FROM BIRMINGHAM; AL; TO ENTERPRISE; AL; WITH A PLANNED REFUELING STOP AT TROY; AL; AT APPROX XA00 HRS AND 10 MI N OF TROY ARPT; I CONTACTED TROY TWR FOR LNDG INSTRUCTIONS. TROY TWR TOLD ME TO ESTABLISH A L BASE FOR RWY 07. I BEGAN MY DSCNT BY REDUCING PWR FROM 2500 RPM TO 2200 RPM (RPM REMAINED IN THE GREEN ARC) AND INCREASED MY AIRSPD BY REDUCING PITCH TO 115 MPH (STILL IN THE GREEN ON AIRSPD). AS I BEGAN TO LEVEL OFF FOR TFC PATTERN ALT (1900 FT MSL); THE ENG SUDDENLY 'COUGHED' AND SHOOK. I NOTICED A DROP IN RPM SO I APPLIED CARB HEAT. THE ENG SEEMED TO RUN ROUGHER SO I CLOSED THE CARB HEAT AND TURNED TO THE L AND HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THE ARPT END LINED UP WITH RWY 14. I CALLED THE TWR AND DECLARED AN EMER AND TOLD THEM THAT I WAS LOSING ENG PWR. I SAID THAT I WANTED TO LAND ON RWY 14. THE TWR AGAIN TOLD ME TO LAND ON RWY 7. I DID NOT WANT TO CONTINUE TO RWY 7 SINCE IT WAS SEVERAL MI AWAY. I EXPECTED THE TWR TO TELL ALL OTHER ACFT; INCLUDING THE ONE LNDG ON RWY 07; TO STAY CLR SO THAT I COULD LAND ON RWY 14. AT THIS POINT; I WAS FACED WITH 2 MAJOR CONCERNS: 1) IF I CONTINUED TO RWY 14; WOULD I CAUSE AN ACCIDENT WITH ACFT LNDG AND TAKING OFF OF THE ACTIVE RWY 07? 2) IF THE ENG CONTINUED TO LOSE PWR; WOULD I CRASH INTO THE DENSE FOREST BTWN ME AND RWY 14? THE ONLY SUITABLE LNDG AREA BTWN ME AND RWY 14 WAS A LARGE OPEN FIELD. I DECIDED TO LAND IN THE FIELD WHILE I HAD ENG PWR AND ENSURE THAT I WOULD NOT CAUSE AN ACCIDENT WITH LNDG OR DEPARTING TFC. I INFORMED TWR THAT I WAS LNDG APPROX 2 MI NW OF RWY 14 IN AN OPEN FIELD. ONCE LNDG WAS ASSURED; I CLOSED THE THROTTLE; TURNED OFF THE MAGNETOS; MADE ONE LAST CALL; AND TURNED OFF THE MASTER SWITCH (MAGNETOS AND MASTER SWITCH WERE TURNED OFF AS PRECAUTION AGAINST POST CRASH FIRE). I MADE AN EXCELLENT LNDG TO LEVEL GND AND STOPPED WITH NO INJURY OR DAMAGE TO THE PLANE. I TURNED PWR BACK ON AND INFORMED TWR THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK. THEY DISPATCHED POLICE AND FIRE UNITS TO THE SCENE. I MADE A FULL POLICE RPT AND BOTH POLICE AND FIRE UNITS LEFT AS SOON AS THEY SAW THAT THERE WAS NO DAMAGE OR INJURY. I CALLED THE OWNER AND TOLD HIM WHAT HAPPENED. HE ARRIVED AT DUSK AND DETERMINED THAT I HAD BTWN 30-40 MIN OF FUEL REMAINING IN THE TANKS. HE SUSPECTED CARB ICE.

THEREFORE; I DECIDED TO GO DIRECT TO ORMOND INSTEAD OF CONTINUING THE SECOND LEG TO MELBOURNE. TO SAVE TIME I ALSO INCREASED THE PWR SETTING TO 2500 RPM (95 KTS) SO I WAS SURE TO ARRIVE AT OMN BEFORE DARK. WHEN WE WERE ABOUT 15 NM N OF TIX; I NOTICED THE FUEL GAUGES TO BELOW. BUT AS I WAS TAUGHT NOT TO RELY ON THESE GAUGES I STARTED TO CALCULATE THE ENDURANCE: THE HOBBS-METER READ PLUS/MINUS 3.1 HRS AND WITH A SIMPLE MULTIPLICATION I FIGURED I HAD BURNED 5 GALLONS PER HR TIMES 3.1 HRS EQUALS 15.5 GALLONS OF FUEL. WITH 22.5 GALLONS OF USABLE FUEL ABOARD I THOUGHT THAT I COULD FLY FOR ANOTHER 1.4 HRS (22.5 MINUS 15.5 DIVIDED BY 5 GALLONS PER HR). WHEN WE PASSED NEW SMYRNA BEACH (34J) ARPT I CONSIDERED LNDG THERE BECAUSE DAYTONA APCH TOLD ME THAT THE CEILING IN ORMOND WAS 800 FT AND THE SUN JUST DISAPPEARED. PLUS; THAT THE FUEL GAUGES WERE NOW GETTING VERY LOW; BUT I STILL DECIDED TO GO ON BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING REASONS: I JUST CALCULATED 1.4 HRS LEFT TO FLY. DME WAS SHOWING ONLY 10 MINS TO THE STATION (OMN VORTAC). I FIGURED THAT THE FLYING SCHOOL TO WHICH THE AIRPLANE BELONGED WOULDN'T LIKE A TELEPHONE CALL FROM ME BEING STRANDED IN NEW SMYRNA BEACH. I THOUGHT THAT MY FRIENDS WHO WOULD PICK US UP FROM ORMOND WOULDN'T' LIKE ME TO BE IN NEW SMYRNA EITHER. THE CTAF/UNICOM FREQ OF 122.7 OMN I ASKED FOR TA AND THE RWY IN USE WAS RWY 35. THAT RWY WAS ALMOST RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME SO I REACHED THE PUSH-TO- TALK BUTTON ANNOUNCE LONG FINAL FOR RWY 35. AT THAT MOMENT THE ENG STOPPED (I WAS IN A L TURN) AND IMMEDIATELY I KNEW THAT I WAS OUT OF FUEL. I MADE THE MAYDAY CALL ON 122.70 MHZ AS WELL AS 121.5 MHZ. BUT; BECAUSE I WAS ONLY 800 FT HIGH WE DIDN'T MAKE IT TO THAT FILED AND CRASH-LANDED IN THE WOODS RIGHT BEFORE THE OPEN SPOT. THE AIRPLANE WAS DECLARED 'TOTAL LOSS.' UP UNTIL THAT MOMENT WE ARRIVED AT ORM; I STILL DIDN'T KNOW WHY THERE WAS NO MORE FUEL LEFT BECAUSE I CALCULATED A HAD OVER AN HR LEFT AFTER THE CRASH. BUT; WHEN SOMEONE AT OMN ASKED ME WHAT PWR SETTING I HAD USED; IT GOT TO ME THAT I HAD MADE A MAJOR MISTAKE WITH THE ENDURANCE CALCULATION. I USED 5 GALLONS PER HR; WHICH IS ONLY FOR CRUISE PWR SETTING (2300 RPM) WHILE DURING MOST OF THE FLT I HAD USED 2400 AND 2500 RPM; WHICH USES ALMOST 7 GALLONS PER HR (7 TIMES 3.3 EQUALS 23.1 GALLONS WHICH IS GREATER THAN 22.5 USABLE GALLONS). I KNOW NOW THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE I SHOULD HAVE NEVER MADE; BUT AT THE TIME IT HAPPENED; I THOUGHT I WAS DOING EVERYTHING AS I SHOULD. THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS IN THIS CASE WOULD HAVE BEEN: USING THE RECOMMENDED CRUISE PWR SETTING OF 2300 RPM (86 KTS).

I TOOK CTL OF THE ACFT FROM THE STUDENT AND PROCEEDED TO FLY TOWARD A LNDG SITE. HAVING COME TO THE REALIZATION WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE IT BACK TO STINSON (AS THERE WAS INADEQUATE PWR TO MAINTAIN ALT); I DECIDED TO MAKE A FORCED LNDG IN A FIELD APPROX 15 NM SE OF SAN ANTONIO.

AFTER SECURING THE ACFT ON THE GND AND ANSWERING THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL'S QUESTIONS; WE WERE TOLD TO WAIT AT THE SITE UNTIL THE ARR OF THE FAA INSPECTOR. ONCE THE INSPECTOR FROM THE SAN ANTONIO FSDO ARRIVED; IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE CAUSE OF PWR LOSS WAS MECHANICAL. UPON THE INSPECTOR'S REQUEST; I PRODUCED THE LOGBOOKS OF THE ACFT WHICH HE PROCEEDED TO CHK. THE INSPECTOR INFORMED ME THAT; IN THE ACFT AIRFRAME LOGBOOK; AND AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVE HAD NOT BEEN UPDATED. THE AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVE IN QUESTION WAS REGARDING SIDERAILS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ENG OR THE FORCED LNDG. WHEN I EXPRESSED UNFAMILIARITY WITH THIS AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVE; THE INSPECTOR WENT INTO LENGTH ABOUT THE DISCREPANCY AND THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING 'A WARNING' IN MY AIRMAN RECORD. AS FAR AS I AM AWARE; IT IS THE MECH'S RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE AN ENTRY INTO THE ACFT'S LOGBOOKS AND NOT MINE.

IT HAS SEAT BELTS AND SHOULDER HARNESSES; IS A FIXED GEAR; FIXED PITCH PROP AIRPLANE WITH; I BELIEVE; AN O-200 ENG. FUEL CONSUMPTION IS 5 GALLONS AN HR AT HIGH THROTTLE. CHAIN OF EVENTS: HOW THE PROB AROSE: AFTER BEING CLRED TO LAND AT ORL ON RWY 07 AND DURING OR AFTER THE TURN TO FINAL THERE WAS A LOSS OF PWR. MY RECOLLECTION IS THAT THE RPM WENT FROM 2300 TO 1700. AT THAT TIME I WAS AT APPROX 1000 FT MSL; EITHER ABOUT TO BE OR ALREADY LINED UP WITH RWY 07 AND 2 TO MI FROM THE ARPT. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: LACK OF TABS INSIDE THE TANKS OF THE 150. SIPHONING OF FUEL OUT OF TANKS BECAUSE OF WORN SEALS OR NOT FULLY LOCKED GAS CAPS. GASCOLATOR DRAIN NOT SEATING PROPERLY AND CAUSING LEAKAGE OF FUEL IN FLT. HOW IT WAS DISCOVERED: WHEN THE ENG RPM WENT TO 1700 AND DID NOT GO TO HIGH RPM EVEN AFTER APPLICATION OF FULL THROTTLE; I DETERMINED THAT THE ENG WAS EXPERIENCING A PWR LOSS. AT THAT TIME I DID NOT KNOW THE REASON FOR THIS PWR LOSS. AT LEAST ONE OF THE FUEL GAUGES WAS INDICATING OVER 1/4 TANK (SHOULD BE APPROX 3 GALLONS). IN MY OPINION THE ACFT'S ENG WAS EXPERIENCING A PARTIAL PWR LOSS. IT DID NOT RESPOND TO FULL THROTTLE. I CALLED THE TWR AND ADVISED IT I HAD A PWR LOSS AND REQUIRED IMMEDIATE RWY (I DID NOT WANT TO HAVE ANOTHER AIRPLANE CLRED TO LAND BEFORE ME AND BE FORCED INTO A GAR SIT). THE RATE OF DSCNT WAS TOO HIGH AND THE ALT WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO REACH THE ARPT. I DECIDED TO ATTEMPT A LNDG ON THE E-W EXPRESSWAY. I CALLED THE TWR AND TOLD THEM THAT I WAS GOING DOWN ON THE E-W. ONCE THE DECISION WAS MADE; MY ATTN FOCUSED ON LNDG. I SAW THAT THERE WAS AN OPENING BTWN 2 GROUPS OF CARS. I USED THE PWR OF THE ENG AND THE ANGLE OF DSCNT TO MATCH THE GAP WITH THE ACFT. I FLEW OVER ONE SET OF OVERHEAD SIGNS AND BROUGHT THE AIRPLANE DOWN IN THE GAP. I WAS AFRAID THAT THE CARS BEHIND MIGHT RUN INTO THE AIRPLANE IF I SLOWED DOWN. THERE WAS NO ROOM TO TAXI OFF THE ROAD. I APPLIED PWR. THE ENG RESPONDED WITH NO PROB. I KEPT THE NOSEWHEEL OFF THE GND AND CONTINUED IN A HIGH SPD TAXI DOWN THE EXPRESSWAY UNTIL I COULD FIND A RAMP TO TAXI ONTO AND STOP. THE FIRST RAMP WAS SUMMERLIN. A CAR WAS COMING UP THE RAMP. IT WAS TO MY R. IT WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO TAXI IN FRONT OF IT; IT WOULD NOT MOVE OFF MY R WINGTIP AND KEPT BLOWING ITS KLAXON. THE RAMP WAS NOW BEHIND ME. I CONTINUED IN MY HIGH SPD TAXI. NOW THE CARS WERE BEGINNING TO PASS ON MY L AND BLOWING THEIR KLAXONS AS THEY PASSED THE AIRPLANE AND; BELIEVE IT OR NOT; WAVING AT ME. I GOT REAL CONCERNED WHEN SOME OF THE CARS GOT VERY CLOSE TO THE L WINGTIP. I MOVED MORE TO THE R. IT WAS THEN THAT THE R PLASTIC WINGTIP FARING HIT A STREET LIGHT. I MOVED THE AIRPLANE BACK TO THE L. I CONTINUED ON HIGH SPD TAXI UNTIL THE MILLS ON-RAMP. NOBODY WAS COMING UP THE RAMP. I CUT THE PWR; APPLIED BRAKES AND SLOWED TO A HALT ON THE SIDE OF THE RAMP. I PULLED THE MIXTURE CTL KILLING THE ENG. I TURNED OFF THE MAGNETOS; THE MASTER SWITCH AND SHUT OFF THE FUEL SUPPLY. I THEN EXITED THE ACFT AND INSPECTED IT FOR ANY DAMAGE. OTHER THAN THE R WINGTIP THERE WAS NO OTHER DAMAGE. AFTER THE POLICE ARRIVED AND AT THEIR REQUEST; I MOVED THE AIRPLANE FURTHER INTO THE RAMP AND CHOCKED THE WHEELS TO PREVENT A ROLLBACK. THE TANKS ON THE 150 SHOULD ALL BE RETROFITTED WITH TABS TO SHOW 1/2 AND 1/4 FUEL LEVELS. THE GAUGES; AS IS EVIDENT FROM MY CASE; ARE HIGHLY INACCURATE (SHOWING 1/4 FULL). A TRAINER SHOULD HAVE A VISUAL METHOD TO GAUGE FUEL QUANTITY. A STUDENT MIGHT NOT THINK OF THE WOOD DOWEL METHOD. THE GASCOLATOR DRAIN SHOULD; WHEN RELEASED; AUTOMATICALLY GO TO THE CLOSED POS. IF THE LEVER IS NOT SHOVED BACK IN; THE DRAIN REMAINS PARTIALLY OPEN AND FUEL LEAKS. LOW FUEL APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF THE INITIAL PWR LOSS. WHEN THE BANKING MANEUVER WAS EXECUTED AIR COULD HAVE GOTTEN INTO THE LINE AND THAT CAUSED THE PWR LOSS. ONCE THE AIRPLANE WAS ON THE GND; I WAS ABLE TO USE HIGH THROTTLE TO MAINTAIN A HIGH SPD TAXI FOR A DISTANCE OF 3/4 TO 1MI ON THE E-W. WHEN THE AIRPLANE CAME TO A STOP; THE ENG WAS RUNNING AND WAS STOPPED BY PULLING THE MIXTURE. ACCORDING TO MY VISUAL INSPECTION AND THE GAUGES; WHEN I LEFT ORL; I HAD AROUND 12 GALLONS (ONE SLIGHTLY OVER AND ONE AT 1/2 OF THE TOTAL FUEL LOAD). MY FLT TO LEEWARD WAS 35 MINS OR A CONSUMPTION OF 3.5 GALLONS. THAT AGREES WITH THE GAUGES AT LEEWARD. THEY READ 1/4 AND 1/2 OR APPROX 9 GALLONS. MY RETURN FLT WAS FLT PLANNED FOR 45 MINS TO ALLOW FOR A HEADWIND. AT A RATE OF CONSUMPTION OF 5 GALLONS AN HR AND ONE TO CLB TO 1000 FT I HAD ENOUGH FUEL FOR 1.3 TO 1.5 HRS. I HAD BEEN IN THE AIR FOR APPROX 40 MINS WHEN THE AIRPLANE SUFFERED THE PWR LOSS. FROM ALL THE ABOVE FACTS; I MUST CONCLUDE THAT FUEL WAS LOST DURING THE FLT OR THAT THE GAUGES OR MY VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE FUEL IN THE TANKS WAS HIGHLY INACCURATE. I HAVE BEEN FLYING FOR A LONG TIME AND IN MY OPINION I WOULD NOT MISJUDGE FUEL (SPECIALLY SINCE I USE A WOOD DOWEL TO ASSESS TANK LEVEL). THEREFORE; I BELIEVE THAT INFLT LOSS WAS THE CAUSE OF THE LOW FUEL.",,,,"FUEL EXHAUSTION -- OFF ARPT LNDG.",

JUST BEFORE RADAR SVC WAS TERMINATED WITH ALB; DEP ADVISED ME THAT MY XPONDER WAS INTERMITTENT. I NOTICED A SLIGHT DISCHARGE ON THE AMMETER (APPROX 1 NEEDLE WIDTH). AT THAT POINT I STARTED DECREASING MY ELECTRICAL LOAD; BY TURNING OFF LIGHTS AND XPONDER WITH ONLY TURNING THE RADIO ON BRIEFLY FOR VOR NAV CHK. I ALSO TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO RECYCLE THE ALTERNATOR BY TURNING OFF THE MASTER SWITCH. THE ALTERNATOR NEVER CAME BACK ON- LINE. MY PLAN WAS TO CONSERVE MY BATTERY WITH HOPES OF HAVING ENOUGH PWR LEFT TO COMMUNICATE WITH ROC APCH. MY ALTERNATE PLAN WAS TO LAND AT 6G3 BECAUSE THEIR RWY LIGHTS WORK ON A GND BASE TIMER AND SHUT OFF AT MIDNIGHT. AT XY40; 20 NM ESE FROM ROC; I COLLECTED ATIS AND TRIED CALLING ROC APCH ON 119.55. THE RADIO WOULD NOT XMIT AND IT MADE A TONE SIMILAR TO A FEEDBACK SOUND WHENEVER I KEYED THE MIKE. I THEN DIVERTED TO 6G3 ARRIVING AT XY45. THE RWY LIGHTS WERE ALREADY OFF. I HAD A CELLULAR PHONE WITH ME IN THE PLANE THAT I BROUGHT IN CASE OF SUCH AN EMER. AFTER A FAILED ATTEMPT OF CALLING THE TWR DIRECTLY; THE OPERATOR TRANSFERRED ME TO 911. THEY CALLED ARPT FIRE AND RESCUE AND THEY RELAYED MY REQUEST TO THE TWR FOR A LIGHT GUN CLRNC. THE CELLULAR PHONE BATTERY DIED BEFORE I GOT A CLRNC OVER THE PHONE. AT THAT POINT I LEFT MY HOLDING PATTERN OVER 6G3; NY; AND ATTEMPTED TO FIND 3G7 ARPT WITH THE HOPES OF MAYBE HAVING THE RWY LIGHTS LEFT ON THERE. WHILE ENRTE TO 3G7 I CHKED MY FUEL GAUGES. 10 MINS EARLIER THEY READ 1/2 FULL (BOTH L AND R) NOW THE L TANK READ EMPTY AND THE R JUST BELOW 1/4 FULL. MY THOUGHTS WERE THE LOW INDICATIONS WERE DUE TO THE LACK OF ELECTRICAL PWR; BUT I COULD NOT BE TOTALLY SURE. I DECIDED TO FLY BACK TOWARDS 6G3 AND THEN TO ROC. OVER 6G3 I HAD ENOUGH BATTERY PWR TO MAKE 1 CALL TO 911 AND TOLD THEM TO ADVISE ROC TWR THAT I WAS APCHING TO LAND. AS SOON AS I GOT MY MESSAGE THROUGH THE PHONE BATTERY DIED AGAIN. ON APCHING ROC; I SAW THE RWY LIGHTS FOR RWY 28 WERE TURNED UP AND THE FIRE TRUCKS WERE PARKED ALONG IT. I RECEIVED A STEADY GREEN LIGHT FROM TWR TO LAND AND I PROCEEDED TO MAKE A SAFE LNDG ON RWY 28 AT APPROX AM30. AFTER LNDG I RECEIVED A FLASHING GREEN LIGHT TO TAXI.

PART OF THIS TRAINING INVOLVES REDUCING PWR AND SETTING UP FOR AN EMER LNDG. ON THE DAY OF THIS INCIDENT THE C-150 WE WERE USING HAD BEEN FLOWN OVER 4 HRS WITH NO PROBS. ON THE LAST FLT OF THE DAY I HAD A STUDENT WHO IS PREPARING FOR HIS PVT PLT CHK RIDE. WE STARTED THE TRAINING SESSION WITH TURNS AROUND A POINT.

THE FOLLOWING DAY I TRIED TO CONTACT THE LCL FAA SAFETY DIRECTOR LOCATED AT THE PORT COLUMBUS ARPT. IT WASN'T UNTIL APR/TUE/95 THAT I SPOKE WITH HIM ABOUT THE INCIDENT.

HE THOUGHT HE WOULD REMAIN OUTSIDE OF THE 5 MI ARSA AND HE SIMPLY NAVED ERRONEOUSLY. HE HAS NOT HEARD FROM THE FAA REGARDING ANY SANCTIONS AGAINST HIM SO FAR.

AT ROCKFORD THE CEILING WAS RPTED TO BE 1200-1500 FT WITH 5 MI VISIBILITY. THESE FACTORS LED ME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT BEYOND THE DECATUR AREA THE WX WAS IMPROVING. ACCORDINGLY; I DECIDED TO CONTINUE ON IN VFR CONDITIONS AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AND ATTEMPTED TO FLY AROUND ANY AREAS OF LOCALIZED IFR CONDITIONS IF THINGS DID NOT IMPROVE. WHEN I ARRIVED IN THE DECATUR AREA; CEILINGS WERE APPROX 1000 FT AGL; VISIBILITY SEEMED OKAY AND I PUSHED ON UNDER THE OVCST. THE CEILING MOVED DOWN FURTHER AS I PROCEEDED TO THE N.

IN THE FUTURE; I INTEND TO RESTRICT MY SOFT-FIELD PRACTICE TO PUBLIC SOFT FIELDS (LIKE THE TURF STRIP AT DUTCHESS COUNTY ARPT-POU; OR PERHAPS SHELBURNE; WHICH IS WELL MAINTAINED AND WIDELY USED). A MORE IMPORTANT LESSON IS THAT; ALTHOUGH I FELT I FOLLOWED PROCS PROPERLY; AND SURVEYED THE FIELD ADEQUATELY; AND HAD ALL THE INDICATORS TO SHOW THE FIELD WAS IN ACTIVE USE (A PLANE NEARBY; A CROWD OF PEOPLE; A WINDSOCK); AND DESPITE THE FACT THE FIELD LOOKED GOOD FROM 2 PASSES ALONG ITS ENTIRE LENGTH -- NONE OF THIS GOOD INFO COULD MAKE THE FIELD SOLID ALONG ITS ENTIRE LENGTH.",,,,"RWY CONDITION SURFACE ROUGHNESS -- PLT LANDS ON A PVT ARPT WITH SOD RWY AND WHILE TAXING ALONG THE RWY HIS NOSE GEAR GOES INTO A HOLE AND THE ACFT IS DAMAGED.",

I AGREED TO RENT THE AIRPLANE; AND ACT AS PIC FOR THE FLT. WE MET 1 HR BEFORE THE FLT TO BRIEF THE FLT; AND PREFLT THE ACFT. WE HAD DECIDED AT THE BRIEF THAT WE WOULD MAKE OUR LOW PASSES HEADING FROM N TO S AND POS THE ACFT TO THE W OF THE CROWD. THIS WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY A 270 DEG TURN TO THE R TO HEAD E WITH R-HAND RACETRACKS FOR THE SOUVENIR DROPS. I MADE OUR FIRST PASS OF THE FIELD HEADING S; AT AN ALT OF APPROX 25 FT; AIRSPD 105 MPH. THESE PASSES ENDED IN A PULL-UP TO APPROX 150 FT; AND A REDUCTION IN AIRSPD TO 85-90 MPH. AT THIS POINT; THE R SIDE WINDOW WAS OPENED TO DROP THE SOUVENIRS; AND 4 OR 5 PASSES WERE MADE OF THE FIELD ON A W TO E HDG AT APPROX 50 FT TO 80 FT (TREE TOPS). AT THE COMPLETION OF THE DROPS; I MADE 1 FINAL PASS AT APPROX 15 FT ON A HDG OF S WITH A PULL-UP AND AILERON ROCKING OF THE WINGS.

I LEFT MY HOME BASE (2N8) AND WAS HDG TO TTN FOR 3 PRACTICE TKOFS AND LNDGS; AT A CTLED FIELD. I WAS FOLLOWING A HDG OF 265 DEGS. WHEN I SAW THE DELAWARE RIVER AHEAD; I REALIZED I HAD MISSED TRENTON. I FELT THAT I WAS N OF MY DEST AND TURNED TO A HDG OF 180 DEGS. I SAW AN AIRPLANE LNDG; IN THE DISTANCE AND WAS RELIEVED TO HAVE FOUND TRENTON SO EASILY. I CALLED THE TWR WITH MY LOCATION AND INTENTIONS AND THEY INSTRUCTED ME TO CALL AT 'DOWNWIND RWY 06.' UPON TURNING DOWNWIND RWY 06; I CALLED TRENTON TWR; INFORMED THEM OF MY POSITION AND WAS 'CLRED TO LAND' ON RWY 06. THE LNDG WAS UNEVENTFUL UNTIL I DIALED IN THE FREQ FOR GND CTL. AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO RAISE GND CTL AND THE TWR; I REALIZED THAT MY RADIO WAS OUT. IN THE MEANTIME; I TAXIED OFF THE RWY AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE POINT; PARKED THE AIRPLANE AND TRIED TO GET THE RADIO BACK ON LINE. UNSUCCESSFUL AT GETTING THE RADIO WORKING; I DECIDED TO TRY TO FIND SOMEONE TO HELP. I TAXIED TOWARD A LARGE HANGAR IN THE DISTANCE. I WENT AS FAR AS I COULD WHEN I SAW A LARGE GREEN AIRPLANE PARKED IN FRONT OF THE HANGAR. AT THAT POINT I REALIZED THAT I HAD NOT LANDED AT TRENTON AT ALL; BUT AT WRI. I PARKED THE AIRPLANE; GOT OUT AND APCHED THE FIRST AVAILABLE PERSON. I EXPLAINED MY SIT AND INDICATED THAT I DID NEED TO COM WITH THE TWR SO THAT I COULD TKOF. WITHIN A FEW MINS; I WAS SURROUNDED BY MP'S ASKING ME QUESTIONS AND SEARCHING MY CESSNA 150 FOR CONTRABAND. UPON EXPLANATION OF MY ERROR; THE DIRECTOR OF BASE OPS ARRIVED. WITH HIS HELP; I SIGNED A STACK OF FORMS. AFTER WHICH; I TAXIED THE CESSNA; WITH AN ESCORT; TO FAR END OF THE FIELD. AS IT WAS APCHING NIGHTTIME AND I HAVE HAD NO NIGHT EXPERIENCE; I HAD TO WAIT FOR THE 2 INSTRUCTORS FROM MARLBORO TO COME DOWN AND RETRIEVE ME. I FLEW HOME WITH ONE OF THE INSTRUCTORS; STILL UNABLE TO GET THE RADIO WORKING. AT LEAST HE WAS PREPARED WITH A HAND-HELD. THE AMAZING THING WAS THAT I WAS 'CLRED TO LAND' ON RWY 06 AND LANDED ON RWY 06. IT WAS JUST THE WRONG ARPT! OBVIOUSLY TRENTON TWR NEVER SAW ME AND STILL GAVE ME CLRNC TO LAND. THE SECOND ISSUE WAS MY ABILITY TO LAND AT AN AIR FORCE BASE UNNOTICED. I WAS ON THE GND APPROX 1/2 HR TRYING TO GET THE RADIO WORKING BEFORE I TRIED TO FIND SOME HELP. NO ONE KNEW I WAS THERE UNTIL I MADE MY PRESENCE KNOWN. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: I BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING 2 POINTS TO HAVE BEEN CRITICAL TO HAVE PREVENTED THIS UNINTENDED LNDG: IF THE CTLR AT TRENTON DID NOT SEE ME; HE SHOULD HAVE INDICATED SO. FURTHER PURSUIT OF MY EXACT LOCATION WOULD HAVE PROVEN THAT I WAS NOT IN THEIR PATTERN. IF ARPTS HAD THEIR 'IDENTIFIER' PROMINENTLY PAINTED ON A BUILDING OR ROOF; THIS PROB COULD BE MORE EASILY BE AVOIDED. I UNDERSTAND THAT IN 1935; FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT ENACTED THE WORKS PROGRESS ADMINISTRATION. WITH THE BUILDING OF THOSE ARPTS; SOME STANDARDIZATION HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED REGARDING LIGHTING; ARPT MARKINGS; ETC. WE SHOULD GO BACK TO THE OLD WAYS. A COUPLE OF GALLONS OF WHITE PAINT AND BRUSH WOULD BE AN INEXPENSIVE WAY TO AVOID A SIT SUCH AS THIS FOR THE FUTURE. HUMAN PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS: IT IS TRUE; I MADE A HUGE BLUNDER. I THANK THE FOLKS AT MCGUIRE OPS FOR HAVING SUCH A GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR. AS A STUDENT; HOWEVER; I LEARNED SEVERAL VALUABLE LESSONS. THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSON OF ALL IS THE NECESSITY OF BEING TOTALLY PREPARED PRIOR TO ANY FLT. PREPARATION SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED COMPLETION OF A FLT PLAN EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS A SHORT XCOUNTRY. I SHOULD HAVE USED NAVAIDS WHEN I REALIZED THAT I WAS OFF COURSE. I DO NOT FEEL HOWEVER THAT MY INSTRUCTOR PREPARED ME PROPERLY. YOU CAN BE SURE THAT I WILL NOT WAIT FOR INSTRUCTIONS; IN THE FUTURE; BUT WILL PREPARE EVERYTHING COMPLETELY AND PRECISELY; MYSELF; PRIOR TO MY NEXT FLT.",,,,"STUDENT PLT LANDED WRONG ARPT; TWR DIDN'T KNOW.",

AFTER A SUCCESSFUL FULL PWR RUN-UP WAS CONDUCTED; TFC WAS BLOCKED TO ALLOW THE ACFT TO BE FLOWN OFF THE ROAD. UPON RETURN TO SHN THE ACFT WAS TOPPED OFF WITH 15.7 GALS OF 80/87. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 2-3 GALS OF FUEL WERE BURNED DURING THE ENG RUN-UP AND RETURN FLT TO THE ARPT. (15.7 PLUS 10.0 MINUS 2.5 EQUALS 23.7 GALS). THE POH OF THIS ACFT LISTS THE FUEL CAPACITY OF 26 GALS WITH ONLY 22.5 GALS BEING USABLE. THIS CFI HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO FALL INTO A TRAP. HE HAD DEVELOPED A BAD HABIT OF TRUSTING THE FUEL GAUGES OF THE ACFT THAT HE REGULARLY FLEW; ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY CONFIRMED HIS FUEL REMAINING CALCULATIONS. THE FACT THAT HE WAS NOT COMPLETELY FAMILIAR WITH THIS PARTICULAR ACFT DID NOT ALTER HIS PROC AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE SIPHONED FUEL FROM THE ACFT NEVER ENTERED HIS MIND. GOOD PREFLT PROC ALWAYS HAS; AND ALWAYS WILL; INCLUDE THE VISUAL CHKING OF THE FUEL LEVEL; BUT SOMETIMES WE DEVELOP SHORTCUTS WHICH SHORT CIRCUIT THE OLD PROVEN METHODS. THIS FLT INSTRUCTOR WILL NO LONGER FLY WITHOUT A VISUAL CHK OF THE FUEL AND YOU MAY REST ASSURED THAT NONE OF HIS STUDENTS WILL EITHER!! CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR STATED THAT HE LEARNED LATER AFTER REVIEWING THE MATTER THAT THERE WAS NOT THE FUEL ABOARD THAT HE HAD CALCULATED SINCE THE FLT HE BELIEVED TO BE THE PREVIOUS FLT WAS NOT. THE STUDENT HE THOUGHT USED THE ACFT FOR ONLY A SHORT TIME PRIOR TO HIS FLT HAD ACTUALLY USED ANOTHER ACFT. HIS ACFT HAD BEEN USED FOR A LONGER TIME AND THEREFORE; THE FUEL REMAINING WAS ONLY SUFFICIENT FOR THE TIME HE SUBSEQUENTLY FLEW THE ACFT. HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TELL HIS EXPERIENCE TO OTHER PLTS WHENEVER POSSIBLE SINCE IT HAD SUCH A PROFOUND IMPACT ON HIS FLT INSTRUCTOR CAREER. HE FURTHER STATED THAT THE FAA INSPECTOR ADVISED THAT SHE WAS SENDING HER RPT TO FAA LEGAL FOR ACTION AGAINST HIS PLT'S CERTIFICATE.",,,,"PLT OF AN SMA SEL MADE AN OFF ARPT FORCED LNDG AFTER THE ENG QUIT DUE TO RUNNING OUT OF FUEL.",

I EXPLAINED TO THE GENTLEMAN THAT WE WERE NOT MADE AWARE OF THE RESTR AIRSPACE BUT WOULD AVOID IT ON ANY FUTURE FLT THROUGH THAT AREA. I WAS THEN GIVEN A TELEPHONE NUMBER TO CALL AT THE AIR BASE; AND UPON CALLING I WAS INSTRUCTED IN A HARSH MANNER ONCE AGAIN OF THE AIRSPACE RESTR.

AFTER OUR CONVERSATION I CALLED THE DAYTON OHIO FLT SVC STATION FOR A BRIEFING AND WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE AIRSPACE RESTR IN ANY FORM OR MANNER.

JUST PAST ABEAM THE LNDG THRESHOLD; AFTER BEGINNING THE LNDG DSCNT I NOTICED A WHITE LOW WING ACFT APCHING RAPIDLY FROM THE R. INITIALLY I DIDN'T THINK THE OTHER ACFT WAS LNDG; BUT WAS JUST FLYING THROUGH THE AREA. HE APCHED ON A VERY EXTENDED L BASE FROM A HIGH ALT. WHEN THE OTHER PLANE PASSED DIRECTLY AHEAD OF ME; WE WERE AT ABOUT THE SAME ALT AND APPROX 500 FT APART. ONCE THE OTHER ACFT PASSED I TURNED L BASE BEHIND IT. I REALIZED HE WAS GOING TO LAND WHEN HE TURNED FINAL. I CONTINUED MY BASE LEG THROUGH THE EXTENDED FINAL CTRLINE THEN TURNED TO THE L TO REALIGN WITH THE FINAL APCH PATH AND LOWERED FLAPS TO 20 DEGS ON SHORT FINAL. I SAW THE OTHER ACFT PREPARING TO TURN OFF THE RWY AND I LOWERED THE FLAPS TO 40 DEGS AND CONTINUED MY LNDG. THE ENCOUNTER WITH THE OTHER ACFT AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS MY FIRST UNSUPERVISED SOLO MADE ME NERVOUS AND UPSET MY CONCENTRATION THROUGHOUT THE LNDG CAUSING ME NOT TO MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CTL OF THE ACFT UPON LNDG. WHEN THE MAIN GEAR TOUCHED THE RWY; THE ACFT WAS POINTED SOMEWHAT TO THE L. MY L MAIN GEAR WENT INTO THE GRASS AND AS I BEGAN TO APPLY R RUDDER I REALIZED THAT IF I TURNED THE ACFT TO THE R; I WAS GOING TO HIT A RWY LIGHT. I DECIDED TO ALLOW THE PLANE TO CONTINUE OFF THE RWY TO THE L TO AVOID THE LIGHT. ONCE I WAS TOTALLY OFF THE RWY; EACH ATTEMPT TO SLOW OR TURN THE ACFT TO THE R CAUSED THE PLANE TO HOP AND SKIP SIDEWAYS TO THE L. THE GRASS WAS CLUMPY AND DID NOT ALLOW EFFECTIVE BRAKING. THE GND BEGAN TO SLOPE RAPIDLY DOWNWARD WHICH DREW THE ACFT SIDEWAYS INTO A WOODED BRIAR PATCH.

I HAD ASSUMED THAT AS I WAS RECEIVING THE CHK THAT I WOULD BE ACTING AS THE PIC. SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS ON THE PART OF THE CHK AIRMAN; HOWEVER; MADE IT CLR THIS WAS NOT THE WAY IT WAS. AFTER A SHORT PREBRIEF ON HOW THE CHK WAS TO BE CONDUCTED; THE CHK AIRMAN ASKED ME TO COMPLETE THE PREFLT CHK ON THE ACFT ASSIGNED FOR THE CHKRIDE. I FOUND THE FOLLOWING DISCREPANCIES ON THE PREFLT. AT LEAST 1 OF THE FUEL GAUGES (OF 2) APPEARED TO BE INOP (OFF SCALE LOW) AND THE READING ON THE OTHER WAS SUSPECT AS IT INDICATED MORE FUEL IN THE TANK THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN PRESENT AFTER THE ACFT HAD FLOWN THE MORNING'S OUT AND BACK CARGO RUN. ADDITIONALLY; USING A SHORT STEPLADDER I COULD NOT SEE ANY FUEL IN EITHER TANK; THOUGH FROM THE ANGLE I WAS VIEWING; AND WITH THE BRIGHT GLARE OF THE SUN REFLECTING OFF THE WHITE SURFACE OF THE WING; THE TANKS STILL COULD HAVE BEEN 1/3 - 1/2 FULL WITHOUT ME SEEING THE FUEL THROUGH THE NARROW FILL OPENING. AS THE COMPANY HAS A WRITTEN POLICY THAT ALL ITS 210'S WILL BE FULL TO THE TOP FOR EVERY FLT LEAVING THE BASE ARPT (ABQ) (TO OFFSET THE FACT THAT MANY OF THEIR 210 FUEL GAUGES HAVE PROVED UNRELIABLE) I WENT BACK TO THE OFFICE TO ORDER A FUEL TRUCK TO TOP BOTH TANKS. I WAS STOPPED BY THE CHIEF PLT/CHK AIRMAN WHO TOLD ME THAT AS THE ACFT HAD ONLY FLOWN A 2 HR OUT AND BACK THAT MORNING IT HAD ENOUGH FUEL REMAINING (APPROX 3 HRS REMAINING) TO FLY A 1 HR CHK RIDE. I QUESTIONED THIS DECISION BY SAYING THE FUEL GAUGES APPEARED UNRELIABLE AND THAT I COULD SEE NO FUEL IN EITHER TANK FILLER NECK. WE THEN LEFT THE CHIEF PLT'S OFFICE TO FIND THE COMPANY PLT WHO HAD FLOWN THE ACFT PREVIOUSLY THAT MORNING. THE CHIEF PLT'S INTENT WAS TO CONFIRM THAT THE ACFT HAD IN FACT BEEN TOPPED THAT MORNING AND HAD ONLY FLOWN THE 2 HRS SCHEDULED. WITH THAT CONFIRMATION; WHICH THE OTHER COMPANY PLT PROVIDED; THE CHK AIRMAN WAS CONFIDENT THAT THE ACFT CONTAINED 3 HRS OF FUEL; IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THIS COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED BY THE GAUGES OR BY A VISUAL CHK OF THE TANKS' FUEL LEVELS. THE CHK RIDE CONTINUED WITH A TKOF; AND (FROM ABQ) DEP TO THE LCL PRACTICE AREA; OUTSIDE THE ABQ CLASS C AND NW OF AEG WHERE I PERFORMED (UNDER THE HOOD) STEEP TURNS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS; A STALL RECOVERY OR 2 AND SOME UNUSUAL ALT RECOVERIES. WE WERE OPERATING ON WHAT WE THOUGHT TO BE THE FULLEST TANK (GAUGE INDICATING APPROX 200 LBS). ABOUT 15 SECONDS AFTER THE UNUSUAL ALT RECOVERY AND A TURN TOWARD AEG TO ACCOMPLISH PRACTICE APCHS; THE ENG SUDDENLY LOST PWR. THE CHK AIRMAN TOOK THE ACFT IMMEDIATELY; RELEGATING ME TO WORKING THE RADIOS AND OPERATING THE BOOST PUMPS AS HE FLEW THE ACFT AND ATTEMPTED TO GET A RESTART (HE MANIPULATED THROTTLE; MIXTURE; FUEL SELECTOR; WHILE I CHKED MAGNETOS AND OPERATED BOOST PUMP SWITCHES AS HE CALLED FOR THEM). RESTART ATTEMPTS WERE UNSUCCESSFUL SO WE LANDED AT AEG ON RWY 4. SUBSEQUENT EXAMINATION OF THE TANKS REVEALED THE TANK WE WERE USING HAD ONLY A LITTLE FUEL REMAINING (NOT ENOUGH TO KEEP FROM 'UNPORTING' DURING THE UNUSUAL ALTS) WHILE THE OTHER TANK HAD SOMEWHAT MORE. EXACT QUANTITIES NEVER DETERMINED OR AT LEAST NOT REVEALED TO ME. I SUSPECT THE ACFT HAD FLOWN A PREVIOUS DAY'S SORTIE SINCE THE TANKS WERE LAST FILLED. THIS WOULD HAVE LEFT ONLY ABOUT AN HR'S FUEL ON BOARD.

I NOTICED THE THULE FOG WAS RIGHT TO THE TOP OF THE ALTAMONT PASS; AND FLOWING WESTERLY OVER THE HILLS TOWARD LIVERMORE ARPT. CONTINUING; AND AFTER PASSING APPROX OVER THE MANTECA VOR (ECA); I WAS GIVEN A HDOF TO ANOTHER CTLR; ON 125.1. I WAS REACHING THE LIMIT OF THEIR RADAR COVERAGE FOR THAT SECTOR; AND THE CTLR ADVISED ME RADAR SVC WAS TERMINATED; AND TO SQUAWK 1200. BY THIS TIME; IT WAS ALMOST DARK. I WAS JUST COMING TO THE NE EDGE OF THE THULE FOG AND SEEING LAND AGAIN. I ASKED AT THAT TIME; 'BEFORE GOING; COULD YOU VERIFY MY HEADING TO PINE MOUNTAIN LAKE?' AFTER A FEW SECONDS; SHE REPLIED; 'HEADING 110 DEGS;' AND I BELIEVE SHE SAID '28 MI.' 'YOU CAN CONTACT' WHAT I THOUGHT SHE SAID; 'ZOA; ON 120.95; AND THEY CAN HELP YOU FIND THE ARPT.' I KNEW ZOA CTLS THAT SECTOR AT THE HIGHER ALTS AND DIDN'T THINK ANY MORE ABOUT IT. PINE MOUNTAIN LAKE ARPT SHOULD BE ABOUT 12 O'CLOCK ABOUT 15 MI. I IMMEDIATELY QUESTIONED; 'HEADING 110 DEGS?' I INITIALLY QUESTIONED IN MY MIND THAT IT SEEMED LIKE A BIG HEADING CORRECTION. I DECIDE TO GIVE STOCKTON APCH ANOTHER CALL. I DIAL UP 120.95; THE GUY ANSWERS 'STOCKTON APCH.' MY INITIAL REACTION WAS; 'I THOUGHT THIS WAS ZOA'S SECTORS. WELL; MAYBE AT NIGHT THEY TAKE OVER EACH OTHER'S SECTORS AS BUSINESS SLOWS DOWN.' WRONG. AFTER BEING REIDENTED; I AGAIN ASK FOR A HEADING TO 'PINE MOUNTAIN LAKE.' HEADING 120 DEGS HE SAYS. I WHIP A 180 DEG TURN AND HEAD 120 DEGS. AFTER AWHILE HE SAYS; 'THE ARPT IS AT YOUR 1 O'CLOCK AT ABOUT 3 MI.' I STILL DON'T SEE IT. I SEE AGAIN THE BIG MOUNTAIN AT MY 11 O'CLOCK POS; WITH THE BIG STROBE AND RADIO TWRS. AS I PASS ABEAM OF IT (MY 9 O'CLOCK POS); I SEE A TOWN ABOUT 4 MI AT MY 12 O'CLOCK POS. 'THAT MUST BE GROVELAND; BUT THE ARPT IS IN THE WRONG PLACE. WHY CAN'T I SEE THE PINE MOUNTAIN LAKE 'LAKE'?' ALL THESE THOUGHTS PASS THROUGH MY MIND. THE CTLR NOW SAYS; 'THE ARPT IS 1 O'CLOCK; 1/2 MI. SURE ENOUGH; I LOOK ALMOST STRAIGHT DOWN. THERE IS AN ARPT. BY THIS TIME; ALL I WANT TO DO IS PUT IT ON THE GND. BUT WAIT; THERE ARE HANGARS ON THAT ARPT. PML DOESN'T HAVE HANGARS LIKE THAT. THE BEACON IS ALSO IN THE WRONG PLACE.

THE PROB BEGAN ON THE GND WITH THE OTHER PLT/PLANE BEFORE FLT. THE OTHER PLT BECAME ANGRY AT ME FOR ATTEMPTING TO FIX A QUESTIONABLE RADIO IN MY FRIEND'S ACFT WHICH THIS PLT WAS GOING TO FLY. I IGNORED THE CONVERSATION AND WENT ABOUT MY BUSINESS JUST BECAUSE THE PLT ALWAYS WANTS TO CAUSE SOME KIND OF TROUBLE/ARGUMENT WITH ANYONE. I HAD MY OWN PROBS. I HAD A CESSNA 150 THAT I JUST GOT DONE FLYING AND FOUND THAT THE PLANE WAS NOT RUNNING QUITE RIGHT. I DID SOME CHKING ON THE GND AND FOUND NOTHING. SO I DECIDED TO TRY TO DUPLICATE THE SOUND THAT I HEARD IN THE AIR. I DID A NORMAL PATTERN AND PROCEED TO PULL THE PWR AT THE SAME TIME I DID THE FIRST LNDG. DURING THIS TIME I FOUND NO WEIRD SOUND SO I PROCEED TO RETURN TO THE ARPT AND ENTER A NORMAL DOWNWIND WITH THE APPROPRIATE RADIO CALL AND VISUAL ALERTNESS. I CONTINUED TO SET THE ACFT UP FOR A LNDG AND MADE ANOTHER RADIO CALL IN THE PATTERN AT THE BASE LEG TURN. I THEN STARTED SETTING THE ACFT UP FOR A FINAL APCH. I MADE MY RADIO CALL AND PROCEEDED TO FLY THE FINAL APCH. AS I REACHED ABOUT THE TIME TO PULL THE PWR TO IDLE I SAW A PLANE PULL OUT ON THE RWY. THIS DIDN'T BOTHER ME BECAUSE PLTS DO THIS AND THEN MOVE OFF THE RWY SOON ENOUGH SO TO LET THE AIRPLANE ON FINAL LAND. WELL IN THIS CASE; THE PLT DID NOT MOVE OFF THE RWY AND DID NOT RESPOND TO MY RADIO CALLS AS WARNINGS OF MY POS. I THEN PROCEEDED TO MAKE ADDITIONAL RADIO CALL AT SHORT FINAL TO LET THE PLT KNOW THAT I WAS ALMOST DOWN. THE PLT CAME ON THE RADIO AND DELIBERATELY TOLD ME THAT HE WAS NOT MOVING OFF THE RWY AND THAT I SHOULD DO A GAR. WELL BY THE TIME THIS RADIO TFC ENDED I HAD PULLED THE PWR AND COMMITTED THE LNDG BECAUSE I THOUGHT HE WOULD LEAVE THE RWY ANYWAY; BUT HE DIDN'T AND I HAD TO LEAP FROG OVER THE OTHER PLANE THAT WAS BACK TAXIING ON THE RWY TO COMPLETE MY LNDG SAFELY. I REALIZE THAT I COULD HAVE DONE A GAR BUT I ALSO HAD OTHER OBSTACLES IN THE AIR; I HAD A PARACHUTE OFF MY NEAR R SIDE AND AN ACFT ON DOWNWIND AND I HAD PULLED PWR AND WAS AT LOW AIRSPD WITH FULL 40 DEG FLAPS. THE SIT PRESENTED ITSELF TO ME AND MY JUDGEMENT WAS TO LEAP FROG HIM TO A SUCCESSFUL LNDG AND DEAL WITH THE BAD JUDGEMENT OF THE OTHER PLT LATER. CESSNA 182 SKYDIVING/JUMPER PLANE; THIS WAS THE ACFT TAXIING. CESSNA 150 PRIVATELY OWNED WAS ON FINAL APCH TO LNDG. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: OTHER PLT TOOK AN ARGUMENT AND BAD ATTITUDE INTO THE AIR AND TRIED TO ARGUE IT OUT IN THE AIR. THE OTHER PLT PUT HIS LIFE AND THE OTHERS' ON BOARD LIVES IN DANGER DUE TO HIS INABILITY TO OBEY THE REGS AND COMMON SENSE TO MOVE OFF THE RWY. THE OTHER PLT'S ANGER OBSCURED HIS JUDGEMENT DURING HIS TAXI AND PROCEEDED TO DELIBERATELY/VERBALLY ON THE RADIO REFUSE TO EXIT THE RWY; INSTEAD HE CONTINUED TO BACK TAXI. BAD JUDGEMENT AND PROFESSIONALISM. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: LEAP-FROGGED OVER THE OTHER ACFT TO A SUCCESSFUL AND SAFE LNDG AT AN UNCTLED PVT ARPT. DISCUSSIONS OF REGS AND POSSIBLE VIOLATION ACTION AGAINST THE TAXIING ACFT AND PLT. PERSONAL MEETING WITH OTHER PLT TO DISCUSS WRONGFUL JUDGEMENT AND VIOLATION OF REGS. HUMAN PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS: BAD JUDGEMENT DECISION. ANGER AFFECTED THE TAXIING ACFT'S PLT'S THOUGHT PROCESS. TAXIING PLT BROUGHT AN ATTITUDE (BAD ONE) IN THE AIR. BEHAVIORAL MOODS DURING THE WHOLE ORDEAL CAUSED BAD DECISION MAKING. LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM. ACTIONS OR INACTIONS: NO ACTION WAS TAKEN BY THE TAXIING PLT TO AVOID A COLLISION. I MADE A MANEUVER TO LEAP FROG OVER THE OTHER ACFT TAXIING; AT A SLOW AIRSPD AND MADE A SAFE LNDG BEHIND TAXIING ACFT. THIS HOWEVER; MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THE BEST JUDGEMENT BUT AT THE TIME I HAD IT SEEMED TO BE THE SAFEST ONE AND IT TURNED OUT FINE. VIOLATION AND RULES; NO ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN TO VIOLATE OR REPRIMAND THE OTHER PLT. I HAVE LEFT THE ARPT ENVIRONMENT SO THAT I WILL NOT HAVE MY LIFE ENDANGERED BY THAT PLT.",,,,"NMAC AT A NON TWR ARPT. APCH LNDG ON OCCUPIED RWY.",

I WAS 30 SM FROM A REMOTE ARPT IN MONTANA. ABOUT 2 SECONDS LATER; 2 PWR LINES WENT OVER THE COCKPIT WINDOW; WE SAW THEM AND I INITIATED A SLIGHT CLB WHEN MY ACFT STRUCK THE SECOND SET OF PWR LINES. THE ACFT YAWED TO THE R WHEN THE LINES SNAPPED. I MANAGED DIRECTIONAL CTL; ADVISED THE UNICOM OF THE INCIDENT AND PROCEEDED IN THE DARK TO THE ARPT. LANDED UNEVENTFULLY. FACTORS WERE FLYING TOO LOW; UNFAMILIAR WITH AREA AND IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE THE WIRES. CORRECTIVE ACTION: KEEP ALT AT ACCEPTABLE LEVELS TO AVOID CONFLICT WITH WIRE; TERRAIN OR OTHER OBSTACLES. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR STATES THERE WAS VERY LITTLE DAMAGE TO THE ACFT. THE WIRE HIT THE TOP OF THE PROP LEAVING A SLIGHT NICK AND METAL FRAGMENTS. HAD THE PROP NOT TAKEN THE HIT; RPTR FEELS HE AND HIS PAX WOULD HAVE BEEN DECAPITATED. WHEN THE WIRE SNAPPED BACK IT HIT THE WINGTIP. HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE HAD HIT BY THE METALLIC SOUND WHICH HE WILL NEVER FORGET. HE DID NOT INTEND TO BE FLYING SO LOW. HE FEELS THE LIGHT AT DUSK WAS PART OF THE PROB. HE FLEW OUT OF A CANYON AND BELIEVED -- WOULD HAVE BET -- THAT HE WAS MUCH HIGHER THAN HE WAS. HE WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CTL AND CONTINUE ON TO ENNIS ARPT TO LAND IN THE DARK.

AT 2.75 HRS INTO A VFR XCOUNTRY FLT FROM IND; THE ACFT EXPERIENCED ENG FAILURE. VERY SHORTLY AFTER A RESTART; THERE WAS A SECOND FAILURE; IMMEDIATE ACTION WAS TAKEN TO LAND IN THE ONLY AVAILABLE OPEN SPACE -- THE PARKING LOT OF AN ABANDONED SPORTS ARENA WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS OF ST LOUIS. THE LNDG WAS SUCCESSFUL WITH NO INJURIES OR DAMAGE TO EITHER THE AIRPLANE OR PROPERTY. THE ACFT WAS FILLED WITH FUEL AT IND AND IT WAS VERIFIED BY VISUAL INSPECTION DURING THE PLT'S PREFLT THAT BOTH TANKS WERE IN FACT FULL. ACCORDING TO THE ACFT'S PERFORMANCE DATA; THERE WERE 22.5 USABLE GALS OF FUEL ON BOARD. ALSO; BOTH FUEL GAUGES READ FULL; EVEN THOUGH IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT FUEL GAUGES ARE NOT RELIABLE. THE PLANNED FLT TIME FROM IND TO SUS WAS APPROX 3.3 HRS; WITH A 20 MPH HEAD WIND. AT THE CRUISING ALT OF 4500 FT MSL; ENG AT 2500 RPM AND LEANED FUEL MIXTURE; THE ACFT PERFORMANCE DATA SHOWED THE EXPECTED FUEL CONSUMPTION RATE TO BE BTWN 4.2 GPH AND 4.9 GPH DEPENDING ON TEMP. WT AND BAL WERE WELL WITHIN THE ACFT'S LIMITS; THE COMBINED WT OF THE PLT AND PAX WAS 320 LBS; AND THERE WAS NO CARGO ON BOARD. USING 5.0 GPH AS THE PLANNED CONSUMPTION RATE; AND 1 ADDITIONAL GAL OF FUEL FOR CLB OUT; THE POTENTIAL DURATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN: (22.5 GALS-1.0 GAL) 5.0 GPH EQUALS 4.3 HRS. THIS WOULD PROVIDE A 1 HR RESERVE. THE FLT UP TO THE TIME OF ENG FAILURE WAS NORMAL AND OCCURRED EXACTLY AS PLANNED. UPON ENG FAILURE; THE L FUEL GAUGE INDICATED ABOUT 3/8 FULL AND THE R GAUGE INDICATED 1/4 FULL. EVEN AFTER LNDG; THE GAUGE READINGS DID NOT CHANGE UNTIL THE IGNITION SWITCH WAS TURNED OFF. UPON VISUALLY AND PHYSICALLY CHKING THE FUEL TANKS; THEY WERE BOTH FOUND TO BE ESSENTIALLY EMPTY. THIS SIMPLY UNDERSCORES THE UNRELIABILITY OF FUEL GAUGES. HOWEVER; RELIANCE WAS ON VISUAL INSPECTION PRIOR TO FLT AND RELIANCE THAT THE ACFT WOULD PERFORM CLOSE TO THE PUBLISHED PERFORMANCE DATA. AT NO TIME DURING THE FLT WAS THERE ANYTHING WHICH CAUSED ANY CONCERN WHATSOEVER ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF FUEL AVAILABLE. USING THE ACTUAL DURATION OF 2.75 HRS; THE ACTUAL FUEL CONSUMPTION BASED ON 22.5 GALS OF USABLE FUEL AND 1.0 GAL OF CLB OUT WAS: (22.5 GAL-1.0 GAL)/2.75 HRS EQUALS 7.8 GPH OR APPROX 60 PERCENT GREATER THAN THE ACFT'S PUBLISHED PERFORMANCE DATA. EVEN IF THE ONLY FUEL ON BOARD WAS THE 17 GALS ADDED IN INDIANAPOLIS; THE DURATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN 3.2 HRS; OR NEARLY 1/2 HR LONGER THAN ACTUAL. THE NUMBERS SIMPLY DO NOT SUPPORT THAT THERE WAS INADEQUATE FUEL ON BOARD. AT THE TIME OF RENTAL; THE ACFT OWNER DID NOT INDICATE ANY UNUSUAL FUEL CONSUMPTION HISTORY FOR THE ACFT; NOR WAS THERE ANY VISUAL MANIFESTATION OF A POTENTIAL PROB. HOWEVER; THE PLT IS NOT PRIVY TO THE MAINT HISTORY OF THE ACFT; NOR HAS THE OWNER COMMUNICATED ANY POST-INCIDENT INFO TO THE PLT ABOUT HIS ASSESSMENT OF THE SIT. IT IS SUSPECTED THAT THE OWNER HAS DISCOVERED A MALFUNCTION WHICH MAY BE MAINT RELATED. CONSIDERING THE FACTS STATED ABOVE; THE ENG FAILURE WAS DUE TO FUEL STARVATION INDUCED BY EXCESSIVE FUEL CONSUMPTION. THE SIT STRONGLY SUGGESTS SOME IRREGULARITY WITH THE PLANE'S PWR SYS (EG; A WORN ENG THAT HAS LOST ITS PERFORMANCE CAPABILITY); A LEAK IN THE FUEL SYS WHICH OCCURS ONLY WHEN THE ENG IS RUNNING; OR SOME OTHER MECHANICAL PROB. IF THERE IS AN ENG COMPARTMENT FUEL LEAK; THE POSSIBILITY OF AN INFLT FIRE WOULD CERTAINLY EXIST. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR DOES NOT KNOW WHERE THE FUEL WENT. HE WAS INTERVIEWED BY THE LCL FSDO WHICH FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH HIS FLT PLAN. HE WAS ASKED TO PLAN ANOTHER FLT OR TWO AND THE FSDO FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH HIS FLT PLANNING TECHNIQUE. THE FSDO DECIDED THAT THE 'PLANE WAS SICK;' AND THAT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A FUEL LEAK. THE FBO TRIED TO COLLECT $2600 RECOVERY COST FROM THE RPTR. THE RPTR AND HIS LAWYER COULD NOT GET ANY MAINT INFO FROM THE FBO.

I CONSIDERED ASKING CTR FOR 12000 FT ALTHOUGH THE WINDS AGAINST ME WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER. UNFORTUNATELY I ABANDONED THAT GOOD IDEA AND OPTED TO STAY AT 6000 FT WHERE; IT APPEARED I WOULD BE BTWN LAYERS AND MAKE BETTER TIME. A FEW MI FROM JOHNSTOWN THIS OPEN AREA CLOSED AND I BEGAN PICKING UP CLR ICE QUITE RAPIDLY. I ASKED ZOB FOR VECTORS TO AN APCH AT JST. THEY RPTED THE CONDITIONS THERE WERE 300 FT OVCST AND 3 MI. I WAS NOT SURE I WOULD SHED ANY ICE THERE ON MY WAY TO MINIMUMS AND IT APPEARED THAT I MIGHT BE IN REAL TROUBLE BEFORE I COULD GET LINED UP FOR THE ILS. PART OF ME WANTED TO RETURN TO ALTOONA (A LONG WAY BACK). CTR GAVE ME THE OPTION OF GOING ON TO LATROBE (20 MINS) I WAS HAVING A TOUGH TIME MAKING A DECISION AND SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME CONCENTRATING ON THE BUILDING ICE. CLEVELAND MADE THE CHOICE FOR ME BY GIVING VECTORS FOR A SHORT DOWNWIND TO JOIN THE ILS RWY 33 AT JST. I WENT BELOW THE APCH ALT OF 4600-(4000 FT) IN MY UNCONSCIOUS DESIRE TO PERHAPS MELT SOME OF THE BUILDING ICE. CTR GAVE ME THE ILS FREQ AND I FINALLY CALMED DOWN ENOUGH TO USE THE AUTOPLT TO GET OUT THE APCH PLATE. I BEGAN TO LOSE SOME ICE ON FINAL AT ABOUT 2900 FT AND LANDED WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. I'M INDEBTED TO THE CALM DECISIVENESS OF THE ZOB CTLR HANDLING ME. THIS WAS THE MOST ICE I HAD EXPERIENCED AND THE FIRST CLR ICE. IN RETROSPECT I SHOULD HAVE: TAKEN THE FIRST OPTION TO STAY OUT OF TROUBLE -- (CLR SPACE AT ALTOONA TO TOP THE OVCST); DONE AN IMMEDIATE 180 DEGS WHEN ENCOUNTERING THE FIRST ICE; USED THE AUTOPLT TO GET ORGANIZED FOR THE APCH AND CONCENTRATED ON FLYING THE AIRPLANE INSTEAD OF CONCENTRATING ON THE ICE WHICH ONLY INTENSIFIED MY GROWING PANIC. (AT THAT POINT THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO ABOUT THE ICE AND THE FASTEST WAY OUT OF THE MESS WAS TO SHOOT A FLAWLESS APCH TO MINIMUMS) I DID USE THE ANTI- ICE EQUIP AVAILABLE TO ME -- PROP BOOTS; PITOT HEAT AND WINDSHIELD DEFROSTER. I HAVE NO EXCUSE FOR THE SECOND ALT EXCURSION EXCEPT MY NERVOUSNESS ABOUT ICE THAT HAD BEEN RPTED AS NON-EXISTENT BY THE MALIBU.

AT APPROX XA00L I MADE A NO-GO DECISION; RENTED A CAR AND BEGAN A DRIVE BACK TO DAYTON. 1 HR INTO THE TRIP I STOPPED AND CALLED FSS. THEY RPTED IMPROVING WX (CEILINGS INCREASED FROM 1200 FT TO 1800 FT) FOR LOUISVILLE. THE REMAINING RTE OF FLT HAD RPTED IMPROVING CONDITIONS. I RETURNED TO LOUISVILLE; RECEIVED ANOTHER RPT WHICH WAS AGAIN IMPROVING (CEILINGS INCREASED FROM 1800 FT TO 2300 FT). AGAIN; THE RTE OF FLT HAD EVEN BETTER CONDITIONS. I MADE A GO DECISION AND LAUNCHED FROM LOUISVILLE AT XF00. THE PROB BEGAN WITH NOT UNDERSTANDING HOW THE PUBLISHED AIRMET AFFECTED MY RTE OF FLT. THE AIRMET WAS FOR POSSIBLE IFR CONDITIONS IN SOUTHERN INDIANA. HOWEVER; I ASSUMED SINCE RPTED WX FOR EACH AREA SDF; CVG WOULD BE GOOD FOR A 50 NM RADIUS OF THE ARPTS; MY ENTIRE RTE WAS VFR (VMC) AND IMPROVING AT MY DEST. ONCE ENRTE; THE TURN N OF SHELBYVILLE WAS UNEVENTFUL. I DECIDED; HOWEVER; TO TAKE A SHORT CUT WITHIN 15 NM OF NABB VOR. I DECIDED TO FLY 360 DEGS; FOLLOW THE RIVER AND INTERCEPT THE 44 DEG RADIAL AND THEN CONTINUE TO I73. THE PROB WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY APPARENT. I FIRST ENCOUNTERED A BIT OF LIGHT CHOP; AND A FEW MINS LATER; PASSED DIRECTLY THROUGH A SMALL CLOUD. MY FIRST REACTION WAS TO DSND. AFTER INITIATING A DSCNT I REALIZED THAT I WOULD HAVE TO DSND AT LEAST TO 1500 FT. I DECIDED THAT THAT WAS TOO LOW FOR FLT; ESPECIALLY NIGHT FLT; CONSIDERING A WORST CASE ENG LOSS SCENARIO. I THEN DECIDED TO INITIATE A CLB TO BREAK OUT ON TOP; KEEPING IN MIND THE RPTED CEILINGS OF 2400 FT FOR LOUISVILLE AND 4100 FT FOR CINCINNATI. THE ENTIRE TIME I COULD SEE MY LAND REFS AND THOUGHT I COULD SEE FOR SEVERAL MI AT 2000 FT. AS I CONTINUED TO CLB; HOWEVER; I CONCLUDED THAT WAS A BAD IDEA FOR 2 REASONS: FIRST; THERE WOULD BE A LAYER OF CLOUDS BTWN ME AND THE GND (OR MY FRIEND THE ARPT). SECOND; I WAS NOT SURE HOW HIGH THESE CLOUDS WERE; OR IF THERE WOULD BE SUFFICIENT ROOM BTWN ME AND THE 2 LAYERS OF CLOUDS. I DECIDED TO TURN TO THE NNE VARYING BTWN 030-060 DEGS TO GET AWAY FROM THIS LINE OF CLOUDS. THAT WAS A BAD DECISION. FOR NOW THE SIT WAS NOT EXTREME; HOWEVER; WHEN I FLEW THROUGH A CLOUD THAT TOOK MORE THAN AN INSTANT TO FLY THROUGH AND I HAD ZERO VISIBILITY; I DECIDED TO TURN TO 180 DEGS AND GET OUT OF THIS SOUP. MY NEXT DECISION WAS CTRED AROUND MY FUEL. I HAD BEEN UP FOR APPROX 1 HR NOW (10-15 MINS IN IMC) AND DID NOT THINK I COULD MAKE I73 WITHOUT A FUEL STOP. I DECIDED TO FLY DIRECT FALMOUTH VOR AND THEN LAND AT LUK; REFUEL AND MAKE A DECISION TO STAY OR CONTINUE. 1/2 WAY TO THE FALMOUTH VOR; THE CLOUD LAYER DISSIPATED AND RETURNED TO CONDITIONS I EXPECTED FROM MY WX BRIEF. I DID NOT PERCEIVE THE SIT TO BE A MAJOR PROB UNTIL I HAD BEEN IN THE PROB AREA FOR A GOOD 5-10 MINS. THE REASON WAS I COULD NOT SEE ANY OF THE CLOUDS I WAS RUNNING INTO UNTIL I PASSED THROUGH ONE. I COULD STILL SEE LIGHTS A GOOD 5-7 MI AWAY. I TRIED TO CONTINUE ON MY RTE BY FLYING 45 DEGS OFF COURSE AND FLY AROUND THE AREA OF CLOUDS. THAT ONLY MADE IT WORSE. MY MAIN OBJECTIVE WAS TO GET HOME. THAT MAY BE THE ROOT REASON BEHIND THE LACK OF MAKING AN IMMEDIATE DIVERT DECISION. ONCE I DECIDED I WAS IN OVER MY HEAD; HOWEVER; I REVERTED TO MY LOST PROCS TRAINING AND DIVERSION DECISION. I DID FEEL THAT I HAD LOST THE BUBBLE ON WHERE I WAS FOR SEVERAL MINS AS I WAS JUST TRYING TO MAINTAIN STRAIGHT AND LEVEL FLT WHILE I WAS IN A MIX OF CLOUDS. ALSO AFFECTING MY DECISIONS WAS THE UNBELIEVABLE FEELING THAT I WAS IN A PLACE I SHOULD NOT BE (IE; IN OVER MY HEAD). ONCE I DID MAKE A DECISIVE DECISION TO GO TO LUK; I BEGAN TO RELAX AND CALM DOWN. NOT KNOWING WHERE I WAS GOING WAS THE WORSE PART OF THE SIT. THE BASIC LESSONS LEARNED WERE: REALIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT A WX BRIEF DOES FOR A XCOUNTRY FLT; UNDERSTANDING THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING A DIVERT DECISION EARLY. WHY DID I NOT DO MY C'S? (CLB; COMMUNICATE; CONFESS; COMPLY). I THOUGHT INITIALLY THE SIT WAS NOT SEVERE ENOUGH; DID NOT WANT TO RISK LETTING SOMEONE KNOW I WAS IN A SIT I SHOULD NOT BE IN OR COULD NOT HANDLE (PRIDE).",,,,"A C150 PLT FLIES INTO CLOUDS AT NIGHT IN AN; APPARENTLY; DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO RETURN HOME.

I WAS ATTEMPTING TO TAKE OFF FROM A POPULAR ALASKA FISHING DEST; THE LAKE CREEK STRIP IN MY C150C. THE ACFT WAS IN GOOD MECHANICAL CONDITION; AND WAS MODIFIED WITH OVERSIZE TIRES AND HVY DUTY LNDG GEAR. THE WX IN THAT PART OF ALASKA HAD BEEN WARM THAT WK; INCREASING GLACIAL MELT AND RAISING THE LEVEL OF THE RIVER; WHICH DEFINES BOTH ENDS OF THE LNDG STRIP. AFTER LNDG; AND HAVING FOUND THE LNDG 'TIGHTER' THAN EXPECTED; I PACED OFF THE STRIP AND FOUND IT TO BE ABOUT 800 FT LONG. CONSULTING WITH THE ACFT OPERATING MANUAL; I DETERMINED THAT THE REQUIRED TKOF DISTANCE FOR THE CONDITIONS AT MAX GROSS WT WAS 748 FT. AS THE ACFT WAS WELL UNDER MAX GROSS WT; AND SINCE THE STRIP ENDED AT THE WATER'S EDGE; WITH NO TALL OBSTRUCTIONS AHEAD; I DETERMINED THAT A TKOF WAS POSSIBLE AND PLANNED TO ACCELERATE IN GND EFFECT OVER THE WATER IF NEEDED. UPON TKOF; HOWEVER; THE ACFT WAS UNABLE TO ESTABLISH A CLB; AND IN FACT BEGAN TO SETTLE OVER THE WATER. THE TIRES TOUCHED DOWN INTO THE WATER; COSTING NEEDED AIRSPD SEVERAL TIMES. WITH THE CONDITIONS OF DETERIORATING AIRSPD; AND LACK OF CLB; IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE ACFT WOULD NOT ATTAIN A FLYABLE CONDITION; AND I ELECTED TO DO A CTLED DSCNT INTO THE WATER. MANY WHO HAVE ATTEMPTED TO FORCE THE ACFT TO FLY AT TOO LOW AN AIRSPD HAVE SUFFERED LOW ALT; STALL SPIN ACCIDENTS; DRAMATICALLY INCREASING THE IMPACT FORCES. TO AVOID THIS; I CUT THE THROTTLE AND ENTERED THE WATER IN AN UPRIGHT ATTITUDE. THE WINDSHIELD BLEW INWARD FROM THE PRESSURE OF THE WATER; AND I EXITED THE ACFT AS IT SANK. THE ACFT WAS CARRIED DOWNSTREAM ABOUT 1 MI AND WASHED UP ON A SANDBAR; INTACT AND STILL UPRIGHT. DAMAGE; OTHER THAN WATER AND SILT INFILTRATION; WAS MINIMAL AND DID NOT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR NTSB RPTABILITY.

IN THE RUNUP AREA I RECALL A C172 AND A CHEROKEE BESIDES OUR C150. THE C172 DEPARTED FIRST WITH A L TURN; THEN WE WERE CLRED FOR TKOF WITH A STRAIGHT-OUT DEP. OUT CLBOUT SPD WAS 75-80 MPH. I RECALL HEARING ANOTHER ACFT BEING CLRED FOR TKOF WITH A STRAIGHT-OUT DEP BEHIND US. I ASSUME IT WAS THE CHEROKEE I SAW IN THE RUNUP AREA. PROBABLY BTWN 3 AND 4 MI OUT; I ASKED TWR FOR A FREQ CHANGE; SO I COULD PICK UP A SQUAWK CODE AND RADAR ADVISORIES FROM BOS APCH. TWR APPROVED MY FREQ CHANGE AND WE CONTACTED APCH. WE WERE IMMEDIATELY GIVEN A CODE AND I REQUESTED FLT FOLLOWING; DIRECT PUT. AFTER BEING ON THE BOS APCH FREQ FOR A SHORT TIME; PERHAPS 2 MINS; A PIPER CHEROKEE TYPE ACFT FLEW DIRECTLY OVER US EXACTLY ON OUR HDG. I RPTED THIS TO APCH; AND TOLD THEM THAT THE OTHER ACFT HAD COME WITHIN 50 FT OF US. IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE SEPARATION VERTLY WAS CLOSER TO 25 FT. LATERAL SEPARATION WAS NEARLY ZERO. I LEVELED AND BEGAN A SLIGHT R TURN. THE CHEROKEE BEGAN SLOWLY TURNING TO MY L AND APPARENTLY ON COURSE. THE TIME WAS APPROX XA10Z. FROM THE ACFT ACTIONS; I ASSUMED HE HAD NEVER SEEN ME. I FURTHER ASSUME THAT HE WAS STILL ON THE TWR FREQ AT THE TIME. I TOLD APCH THAT I WANTED TO FILE A NEAR MISS RPT. THEY TOLD ME I NEEDED TO DO THAT WITH THE FSDO. I SAID THAT I JUST WANTED THAT REQUEST ON THE TAPE. I ASKED APCH IF THEY SHOWED THE OTHER TARGET ON THEIR SCREEN. INITIALLY HE DID NOT RPT THE OTHER TARGET. PERHAPS 30 SECONDS LATER HE RPTED A TARGET AT 1900 FT AT MY 11 O'CLOCK POS. I TOLD APCH THAT THAT WAS THE OTHER ACFT. I HAD VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE OTHER ACFT AND I HAD ALREADY CLBED ABOVE IT. THE RANGE WAS PERHAPS 1 MI. THIS INDICATES THAT BOTH ACFT WERE SQUAWKING MODE C AND THE RADAR TAPES SHOULD TELL THE WHOLE STORY. WE REQUESTED AN ALT OF 4500 FT; BUT WERE INSTRUCTED TO REMAIN CLR OF BOSTON CLASS B AIRSPACE. I REMAINED AT ABOUT 2200 FT FOR SEVERAL MI; UNTIL THE CTLR CLRED US INTO BOSTON CLASS B AIRSPACE AT 4500 FT DIRECT PUT. I BELIEVE THAT THE OTHER PLT FAILED IN HIS DUTY TO SEE AND AVOID MY ACFT ON HIS DEP. THE FACT THAT IT WAS A 'HIGH WING/LOW WING' SIT MAY HAVE EXACERBATED THE PROB.

IT WASN'T A PERFECT SATURDAY FOR FLYING; A BIT HAZY; BUT STILL OVER 12 MI VISIBILITY. AT 5 MI OUT; I WAS ABLE TO GET IN A QUICK CALL TO LIMERICK FOR AN ARPT ADVISORY AND THEN; A COUPLE MINS LATER; A CALL TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE WERE 2 MI S OF THE ARPT. LIMERICK ITSELF WASN'T VERY BUSY WITH JUST 1 HIGH WING TAKING OFF AND HDG W. I KEPT AN EYE ON HIM TO MAKE SURE HE KEPT GOING W AND DIDN'T DECIDE TO MAKE A TURN INTO THE R-HAND PATTERN THAT'S STANDARD FOR RWY 28 AT LIMERICK. I ALSO LOOKED FOR OTHER TFC ALONG THE DOWNWIND LEG THAT MIGHT INTERFERE WITH OUR ENTRANCE INTO THE PATTERN AND WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE A RADIO; OR HAD FAILED TO MAKE USE OF THE ONE THEY DID HAVE. EVERYTHING LOOKED CLR. I THEN ANNOUNCED THAT WE WERE OVER THE FIELD AT 1400 FT TO ENTER A DOWNWIND FOR RWY 28 AT THE MIDPOINT. JUST AFTER XING OVER THE RWY; I LOOKED DOWN TO CHK THE WINDSOCK ON THE LIMERICK HANGAR AND GAUGE ANY XWIND I'D HAVE TO DEAL WITH ON FINAL APCH. WHILE I LOOKED FOR THE WINDSOCK; I NOTICED THE SHADOW OF OUR C150 GLIDING PEACEFULLY OVER THE LANDSCAPE BELOW. THEN; IN AN INSTANT; THAT PEACEFUL VIEW WAS SHATTERED AND WAS REPLACED BY AN IMAGE OF IMPENDING DISASTER. THE SHADOW OF OUR AIRPLANE WASN'T THE ONLY SHADOW ON THE GND. THE SHADOW OF ANOTHER AIRPLANE; A SHADOW OF ABOUT THE SAME SIZE; WAS OFF OUR STARBOARD WING AND WAS CONVERGING ON OUR SHADOW AT A 90 DEG ANGLE WITH ONLY SECONDS TO GO. I STARED AT THE SHADOWS WITH A FEELING OF DETACHED DISBELIEF. I NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING BUT THERE WAS NO DECISION I COULD MAKE. BASED ON THE SHADOWS ALONE; THERE WAS NO WAY TO KNOW IF THE OTHER PLANE WAS SLIGHTLY ABOVE; SLIGHTLY BELOW; OR EXACTLY AT OUR ALT. EVERY ACTION THAT RACED THROUGH MY MIND IN THAT MOMENT OF TIME SEEMED TO HAVE AN EQUAL CHANCE OF MAKING THINGS WORSE AS IT DID BETTER. AFTER WHAT SEEMED LIKE FOREVER; BUT WAS MORE LIKE 2 SECONDS; I QUICKLY TURNED MY HEAD TO THE R JUST IN TIME TO WATCH THE WING OF A C182 SLIDE UNDER THE TAIL OF OUR PLANE NO MORE THAN 20 FT BELOW US. IT WAS A CHILLING SIGHT. I QUICKLY LOOKED BACK TO THE L AND VISUALLY FOLLOWED THE PLANE AS IT CONTINUED ON ITS WESTWARD HDG. IT WAS AN 'ENRTE' ACFT; NOT INTERESTED IN LNDG AT LIMERICK. THE SHOCK EFFECT OF THE NEAR MISS KEPT ME FROM NOTING THE TAIL NUMBER OF THE OTHER PLANE UNTIL IT WAS TOO FAR AWAY TO READ THE REGISTRY. MY FEELING OF DISBELIEF GAVE WAY TO A FEELING OF NUMBNESS. I FORCED MYSELF TO PUT THE INCIDENT ASIDE LONG ENOUGH TO GET ON WITH THE BUSINESS OF LNDG THE PLANE. I PROCEEDED TO TURN THE PLANE ONTO THE DOWNWIND LEG AND WE COMPLETED THE PATTERN AND LANDED WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. AS WE TAXIED BACK TO OUR TIE-DOWN; MY WIFE AND I LET OUT A COLLECTIVE EXHALE THAT; WITHOUT WORDS; SAID WE KNEW WE HAD BEEN VERY LUCKY. HAD I SEEN HIM EARLY ENOUGH I WOULD HAVE TAKEN ACTION TO AVOID THE NEAR MISS; REGARDLESS OF RIGHT-OF-WAY; BUT BY THE TIME I SAW HIM THERE WAS NO TIME TO DO ANYTHING. FAR 91.127(C) STATES THIS GENERAL RULE: 'NO ACFT SHALL OPERATE IN AN ATA EXCEPT FOR THE PURPOSE OF LNDG AND DEPARTING THAT ARPT.'

A MALIBU LOOKING FOR THE OTHER FIELD MADE A LOW APCH DOWN ONE OF MY RWYS; AND THE THIRD WAS A FALCON JET AGAIN LOOKING FOR THE OTHER ARPT. THAT FLC TAKES THE CAKE. AT 100 FT AGL THEY WOKE UP AND REALIZED SOMETHING WAS AMISS. ON THE GAR THEY MANEUVERED EVASIVELY MISSING THE FIRST SOLO C150 STUDENT AT 300 FT AGL; BY 100 FT LATERALLY. PLTS (AIRPLANE DRIVERS OR WHEEL HOLDERS MORE APTLY DESCRIBES THESE INCOMPETENTS) NEED TO GET THEIR HEADS OUT OF THE COCKPIT. WITH THE ADVENT OF LORAN AND GPS FEW PLTS LOOK OUT THE WINDOW ANYMORE. PILOTAGE IS A LOST ART; AND WHEN SUDDENLY THE PLT ISN'T BEING LED BY THE HAND TO THE RWY THRESHOLD BY A RADAR CTLR; THEY ARE LITERALLY LOST. OURS IS A VFR TWR. THAT MEANS WE HAVE NO RADAR. WE SCAN OUT THE WINDOW. WE USUALLY SEE THE BONEHEADS COMING AND SCRAMBLE TO MOVE EVERYONE OUT OF THEIR WAY. SOMETIMES; BECAUSE WE SIMPLY ARE NOT TALKING WITH OR EXPECTING TFC; ONE SNEAKS UP ON US. IF YOU DON'T THINK WITNESSING A NEAR MIDAIR OF WHICH THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO IS TRY TO GET THE ONE YOU ARE TALKING WITH OUT OF THE WAY OF THE INCOMPETENT LOST PLT IN AN AIRPLANE MI AHEAD OF HIM CAN RUIN A CTLR'S WHOLE DAY -- THINK AGAIN. VERY RARE IS THE CTLR WHO WON'T WAKE UP MANY NIGHTS TO COME TO RELIVE THAT SCENE. HOW PEOPLE CAN RIDE AROUND IN LEARS; FALCONS; AND MALIBUS; AND NOT HAVE ANY IDEA WITHIN 10 MI OF THEIR LOCATION; IS COMPLETELY BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION.

THE MIL HELI RPTED A FLT OF 2 ON FINAL. I THEN PICKED THEM UP VISUALLY. ALL I SAW WAS 2 STEADY RED LIGHTS ABOUT 100 FT APART. I DID NOT SEE A FLASHING LIGHT/BEACON; OR STROBE. AS I APCHED ABEAM THE END OF RWY 23; THE HELIS WERE ON SHORT FINAL. SINCE I FIGURED THEY WOULD BE ON THE GND FOR A WHILE (HELI INDICATED THEY INTENDED TO DO 'CLOSED TFC'); I EXTENDED DOWNWIND; CALLED TURNING BASE AND FINAL. ON SHORT FINAL; AT ABOUT 100 FT MSL; I EXPERIENCED SEVERE TURB. THE C150 WENT INTO AN UNCOMMANDED 30 DEG BANK WITH SEVERE BUFFETING. I IMMEDIATELY DID A GAR. I THEN CALLED THE MIL HELI TO ASK WHAT TYPE; INFORMING THE PLT I HAD ENCOUNTERED SEVERE WASH. THE MIL HELI INFORMED ME THEY WERE 2 H53'S WHICH I BELIEVE IS THE LARGEST; HEAVIEST HELI IN THE MIL INVENTORY. ON THE NEXT PASS; I EXTENDED 2 MI UPWIND WHILE THE H53'S MADE ANOTHER LNDG. I AGAIN HAD TO ASK FOR THE HELI'S POS SINCE A BEACON/STROBE WAS STILL NOT VISIBLE TO ME. THE H53'S THEN TAXIED OFF THE ACTIVE AND REMAINED THERE UNTIL I COMPLETED SEVERAL MORE LNDGS AND TAXIED BACK TO THE PARKING AREA. THE 2 H53'S THEN TOOK OFF AND DEPARTED. THE HAZARDS I SEE IN THIS INCIDENT ARE: 1) MIL H53'S NOT USING PROPER UNCTLED ARPT ENTRY/PATTERN PROCS/VOICE PROCS (I BELIEVE THAT IF HELIS ARE USING THE FIXED WING PATTERN THEY HAVE TO COMPLY). 2) POSSIBLY CONDUCTING NIGHT FORMATION/LNDG TRAINING WITHOUT A BEACON VISIBLE. 3) MIL H53 NOT ANNOUNCING THAT THEY WERE H53'S OR 'HVY.' BEING A RETIRED MIL PLT; I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO SAFETY IF MIL PLTS; USING UNCTLED ARPTS FOR TRAINING; COMPLY STRICTLY WITH UNCTLED ARPT PROCS IN THE AIM -- AND IF THEY'RE HVY; THEY ADD IT TO THEIR VOICE CALLS.

WE PROCEEDED INBOUND FROM THE PRACTICE AREA AFTER COMPLETING SLOW FLT AND STALL SERIES; DURING WHICH; THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF ENG ROUGHNESS; LOSS OF PWR; OR DROP IN PRESSURE. HOWEVER; THERE IS A QUESTIONABLE PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE WE PROCEEDED WITH DEP STALLS WHERE OUR ATTN WAS DIVIDED ON TFC; CLRING TURNS; THEN MANEUVERING.

WE NOTICED A DRAMATIC CHANGE WHEN WE APPLIED PWR; SO WE ABORTED THE TKOF; TAXIED TO THE RAMP; NOTICING THE PRESSURE DROP; AND SHUT IT DOWN. THE A&P SHOWED US THE OIL EVACED OUT OF THE BOTTOM OF THE ACFT BLOWING THROUGH THE OIL HOSE THROUGH THE FIRE SHIELD COVERING THE HOSE. I LEARNED THE FIRE SHIELDS HAVE 2 PURPOSES: 1) TO PROTECT AGAINST AN OIL FIRE IF THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD SHOULD MALFUNCTION; 2) THEY ARE PLACED OVER THE HOSES FOR AESTHETIC REASONS. THE FORMER IS NOT A MANDATORY REQUIREMENT SINCE THESE LINES ARE AN AMPLE DISTANCE FROM THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD. THE LATER IS THE PRIMARY REASON FOR FIRE SHIELDS ARE INSTALLED ON THESE HOSES. FIRE SHIELDS INSTALLED ON THESE OIL HOSES PRESENT A DOUBLE PROB FOR CESSNA OWNERS AND OPERATORS: 1) MOISTURE BUILDS UP BTWN THE FIRE SHIELD AND OIL HOSE CAUSING DETERIORATION TO THE OIL LINES; 2) IT DOES NOT FACILITATE AN EASY VISUAL INSPECTION BY AN A&P DURING INSPECTION TIMES; NOR THE PLT BEFORE HE FLIES. SIMPLE VISUAL INSPECTION COULD PREVENT THIS COSTLY PROB; EVEN AN ACCIDENT. NO MSDR HAS BEEN FILED BY THE A&P ON DUTY; AND IS IN PART WHY I WISH TO FILE THIS RPT. BY NOT INSTALLING THESE FIRE SHIELDS TO GUARD AGAINST DETERIORATION AND TO MAKE VISUAL INSPECTIONS DURING PREFLT TAKES PRIORITY OVER THEIR FUNCTION TO PROTECT AGAINST A RUPTURED MANIFOLD EXHAUST.

I REDUCED PWR SETTING AND ENG SEEMED TO RUN NORMALLY; BUT PRODUCING LESS THAN FULL PWR. I INCREASED PWR SETTING; BUT ENG ONLY INCREASED SLIGHTLY IN PWR. HIGHEST PWR SETTING WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO SUSTAIN LEVEL FLT AND ENG PWR WAS CONTINUING TO DECREASE AT FULL THROTTLE. I ESTABLISHED BEST GLIDE SPD OF 70 MPH AND PICKED A FIELD OF SUFFICIENT LENGTH FOR SAFE LNDG TO MY L (W). I PERFORMED A 90 DEG L TURN AND BEGAN A FINAL APCH FOR LNDG IMMEDIATELY STRAIGHT AHEAD. I REDUCED PWR TO IDLE AND APPLIED FULL FLAPS; DSNDED; FLARED; AND LANDED AS I NORMALLY WOULD; APPLIED BRAKES UNTIL STOPPED. I OBSERVED THAT ENG WAS STILL RUNNING AT A NORMAL IDLE SPD; AND FOLLOWED NORMAL SHUT DOWN PROC. I THEN EXITED THE ACFT AND PROCEEDED TO CHK FUEL LEVELS BY VISUAL INSPECTION. UPON OPENING THE L TANK CAP; A RUSHING AIR SOUND WAS OBSERVED UNTIL THE CAP WAS COMPLETELY REMOVED. IT FELT AS THOUGH A SUCTION FORCE WAS RETAINING THE CAP AT FIRST. NO SUCH SOUND OR OBSERVATION WAS NOTICED UPON REMOVAL OF THE R CAP. FUEL QUANTITY IN BOTH TANKS WAS VISUALLY OBSERVED TO BE APPROX 1.5 - 2.0 INCHES (3-4 GALLONS PER TANK; 6-8 GALLONS TOTAL). PLT AND ACFT WERE UNDAMAGED. PLT'S CONCLUSION: THE FUEL VENTING SYS WAS PROBABLY BLOCKED (POSSIBLE INSECT INFESTATION). OWNER/PLT WILL HAVE FUEL VENT SYS INSPECTED PRIOR TO FURTHER OP OF ACFT. THIS ACFT HAS BEEN FLOWN BY SAME PLT FOR 40 HRS ON A REGULAR BASIS SINCE PURCHASE DATE; 45 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF THIS INCIDENT.

FUEL VENT WAS INSPECTED DURING PREFLT WITH NO ABNORMALITIES OBSERVED. IF INSECT INFESTATION (OR OTHER BLOCKAGE) IS BEYOND A POINT OF VISUAL DETECTION; THEN THERE IS NO WAY TO DETERMINE THIS PROB EXISTS PRIOR TO FLT; DURING A NORMAL PREFLT INSPECTION. BLOWING ON THE VENT TUBE IS PROBABLY UNDESIRABLE AS THIS WOULD EITHER FORCE THE OBSTRUCTION FURTHER INTO THE VENT OR ALL THE WAY INTO THE TANK; WHERE IT COULD CAUSE THE SAME OR OTHER PROBS LATER.

THE WING OF MY CESSNA 150 BLOCKED MY VIEW OF THE HELICOPTER. I FOLLOWED INSTRUCTIONS; BUT I'D HAVE LIKED MORE SEPARATION. AFTER CLRING RWY 21L; I HELD FOR YET ANOTHER TURBINE HELICOPTER MAKING AN APCH TO THE PERIMETER TXWY AND RAMP I WAS GOING TO USE. THIS HELICOPTER APCH WAS DESCRIBED BY THE TWR AS A 'CIRCLE THE TWR' TRAFFIC PATTERN. THIS PARTICULAR RAMP IS FREQUENTLY BUSY WITH PEDESTRIANS; ACFT; AND VEHICLES. THE TWR HAS BEEN RELIEVED OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE RAMP BECAUSE OF A LACK OF CTL OF VARIOUS USERS ON THE RAMP. HOWEVER; THE TWR DOES ISSUE ORDERS RELATED TO THE RAMP AREA. SEVERAL OTHER COMMENTS COME TO MIND. FIRST; RWYS 21R-3L HAVE TWO SETS OF HOLD LINES. THERE IS A SET OF HOLD LINES FOR WHEN ILS APCHS ARE BEING MADE; AND ANOTHER SET FOR VISUAL CONDITIONS. I'VE SEEN THIS CONFUSE PLTS AT FELTS IN THE PAST. I SUGGEST ELIMINATING THE VMC HOLD LINES AND EXPANDING THE RUN-UP AREAS AWAY FROM THE ILS HOLD LINES. THE ILS HOLD LINES SEVERELY TRUNCATE THE RUN-UP AREA FOR RWY 21R. SECOND; THE SOD RWY AT FELTS; AVAILABLE AT PLT REQUEST; RUNS PARALLEL BETWEEN THE L AND R PAVED RWYS. HELICOPTERS PARTICULARLY USE THIS SOD RWY; ALTHOUGH HELICOPTERS SOMETIMES ALSO USE THE SOD BETWEEN RWYS 3R- 21L AND THE PARALLEL TXWY. SHOULD THERE BE HOLD LINES FOR THE SOD RWY(S)? THE APPARENTLY SIMPLE TOPIC OF 'RWY TXWY INCURSIONS' HAS A LOT OF COMPLICATIONS WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO DETAILS. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR STATES THAT THE FIRST HOLD LINE ONE COMES TO WHEN TAXIING TO RWY 21R IS THE ILS HOLD LINE AND MOST PLTS WILL NOT CROSS THAT LINE. THIS MEANS THE RUNUP AREA IS CUT IN HALF AND LEAVES A LIMITED AREA FOR RUNUP. RPTR'S SUGGESTION IS TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE AREA IF THAT FIRST HOLD LINE IS KEPT. HE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE A LIMITATION ON USING BOTH THE SOD AND THE HARD SURFACE RWY AT THE SAME TIME AS THE SEPARATION IS VERY LIMITED. THERE ARE PLANS TO CLOSE THE TWR DUE TO LOW TFC COUNT EVEN THOUGH THERE IS GREAT USAGE BY MEDICAL HELIS AND FIXED WING AND A GREAT DEAL OF TURBINE TFC FOR CARGO OPS. THE OPTION IS THERE FOR THE LCL MUNICIPALITY TO ESTABLISH A CONTRACT TWR BUT LITTLE ENTHUSIASM TO PAY FOR IT.

NEITHER THE STUDENT NOR MYSELF SPOTTED ANY TFC SO I DIRECTED THE STUDENT TO EXECUTE A ONE-TURN SPIN TO THE R.

THE ACFT MAY HAVE PASSED AS CLOSE AS 600 FT HORIZLY FROM EACH OTHER. I FEEL THAT THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT WAS THE FAILURE OF MYSELF AND THE STUDENT TO ACQUIRE THE TANKER VISUALLY BEFORE INITIATING THE SPIN. THE ONLY EXPLANATION I CAN OFFER FOR THIS IS THAT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE TANKER WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL BELOW THE HORIZON AS WE CLRED THE AREA AT 4500 FT AND THE LOW VISIBILITY PAINT SCHEME MAY HAVE MADE THE ACFT BLEND IN WITH THE GND. ADDITIONALLY; THE AIRSPACE IN WHICH THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED IS RELATIVELY BUSY AND HAS A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF TFC OPERATING AT DIFFERENT SPDS. IN THE FUTURE I WILL CONDUCT SPIN TRAINING FURTHER FROM WICHITA WHERE THE TFC DENSITY IS LOWER.

WHEN APPROX 1 MI FROM THE ARPT; I SPOTTED A HELI JUST ABOVE THE TREE TOPS ON THE RWY 27 DOWNWIND SIDE HEADING IN THE DOWNWIND DIRECTION. I TOLD MY FRIEND TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE HELI WHILE I CHKED THE WINDSOCK TO SEE WHAT RWY I SHOULD USE. BOTH WINDSOCKS AND THE FLAG AT THE FBO WERE INDICATING RWY 27 WAS THE RWY TO USE. I THEN RPTED ENTERING DOWNWIND FOR RWY 27 ON THE UNICOM FREQ 123.0. THE ARPT IS UNCTLED AND THE FREQ IS 123.0. AS I WAS TRAVELING DOWNWIND ON RWY 27; THE HELI HAD CLBED TO APPROX 800 FT AND LOOKED AS IF HE WAS TURNING BASE LEG. WHEN I REACHED THE CORRECT POS; I CALLED L BASE LEG ON THE RADIO. I STILL HEARD NOTHING FROM THE HELI. WHILE ON BASE LEG; I NOTICED ANOTHER ACFT ABOUT 2 MI OUT AND IT LOOKED AS IF IT MAY BE ON FINAL FOR RWY 27. AFTER WATCHING; MY PLT FRIEND AND I CONCLUDED HE WAS TURNING AWAY SO I CONTINUED WITH MY BASE LEG. I STILL HAD HEARD NOTHING AND WAS WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THE HELI WAS DOING. AT THIS TIME THE HELI PASSED THROUGH FINAL LEG FOR RWY 27 AND WENT ACROSS. KNOWING MOST HELIS AROUND HERE USE A R HAND PATTERN; I WAS WORRIED HE WAS GOING TO TURN AND LAND ON RWY 27. HE WAS OCCUPYING MY ATTN PRETTY MUCH AT THIS TIME. I STILL HAD HEARD NOTHING ON MY RADIO. I CALLED FINAL LEG FOR RWY 27 WHEN I CONCLUDED THE HELI WASN'T LNDG AT THAT MOMENT. I NEVER HEARD CONFIRMATION HE HAD HEARD ME. JUST BEFORE I LANDED I NOTICED A TOMAHAWK TURNING OFF THE RWY. MY PAX COMMENTED THAT HE MUST HAVE HURRIED TO CROSS THE RWY BEFORE WE GOT THERE. NEITHER MY PAX OR I SAW THE TOMAHAWK PRIOR TO ITS TURNING. AFTER LNDG AND ON ROLLOUT; I NOTICED A TRAINER ON THE RWY 9 RUN-UP AREA; AND I COMMENTED TO MY FRIEND THAT THEY SHOULD BE USING RWY 27 AS THE WIND FAVORED IT; AND AT OUR UNCTLED ARPT THE WINDSOCK AND FLAG ARE THE ONLY VISUAL INDICATION OF WHAT RWY TO USE. I TAXIED TO MY DEST AND SHUT MY ACFT DOWN. MY FRIEND AND I GOT OUT AND NOTICED THE TRAINER PULLING UP WHERE I WAS; AND AN INSTRUCTOR GOT OUT AND HOLLERED AT ME FOR NOT USING MY RADIO AND I HAD FORCED A STUDENT THAT LANDED ON RWY 9 TO LEAVE THE RWY EARLY. UPON DISCUSSION WITH ME; I TOLD THE INSTRUCTOR THIS IS AN UNCTLED ARPT AND THE WINDSOCKS AND FLAG WERE INDICATING RWY 27 WAS THE ONE TO USE. HE ADMITTED HEARING MY CALLS ON DOWNWIND; BASE; AND FINAL LEGS; AND SAID HE KEPT CALLING ME TO NOT LAND; THEY WERE USING RWY 9. I SAID I HEARD NOTHING ON MY RADIO AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN INADVERTENTLY TURNED DOWN; BECAUSE SHORTLY BEFORE GETTING TO 33N I HAD BEEN MONITORING AN AWOS STATION AT SUMMIT ARPT ON 132.32. I TURNED MY PWR ON AND TURNED MY RADIO ON AND THE PRIMARY FREQ SHOWED 123.0 AND THE SECONDARY SHOWED 132.32. HE AGREED AND SAID IT MUST HAVE BEEN INADVERTENTLY TURNED DOWN; BUT I SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE TOMAHAWK LNDG. I SAID I CALLED AND RECEIVED NO ANSWER CONTRARY AND THE WIND BY ALL INDICATIONS SHOWED RWY 27 AS THE RWY AND MY ATTN HAD BEEN DIVERTED BY THE HELI AND THE PLANE OUT ON FINAL FOR RWY 27.

THE AIRPLANE WE WERE IN WAS A C150; TAIL NUMBER NXXX. WE DEPARTED CONCORD (BUCHANAN FIELD) AND HEADED STRAIGHT TO THE NE (HDG 060 DEGS) FROM THE FIELD. THE WIND WAS FROM THE SW AT ABOUT 20 KTS. THE SKY WAS BROKEN AT 2500 FT AGL WHEN WE IMMEDIATELY TOOK OFF; BUT APPROX 10 MI OUT FROM THE ARPT THE SKY WAS CLR. WE CLBED DIRECTLY TO 2000 FT MSL AND I INSTRUCTED MY STUDENT TO PUT THE AIRPLANE INTO A 'SLOW FLT' CONFIGN WHICH IS 40 DEGS OF FLAPS AND MAINTAINING LEVEL FLT AT APPROX 55 KIAS. HE PULLED THE THROTTLE BACK TO 1500 RPM; APPLIED CARB HEAT; EXTENDED FULL FLAPS (40 DEGS) AND LET THE AIRSPD DECREASE. THE AIRSPD WENT WELL BELOW 55 KIAS BEFORE HE ADDED PWR BACK TO THE ENG AND HE SPENT A FEW MINS TRYING TO GET THE AIRSPD BACK UP TO 55 KIAS. DURING THIS TIME; WE LOST ABOUT 200 FT IN ALT. I THEN TOLD HIM THAT IT WOULD BE TOO HARD TO GET BACK UP TO THE ALT AND SPD BECAUSE HE HAD LET THE AIRSPD GET TOO LOW TO BEGIN WITH; SO I TOOK OVER THE CTLS OF THE AIRPLANE AND TOLD HIM I WOULD DEMONSTRATE THE PROPER PROC FOR SETTING UP IN SLOW FLT. ONCE I TOOK THE CTLS I PUSHED THE THROTTLE COMPLETELY IN; TURNED OFF THE CARB HEAT AND RETRACTED THE FLAPS. I CLBED BACK UP TO 2000 FT MSL AND LET THE AIRSPD RETURN TO ABOUT 80 KIAS. (DURING THIS ENTIRE TIME; WE REMAINED ON A HDG OF 060 DEGS.) I THEN PULLED THE RPM BACK TO 1500 RPM; APPLIED CARB HEAT AND EXTENDED FULL FLAPS. AS SOON AS THE AIRSPD DECREASED TO 55 KIAS; I BROUGHT THE RPMS BACK UP TO 2000 RPM. I WAS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN LEVEL FLT IN THIS CONFIGN SO I GAVE THE ENG FULL THROTTLE AND TURNED OFF THE CARB HEAT. THE AIRPLANE STILL WOULD NOT REMAIN IN LEVEL FLT. I THEN TRIED TO LEAN THE MIXTURE OUT TO PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE PWR. EVEN AT PEAK; IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN ALT. THE RPMS WERE NOW AT ABOUT 2300 RPM; FLAPS WERE STILL AT 40 DEGS. THE FOLLOWING EVENTS HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY. AS I LEANED THE MIXTURE TO PEAK AND REALIZED IT STILL WOULD NOT STAY LEVEL; I DECIDED THAT THE CURRENT CONDITIONS (IE; OUTSIDE TEMP) WERE NOT GOING TO ALLOW US TO ADEQUATELY PRACTICE SLOW FLT (I WAS AT ABOUT 1800 FT MSL); SO I RETRACTED THE FLAPS AND INITIATED A CLB BACK TO 2000 FT MSL. I WENT BACK TO LEANING THE MIXTURE; AT PEAK EGT I WAS ABOUT TO ENRICH THE MIXTURE WHEN THE ENG WENT TO IDLE. I PUSHED MIXTURE FULL RICH; I WAS STILL AT FULL THROTTLE AND THE CARB HEAT WAS STILL OFF. I WAS AT ABOUT 1900 FT MSL WHEN THIS HAPPENED. THE ENG DID NOT SPUTTER AND DIE; IT JUST IMMEDIATELY WENT TO IDLE PWR. THE PROP WAS WINDMILLING. OUR HDG AND THE STRONG TAILWIND HAD CARRIED US OUT OVER THE WINDMILL FARM THAT IS LOCATED ABOUT 10 MI NW OF THE ANTIOCH BRIDGE ON THE N SIDE OF THE RIVER. THEREFORE; AS SOON AS I REALIZED MY ENG HAD FAILED I PITCHED THE AIRPLANE FOR 60 KIAS (BEST GLIDE SPD) AND INITIATED 180 DEG R TURN. ONCE I WAS TURNED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND GLIDING BACK IN THE DIRECTION OF CONCORD ARPT (AND AWAY FROM THE WINDMILL FARM) I WAS AT ABOUT 1500 FT MSL. I INITIATED THE EMER ENG RESTART PROC AS INDICATED ON THE EMER CHKLIST. I MADE SURE MIXTURE WAS FULL RICH; THROTTLE WAS ALL THE WAY IN; I TURNED ON THE CARB HEAT; MADE SURE THE FUEL SELECTOR WAS ON; CHKED EACH MAGNETO INDIVIDUALLY AND MADE SURE THE PRIMER WAS LOCKED. THE ENG DID NOT RESPOND. I TUNED THE XPONDER TO 7700. I ALSO BEGAN ADJUSTING THE THROTTLE; THINKING THAT IF SOMEHOW THE FUEL LINE HAD BEEN CLOGGED I COULD USE THE THROTTLE TO PUMP FUEL THROUGH THE CLOG. AS I MOVED THE THROTTLE IN AND OUT; THE ENG WOULD SPUTTER; BUT STILL NOT REGAIN PWR. WHILE I WAS DOING THIS I ANNOUNCED MY EMER OVER 119.7 (CONCORD TWR FREQ). I ANNOUNCED THE EMER AS FOLLOWS: 'CONCORD TWR; CESSNA XXX; 10 MI NW OF THE ANTIOCH BRIDGE; WE'VE HAD AN ENG FAILURE; THIS IS NOT A DRILL; WE ARE MAKING AN EMER LNDG. THERE ARE 2 PEOPLE ON BOARD.' IMMEDIATELY AFTER THIS; I WENT THROUGH THE EMER RESTART PROC A SECOND TIME EXACTLY THE SAME ORDER AS BEFORE EXCEPT THIS TIME I STOMPED ON THE FUEL SELECTOR VALVE WITH MY HEEL TO ASSURE IT WAS DOWN FAR ENOUGH. THERE WAS STILL NO RESPONSE FROM THE ENG. SO; I WENT BACK TO ADJUSTING THE THROTTLE AS THIS WAS THE ONLY THING THAT MADE THE ENG RESPOND AT ALL; IT CONTINUED TO BARELY SPUTTER AS I ADJUSTED THE THROTTLE. AT THIS POINT I WAS 500-800 FT MSL. AS I HAD HEARD NOTHING IN REPLY TO MY ORIGINAL EMER BROADCAST OVER THE RADIO; I ANNOUNCED THE EMER AGAIN AS FOLLOWS: 'MAYDAY; MAYDAY; MAYDAY; CONCORD TWR; THIS IS CESSNA XXX; 10 MI NW OF THE ANTIOCH BRIDGE. WE'VE HAD AN ENG FAILURE AND WE'RE MAKING AN EMER LNDG. WE'RE A CESSNA 150; 2 PERSONS ON BOARD.' NOW; REALIZING THAT THE ENG WAS DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO RESTART; AND ALSO REALIZING OUR HEADWIND WAS TOO STRONG TO ALLOW US TO GLIDE BEYOND THE HILLS THAT WERE BELOW US; I LOOKED FOR A LONG ENOUGH FLAT SPOT AMONGST THE HILLS TO LAND. ABOUT 400 FT MSL; I FOUND A SPOT TO LAND; EXTENDED FULL FLAPS AND LANDED THE AIRPLANE. AS SOON AS WE LANDED; I RADIOED TO CONCORD TWR THAT WE WERE ON THE GND AND THAT NO ONE WAS INJURED. I DO NOT RECALL AT WHAT POINT THE ENG STOPPED RUNNING ALTOGETHER AND THE PROP STOPPED WINDMILLING. I SHUT OFF THE IGNITION AFTER LNDG; BUT I THINK THE PROP HAD ALREADY STOPPED BEFORE THAT. AS FAR AS I COULD TELL THERE WAS NO DAMAGE TO THE ACFT (A 3 INCH PLASTIC PIECE OF THE NOSEWHEEL FAIRING CRACKED OFF); AND THERE APPEARED TO BE NO PROPERTY DAMAGE. AGAIN; THE EVENTS I DESCRIBED ARE AS BEST AS I CAN RECALL. ALL ALTS ARE ESTIMATED AFTER THE POINT THAT THE ENG INITIALLY DIED.",,,,"C150 INSTRUCTOR HAD ENG FAILURE; REQUIRING A FORCED LNDG.",

I WAS ASKED IF I COULD TAXI OR NEEDED ASSISTANCE. I TOLD THE TWR I HAD PWR TO TAXI. I TAXIED TO THE GA AREA AND SPOKE WITH THE RESCUE CREW. THEY TOOK MY NAME; PHONE NUMBER; AND ADDRESS. I ASKED IF I NEEDED TO FILL OUT ANY MORE PAPERWORK OR CONTACT ANYONE; AND THEY SAID NO. AN A&P MECH LOOKED AT THE ACFT AND COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG; EXCEPT THE THROTTLE WAS SET TOO LOW. YOU COULD PULL PWR TO IDLE AND WAIT A FEW SECONDS AND THE ENG WOULD STOP. I BELIEVE WE ENCOUNTERED CARB ICE. THE THING THAT TOOK ME BY SURPRISE WAS THAT I WAS ALWAYS UNDER THE ASSUMPTION YOU COULD NOT GET CARB ICE UNLESS YOU WERE IN VISIBLE MOISTURE. THE SKY WAS CLR AND THERE WAS NOT A CLOUD IN SIGHT. THE TEMP WAS ALSO ABOVE THE FREEZING LEVEL. THE OTHER THING IS THAT I THOUGHT WITH CARB ICE; THE RPM SLOWLY DROPS; NOT AN INSTANT DROP TO IDLE. THE A&P SAID WE PROBABLY ENCOUNTERED CLR AIR ICE AND WHEN THE CARB GOT CLOGGED UP; THE ENG WENT TO AN IDLE SETTING. AND BECAUSE THE IDLE WAS SET SO LOW; THAT IS WHY THE ENG WAS ABOUT TO QUIT. THE WAY THIS COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED WOULD HAVE BEEN TO HAVE THE THROTTLE SET HIGHER BEFORE FLYING AND TO KNOW THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE NOT IN VISIBLE MOISTURE; AND THE TEMP IS ABOVE FREEZING; YOU CAN STILL ENCOUNTER CARB ICE. IF WE HAD KNOWN HOW MUCH THE AIR COOLS GOING THROUGH THE CARB; WE COULD HAVE SUBTRACTED THAT FROM THE OUTSIDE AIR TEMP AND CHOSEN A SAFER ALT.",,,,"INSTRUCTOR PLT IN A C150; WITH A PVT PLT STUDENT ON A XCOUNTRY TRAINING FLT; DECLARED AN EMER AND DIVERTED TO LAND AFTER THE ENG LOST PWR AND ALMOST QUIT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.",

ONCE FIELD WAS MADE; I ADDED FULL FLAPS; CUT PWR AND PROCEEDED TO GND EFFECT. AT THIS POINT; I REALIZED WE WERE IN GND EFFECT LONGER THAN USUAL FOR 80 MPH AND I EXPECTED TOUCHDOWN. I QUICKLY LOOKED AT GEAR LIGHT AND REALIZED GEAR LIGHT WAS YELLOW; NOT GREEN. I ADDED FULL PWR; PULLED BACK ON YOKE AND HEARD A SCRAPE. WE BEGAN A SLOW CLB; ABOUT 200 FPM. I HAD 80 MPH ON AIRSPD INDICATOR. I TOOK OUT 10 DEGS FLAPS AND GOT TO 250-300 FPM. THE END OF THE RWY WAS UPON US. I REDUCED FLAPS FROM 20 DEGS TO 10 DEGS FLAPS; KEPT 80-82 MPH AND APPROX 300-350 FPM CLB TO PATTERN. I DID A FULL GAR; RPTED TO LCL TFC ON DOWNWIND; LOCKED GEAR DOWN; VERIFIED GREEN LIGHT AND WHEELS DOWN OUTSIDE WINDOWS BY MYSELF AND 2 PAX. I PROCEEDED TO LAND WITHOUT DELAY OR ANY OTHER OCCURRENCE. AFTER TAXIING BACK; THE INSPECTION OF THE PLANE SHOWED DAMAGED PROP; TORN OFF ANTENNA; AND SCUFFED MARKER BEACON. I CONSIDER MYSELF EXTREMELY LUCKY. VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE GEAR AND GREEN LIGHT IS A MUST. I THOUGHT I HAD PULLED THE HANDLE OVER THE LOCKING LEVER. IN ACTUALITY I HAD ONLY LIFTED IT OUT AND RESET IT INTO LOCK. THE GEAR HORN ON THIS PLANE DOES NOT WORK. THIS PIECE OF EQUIP WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE INCIDENT AS WELL. I ALSO COULD HAVE USED MY PAX TO CHK THE WHEELS LIKE I DID ON THE FIRST 2 LEGS OF THE FLT. I USED A PRINTED CHKLIST AND SIMPLY DID NOT VERIFY GEAR DOWN AND LOCKED. 2 OTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTORS COULD HAVE BEEN HEAT OR THE FATIGUE DUE TO HEAT (TEMPS WERE ABOVE 90 DEGS ALL DAY); AND THE VISIBILITY FACTOR FROM THE HAZE AND SUN'S ANGLE. I ALSO HAD 5 HRS OF FLYING IN 3 LEGS OF 2; 1.5 AND 1.5; HOWEVER; THE MAJORITY OF THIS WAS DONE UNDER IFR FLT PLANS WITH AUTOPLT AND GPS NAV GUIDANCE FOR ALL 3 LEGS. THE TEMPS AND DENSITY ALTS WERE ALSO ELEVATED. HOWEVER; I DO NOT KNOW THEIR EFFECT IF ANY. IN THE END; HOWEVER; SIMPLY VERIFYING THE GEAR WAS DOWN AND LOCKED COULD HAVE PREVENTED ALL OF THIS. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: PLT RPTS THAT RECENT MAINT HAD BEEN DONE ON THE ACFT TO INSTALL GPS. SINCE THAT TIME; THERE WERE NUMEROUS PROBS WITH THE GEAR WARNING SYS THAT COULD NOT BE RESOLVED SO SYS WAS RENDERED INOP. NO PLACARD TO THAT EFFECT WAS INSTALLED. HE ALSO RPTS THAT THE ARPT WAS VERY DEMANDING WITH OBSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH THE APCH AND DEP ENDS WITH A RWY THAT NARROWS DURING ROLLOUT. ATTRIBUTES THIS AS A CONTRIBUTION TO FAILURE TO ASSURE GEAR DOWN. PLT IS AWARE OF AN MEL FOR THE ACFT BUT HAS NOT REVIEWED IT FOR REF TO REQUIRED PLACARDING OR RESTR TO GEAR DOWN ONLY FLT THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN REQUIRED FOR THIS OP. WHILE RELIGIOUS ABOUT CHKLIST USE; PLT RECOGNIZES THAT IN RETROSPECT HE MAY HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH THE WORDS AND MOTIONS WITHOUT REALLY SEEING THAT THE TASKS WERE COMPLETED.",,,,"C210 PLT TOUCH-AND-GO WITH GEAR UP.

I WAS TRYING TO TRACK THE SMO 312 DEG RADIAL AND THEN A LARGE JET WAS APCHING MY WAY TO LAND AT VNY ARPT. I TURNED AND MADE A QUICK DSCNT TO GET OUT OF ITS PATH.

WE BROKE OUT OF THE OVCST AT 4500 FT AND COMPLETED THE FLT VFR. LEARNED SEVERAL THINGS FROM THIS INCIDENT: 1) EVEN A VERY SCATTERED LAYER BELOW CAN MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO IDENT LANDMARKS AND SPOT ARPTS. I SHOULD HAVE EXECUTED A 180 DEG TURN WHEN I NOTICED THE LAYER BELOW BUILDING UP. 2) I WILL NOT IN THE FUTURE RELY ON AUTOMATED WX RPTING.

I HAVE ABOUT 100 HRS TAILWHEEL EXPERIENCE; BUT NOT MUCH TIME IN THIS TYPE AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO GET MORE EXPERIENCE IN IT. BECAUSE OF WT CONSIDERATIONS WE FILLED THE R TANK TO THE TOP AND LEFT A BIT OVER A 1/3 IN THE OTHER TANK. OUR TRIP WAS PLEASANT AND UNEVENTFUL. WE DID 2 OR 3 TOUCH-AND-GOES WHEN WE RETURNED TO THE HOME FIELD. AFTER THE LAST LNDG; WE TAXIED TO THE RAMP. MY FRIEND GOT OUT AND TOLD ME TO TAKE IT AROUND A FEW TIMES. I WAS DELIGHTED AT THE OPPORTUNITY AND TAXIED BACK TO THE ACTIVE RWY. I DID 5 OR 6 LNDGS; ALWAYS WITH COMPANY IN THE PATTERN; BUT WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH MY WORK. I WAS DETERMINED TO DO 3 GOOD ONES THEN COME BACK IN. WHEN I WAS ALMOST AT PATTERN ALT ON THE LATEST CLBOUT I NOTICED THE GAUGE READ 1/4 OR LESS. STARTLED; I LEVELED OFF AND SWITCHED TANKS; NOTING THAT THE APCH END OF RWY 33 WAS JUST BELOW ME. THE GAUGE READ OVER 1/3. I WAS RELIEVED AND CONTINUED MY PATTERN. AS I CLBED OUT ON UPWIND FROM THE NEXT TOUCHDOWN THE ENG BEGAN TO STUMBLE. I WAS NO MORE THAN 400 FT OFF THE GND; IF THAT MUCH; AND AS THE AIRPLANE STARTED DOWN I CHKED THE THROTTLE AND MIXTURE WERE FULL IN WHILE I LOOKED FOR A PLACE TO LAND. THE WIRES AHEAD OF ME SEEMED TOO CLOSE TO RISK SO I MADE A L TURN TOWARD AN OPEN AREA THAT SEEMED FLAT. I TRIED TO GLIDE AS WELL AS POSSIBLE . ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER TOUCHDOWN I WAS THROWN FORWARD. THE NEXT MOMENT I WAS UPSIDE DOWN. I UNBUCKLED THE SEATBELT AND CRAWLED OUTSIDE; THEN REACHED IN AND TURNED OFF THE MAGNETOS AND MASTER SWITCH. FORTUNATELY; I WAS UNHURT. THE ACFT IS AT THIS WRITING EXPECTED TO BE REPAIRABLE. MY MIND SET WAS WRONG FROM THE BEGINNING WHEN I TOOK OFF SOLO. FIRST; BECAUSE I FLY GLIDERS ALMOST EVERY DAY; I AM USED TO THE SENSATION OF AN ACFT THAT STAYS ALOFT EASILY WITHOUT PWR AND I THINK I HAVE DEVELOPED AN UNHEALTHY FEARLESSNESS OF UNPWRED FLT THAT IS SUBCONSCIOUS. THAT IS NOT A GOOD ATTITUDE TO OPERATE FROM WHEY FLYING PWR PLANES. SECOND; ALL MY PWR TIME IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS HAS BEEN IN LARGER AIRPLANES WITH LARGE FUEL TANKS. I NOW REALIZE THAT THE DIFFERENCE BTWN 1/3 AND THE 1/4 FULL IN THE C120 IS JUST 1 GALLON; OR 10 MINS OF FUEL. OBVIOUSLY THAT IS CLOSE ENOUGH TO MAKE ME WANT TO HEAD FOR HOME WHEN I'M NEAR 1/3 ON MY FULLEST TANK. THE THIRD AND PERHAPS WORSE PROB WAS MY DETERMINATION TO SUCCEED ON MY GOAL OF 'PERFECT LNDGS' WITHOUT REGARD TO OTHER FACTORS. IN THE FUTURE I WILL KNOW MY ACFT AND BRING INTO SHARP FOCUS THE PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS WHICH IT PRESENTS TO ME. I WILL NOT ALLOW MY SITUATIONAL AWARENESS TO BE DISTR BY MY PERSONAL EXPECTATIONS AND GOALS FOR A GIVEN FLT OP. AND I WILL UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BTWN A PWR PLANE AND A GLIDER.",,,,"C120 PLT FLIES TO FUEL STARVATION IN THE TFC PATTERN AT 61B AND LANDS OFF FIELD.",

I THEN LOOKED BACK TOWARD THE WINGTIP AND FOUND 3 MORE RIBS DAMAGED SOME WITH QUESTIONABLE PATCH REPAIRS. IN ADDITION THE WING HAD BEEN MODIFIED WITH A BUSHE STOL (SHORT TKOF AND LNDG) LEADING EDGE CUFF (PROBABLY TO STIFFEN UP THE DAMAGED AND REPAIRED RIBS). AS I LOOKED THROUGH THE 1095 I FOUND THAT THE STOL CUFF WAS INSTALLED BY PERSONS UNKNOWN PROBABLY 10 OR 15 YRS AGO AND A REPUTABLE INSPECTION AUTH HAD APPROVED AND SIGNED OFF THE WORK AS ACCOMPLISHED BY PERSONS UNKNOWN AND HAD ENDORSED THE 337 (1995) AS AIRWORTHY. I KNOW THE INSPECTION AUTH AND I THINK HE JUST DIDN'T LOOK VERY CLOSE AT THE WORKMANSHIP AND REMAINING BENT AND DAMAGED RIBS AS THERE IS ONLY ONE ACCESS PANEL FOR THE ENTIRE LEADING EDGE AND VERY HARD TO INSPECT. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE I SIGNED OFF AN ANNUAL ON THIS AIRPLANE LAST YR THAT WAS OPEN AND CLOSED UP BY ANOTHER A&P; AND I KNOW I LOOKED IN THE WING; BUT ONLY AT THE STRUT ATTACH POINTS AND SUPPORTING BOLTS. SO I'M HAVING THE WING INSPECTED BY THE INSPECTION AUTH THAT SIGNED IT OFF IN 1995 AND ALTHOUGH THE WING IS STRUCTURALLY STRONG ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING I DOUBT THAT A WHOLE LOT OF FAA INSPECTORS WOULD APPRECIATE OR EVEN APPROVE OF THE EXISTING RIB REPAIRS. MY GUESS IS THAT THE INSPECTION AUTH THAT APPROVED THE REPAIR BY THE UNKNOWN PERSONS WILL OFFER THE (CURRENT) OWNER A RE-RIBBING STRUCTURAL REPAIR OF THE WING AT COST JUST TO GET AWAY FROM THE POSSIBLE FUTURE SCRUTINY BY THE FAA.",,,,"A CESSNA 150 UNDERGOING A 100 HR CHK IS FOUND TO HAVE 6 SUBSTANDARD UNAPPROVED WING RIB REPAIRS NOT DISCOVERED IN LAST 2 ANNUAL INSPECTIONS.",

AFTER TKOF WE TURNED AS CLRED R; AND WHEN WE WERE ABEAM THE TWR; ON R DOWNWIND; I INSTRUCTED MY STUDENT TO RPT OUR POS TO THE TWR; WHICH HE DID. WE RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING CLRNC; ACFT X #3 BEHIND A CHEROKEE (I AM NOT SURE WHETHER IT WAS A CHEROKEE OR ANOTHER LOW WING AIRPLANE) ON L BASE TO A 2 MI FINAL. I SAW THE CHEROKEE WHEN IT TURNED FINAL; APPROX 2 MI FROM THE THRESHOLD; IN A 2 O'CLOCK POS IN RELATION TO MY DOWNWIND. I HAD A CHANCE TO CALL THE TWR WHEN WE WERE ABEAM THE CHEROKEE BUT RECEIVED NO ANSWER (ACFT X HAS TFC IN SIGHT); I TRIED A SECOND TIME AND THEN A THIRD TIME BEFORE PROCEEDING BEHIND MY TFC. I WAS ABOVE THE LIE; ABOUT 4 MI N OF THE ARPT AND 2-3 MI BEHIND MY TFC WHICH I HAD IN SIGHT. WHEN I WAS ESTABLISHED ON FINAL THE TWR SUDDENLY REMEMBERED ME AND ASKED ABOUT MY POS; WHICH I RPTED. IN AN URGENT CALL THEY TOLD ME I HAD NOT BEEN CLRED TO TURN BASE; WITHOUT ISSUING ANY FURTHER CLRNC. OBVIOUSLY THE FACT THAT I HAD NOT BEEN CLRED WAS MORE IMPORTANT TO THEM THAN RESOLVING THE SIT WITH A CLRNC. UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT I WAS IN A DANGEROUS POS FOR MYSELF AND FOR OTHERS I TURNED BACK TO DOWNWIND IN A 180 DEG SHALLOW R TURN. FULLY AWARE THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE A GOOD DECISION; BUT SINCE THE TWR WAS MAKING A PRIORITY FROM THE FACT THAT I HAD NOT BEEN CLRED; I WAS LEFT WITH NO FURTHER INSTRUCTION. WHILE BEGINNING THE MANEUVER I CALLED TWR TO INFORM THEM AND EXPECTED AN IMMEDIATE ANSWER. IN THE MEANTIME THEY HAD LOST INTEREST IN ME AND ONCE MORE I WAS IN A NO-CLRNC SIT. AFTER A WHILE (ABOUT 2 MINS); THEY CAME BACK TO ME AND GAVE ME SOME INSTRUCTIONS TAKING ME TO AN 8 MI FINAL; WAY OUT OF THEIR CLASS D AIRSPACE. WHEN I FINALLY MADE IT TO THE ARPT THEY ASKED ME TO DISCONTINUE TOUCH AND GOES SINCE I WAS NOT ABLE TO FLY THE PATTERN. AND I MUST AGREE THAT I CANNOT FLY SUCH AN UNPREDICTABLE PATTERN THAT EXTENDS OUT OF THEIR CTLED AIRSPACE. SUPPOSEDLY I INTERFERED WITH THE NORMAL FLOW AND OTHER AIRPLANES (WHICH IS POSSIBLE). HAD TWR GIVEN ME A CLRNC RATHER THAN A LECTURE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR EVERYBODY. FRG HAS A LIMITED RADAR SVC (BRITE) AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO BETTER SERVE THE PLTS. NOT ANSWERING A CALL 3 TIMES IS NOT ACCEPTABLE; AND WHEN A PLT DOES NOT ANSWER 3 TIMES THEY GET REALLY UPSET. HOW COME THEY DON'T LIVE BY THEIR OWN RULES? MORE IMPORTANT: REGARDLESS OF ANY MISTAKE I MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT HAVE DONE; THE RIGHT PRIORITY IS TO ISSUE A CLRNC; CONTINUE ON FINAL; TURN R 180 DEGS; FLY A HEADING OF...AND THEN ONLY TO INFORM THE PLT THAT HE WAS NOT CLRED. RADIO FREQS AND PATTERNS ARE NOT THE PLACE FOR MISPLACED PRIDE OR AUTH CONTEST: REGARDLESS OF HOW UPSET I MAY BE WITH ATC I NEVER EVER ARGUE ON THE FREQ. THIS RPT IS NOT AN ISOLATED FACT BUT IT IS A TREND IN FRG WHERE ANYTHING SMALLER THAN A CITATION IS BARELY TOLERATED. I FLY FROM THIS ARPT ABOUT 5 DAYS A WK; 3 FLTS A DAY; AND HEAR MANY SIMILAR PROBS. ON THE OTHER HAND; LONG ISLAND ARPT (ISP) 15 MI TO THE E WHERE I GO ALMOST AS OFTEN AND DO MY TOUCH AND GOES BTWN AIRLINERS NEVER HAD A PROB OF THIS TYPE. MAKE YOUR OWN CONCLUSION. I AM NOT SURE I MADE A MISTAKE BUT CONTINUING ON DOWNWIND MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A BETTER COURSE OF ACTION. I MAY HAVE NOT ACTED AS WELL AS I COULD HAVE BUT I STILL BELIEVE THAT FRG TWR DID NOT DO ITS JOB CORRECTLY: ANSWERING MY CALLS; GIVING INSTRUCTION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE; LEAVING THE COMPLAINTS FOR A MORE APPROPRIATE TIME (OFF THE AIR).",,,,"RPTR QUESTIONS THE FRG LCL CTLR SITUATIONAL AWARENESS OF THE INCIDENT; WHETHER THEY RECEIVED A CLRNC TO TURN BASE.",

I WAS PARKED NEAR THE DEP END OF THE RWY; SO I HAD TO TAXI DOWNWIND WHICH GAVE ME A GOOD VIEW OF THE APCH. I COULD SEE NO TFC AND THE RADIO WAS QUIET. CHKLIST COMPLETE AS I APCHED TXWY F; I KNEW I COULD TAKE IT SAFELY FROM THERE; BUT AS I WAS IN NO PARTICULAR HURRY AND THERE WASN'T ANY INBOUND TFC THAT MIGHT CAUSE AN EXTENDED GND DELAY I ELECTED TO TAXI FURTHER DOWN TO TXWY E. WHEN TAKING OFF SINGLE ENG OVER WATER; ONE TENDS TO THINK ABOUT SUCH THINGS AS ALT WHEN XING THE BEACH. AS I PASSED TXWY F; A C130 CALLED TWR AND RECEIVED CLRNC TO CROSS RWY 2 AT TXWY K; NEAR THE DEP END. A BARELY PERCEPTIBLE CHANGE IN THE SOUND AND FEEL OF THE PLANE WHILE TAXIING CAUGHT MY ATTN. THE ASPHALT ON THIS SECTION OF TXWY IS NOT IN GREAT SHAPE AND IN SOME PLACES IS COMING APART; 'COULD WHAT I'M SENSING BE THE PAVEMENT; OR IS IT THE ENG?' TUNING MY SENSES TO THE SOUND OF THE ENG; I NOTICED A METALLIC TAPPING -- THE SOUND OF A VALVE LIFTER NOT QUITE PUMPED UP. IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME; AS I'VE LONG SUSPECTED I'D HAD A LIFTER THAT OCCASIONALLY GOES FLAT. IT MAKES A NOISE AND VIBRATION THAT PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE NOTICED BY THE OCCASIONAL PLT OR PAX; BUT SINCE I FLY THIS ACFT OFTEN; I NOTICE. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SHORT DURATION PROB; GOING AWAY SHORTLY AFTER THE PWR IS APPLIED FOR TKOF. NEVERTHELESS; THE DEP IS OVER WATER; AND I MADE THE DECISION TO GO WITH IT AS LONG AS I GOT SMOOTH PWR ON TKOF; OTHERWISE I'D ABORT. SCAN THE HORIZON FOR ACFT; NOTHING. SCAN THE GND; THE ONLY THING ON THE ARPT THAT'S MOVING BESIDES ME IS THE C130 XING DOWNFIELD. TXWY E INTERSECTS THE RWY AT A 45 DEG ANGLE; SO THAT I HAD TO MAKE A 135 DEG TURN TO THE R TO LINE UP. SATISFIED NOW THAT WHAT WAS BOTHERING ME WAS ONLY A NOISY LIFTER AND -- THERE NOW; IT'S GONE -- THE ENG'S QUIET AND SMOOTH ONCE AGAIN. SUDDENLY; I ASKED MYSELF WHETHER I WAS CLRED FOR TKOF. THE ANSWER WAS NO. I THEN ASKED MYSELF WHETHER I HAD BEEN CLRED INTO POS. THE ANSWER ONCE AGAIN WAS NO. MY CLRNC WAS TO TAXI TO THE RWY; NOT TXWY ONTO THE RWY. I APPLIED BRAKES AND STOPPED; FACING 45 DEGS FROM THE APCH END OF RWY 2. A QUICK CHK OF MY POS PUT ME 1/2 WAY TO THE CTRLINE OF THE RWY; WELL PAST THE HOLD LINE. I KNEW THAT THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE DANGER FROM TFC; THOUGH I QUICKLY SCANNED THE APCH END; FOUND NOTHING; THEN TURNED TO LOOK DOWNFIELD; SEEING THE C130 AS IT CLRED THE RWY. I WAS NOT IN IMMEDIATE DANGER; NOR WAS I AN IMMEDIATE HAZARD TO OTHERS. 3-4 SECONDS AFTER I FIRST REALIZED SOMETHING WAS AMISS; I KEYED THE MIKE AND SAID 'UH; XXX IS READY.' THERE WAS ANOTHER 3-4 SECOND DELAY AS THE TWR CTLR SURVEYED THE SIT AND ISSUED HIS DECISION; 'CLRED FOR TKOF.' 'CLRED FOR TKOF' WAS MY REPLY. WHILE THE CLRNC 'TAXI TO RWY...' IMPLIES 'HOLD SHORT;' THOSE WORDS ARE OFTEN NOT SPOKEN. MY MIND KNOWS THE RULES; BUT UNLESS I MAKE IT A POINT TO SAY TO MYSELF 'HOLD SHORT;' EITHER THROUGH HEARING THE WORDS SPOKEN; A VERBAL READBACK; OR EVEN THROUGH INTERNAL DIALOGUE; THE LIMIT OF MY CLRNC IS NOT SET. WITHOUT THE LIMIT SET; IT HAS TO BE SET WHEN THE INTXN IS APCHED. THE PAINT ON THE TXWY INCLUDING THE HOLD LINE AT THE ECHO INTXN IS OLD; AND WHILE VISIBLE; IT DOES NOT CATCH THE EYE; AND DISTR AS I WAS; I DID NOT SEE THE HOLD LINE; THOUGH I KNOW IT'S THERE. I MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT THE QUESTION OF THE LIMIT OF MY CLRNC UNTIL AFTER I'D CROSSED THE LINE. I RAN THE VIRTUAL STOP SIGN; THE HOLD LINE THAT IMPLIES 'PROCEED IF YOU HAVE CLRNC; STOP IF YOU DON'T.' FAILURE TO SET THE LIMITS OF MY CLRNC AS IT WAS RECEIVED WAS PROBABLY THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT. MY CONCERN FOR THE HEALTH OF MY ACFT AND THE SANITY OF WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO DO DEMANDED MY IMMEDIATE ATTN AS I WAS TAXIING. THE LACK OF TFC AND RADIO CHATTER MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTEDBY ALLOWING MY THOUGHTS TO STRAY AWAY FROM ATC AND OTHER ACFT. THE LACK OF CUES TO REMIND ME TO REVIEW THE LIMITS OF MY CLRNC DEFINITELY PLAYED A PART. PERHAPS A RED-LIGHT; GREEN-LIGHT SYS AT TXWY INTXNS WOULD HELP.

TOLD MY PAX TO WATCH FOR ACFT IN THE PATTERN; AS I WOULD DO ALSO; AND TO PUMP THE GEAR DOWN WHILE I SET UP FOR LNDG. I ASSUMED THAT WHEN ALL ELECTRICAL WAS GONE; MY XPONDER HAD FAILED AND THEY WOULD BE LOOKING FOR ME IN THE PATTERN. I TURNED EASTERLY ABOUT 090 DEG HDG AND THEN ENTERED THE L DOWNWIND (NOW TRAVELING N) IN A NORMAL FASHION WHICH PUT ME ABOUT 1 MI E OF RWY 17L.

AS FAR AS ALT; I SORT OF MADE IT UP AS I WENT ALONG AND ENDED UP SOMEWHAT DUPLICATING WHAT I USUALLY GET ON A TYPICAL VISUAL APCH ON IFR RULES INTO LUK. THIS HAPPENED ON MY SCHEDULE IN WHICH I FLY 6 LEGS IN ABOUT 7 HRS OF FLT AND 12 HRS OF DUTY TIME. IT IS SINGLE PLT IFR IN A C210. I TRY TO FLY IT LIKE IT IS A HVY JUMBO JET AND I OFTEN MODEL MY RADIO PHRASEOLOGY AFTER THE JUMBO JET PLTS. WHAT REALLY CAUSED THIS OCCURRENCE (I BELIEVE) WAS A COM RADIO MALFUNCTION. IF I COULD HAVE HANDLED THE SIT AND EVENTS AFTER THE RADIO MALFUNCTIONED BETTER; I WOULD HAVE. I DIDN'T THINK TO SQUAWK LOST COM FOR QUITE A WHILE AFTER THE PROB WAS DETECTED AND THEN I COULD NOT REMEMBER IF 7600 WAS LOST COM OR 6500 WAS LOST COM. AND I DECIDED THAT KEEPING MY IFR ASSIGNED SQUAWK CODE WAS BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE AT THE TIME. I FLEW DIRECT CVG VOR TOWARD THE DEST ARPT FOR A LONG TIME AND SORT OF HAD IT BACKED UP WITH MY YOLK MOUNTED GPS UNIT. THE LAST ASSIGNED RTE WAS 'DIRECT' CVG VOR THEN 'DIRECT' LUNKEN AND THAT IS WHAT I WAS DOING; BUT I GOT A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED AS FAR AS HOW CLOSE I WAS.

I GOT AN ARPT IN SIGHT AND THOUGHT THAT THAT WOULD DO; AND THEN I REALIZED IT WAS COVINGTON INTL. MOMENTS LATER; I FOUND COVINGTON. I SPOTTED LUK IN DISTANCE UNDER SOME CLOUDS; AND I WAS UNSURE IF I COULD GET IN TO LUK WITHOUT GOING IMC. THEN I REALIZED FROM CURRENT POS TO LUK I WOULD HAVE TO CROSS FINAL APCH COURSE (CVG) AT FINAL APCH ALT.

I TURNED ON LNDG LIGHT AND NAV LIGHTS IN ADDITION TO STROBE AND BEACON THAT WERE ALREADY ON. ON FINAL; I SAW AN AIRLINER THAT WAS LINED UP WITH RWY AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY REALIZED THAT IT WAS GOING AWAY FROM ME ON A DEP. THIS WAS A RELIEF; BECAUSE I KNEW I WAS AT LEAST SOMEWHAT GOING THE RIGHT WAY. I DIPPED AND ROCKED WINGS AND PITCHED NOSE UP AND DOWN ON FINAL ALL WHILE KEEPING A NORMAL GS AND NORMAL SPD INTO RWY AND ROLLED OFF RWY AS SOON AS I SAFELY COULD AND SHUT DOWN ON A TXWY. I WAS ESCORTED INTO FBO AND MET MY COURIER THERE AND LEFT THE PLANE ON THE RAMP FOR REPAIR TO BE MADE BY MY COMPANY. I RODE BACK TO LUK (DEST ARPT) WITH THE COURIER AND THE LOAD.

I HAD BEEN CONTINUOUSLY MONITORING THE CTAF AND HAD A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE AREA TFC. ONE PLANE LANDED AND THEN I JOINED THE PATTERN AS #2 BEHIND A C340 ON L DOWNWIND RWY 27. I FLEW RELATIVELY SLOWLY; 70 MPH IAS; AND WE BOTH MADE PROGRESSIVE POS RPTS. I EXTENDED MY DOWNWIND TO ALLOW THE C340 TIME FOR THE ANTICIPATED BACK TAXI. AS HE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD; I TURNED TO L BASE. WHEN I ROLLED OUT ON A LONG; HIGH FINAL (2 - 2 1/2 MI); I SAW HIM COMPLETING A 180 DEG TURN ON THE RWY. I WENT TO FULL FLAPS AND 60 MPH IAS AND FELT I HAD LOTS OF TIME FOR HIM TO CLR. MY TOUCHDOWN WAS IN AN UNEXPECTED TAILWIND GUST BUT NOT UNCOMMON FOR TEX. I CONTINUED MY LNDG ROLLOUT; THINKING THE RWY WAS CLR. I SAW THE C340 BACK-TAXIING TOWARD ME WHEN I WAS 500 FT (APPROX) AWAY AND WELL BELOW FLYING SPD. HE WAS NEAR THE N EDGE OF THE RWY FOR THE TURNOFF (TXWY A2); SO I MOVED TO THE S EDGE OF THE RWY. I RADIOED MY EMBARRASSMENT AND APOLOGIES TO HIM AS I NEARED. HE SAID HE HAD SEEN ME ALL THE TIME AND WAS NOT WORRIED. I WENT BY HIM ON THE RWY AT A FAST TAXI SPD. OUR WINGTIPS CLRED (R TO R) BY ONLY 30-35 FT. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: I BELIEVE THE MAIN CAUSE IS THAT I HAD GROWN SOMEWHAT COMPLACENT. ADDITIONALLY; I MAY HAVE GROWN OVERCONFIDENT IN MY ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY SEQUENCE MYSELF INTO THE TFC PATTERN. TEX USUALLY REQUIRES A BACK TAXI ON A RWY 27 LNDG. IT NEEDS ANOTHER TXWY. THERE WERE SCATTERED CLOUDS ABOVE 7000 FT AGL AND THEIR SHADOWS WERE MOVING AT ABOUT TAXI SPD. THIS MADE THE MOVEMENT OF THE TAXIING C340 MORE DIFFICULT TO DISCERN. I CHOSE NOT TO MAKE A GAR BECAUSE I SAW THE C340 SO LATE. THE 200 FT TOW ROPE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE OF A HAZARD. I HAVE GIVEN PREVIOUS THOUGHT TO GARS WITH THE ROPE ATTACHED. I KNEW THEY HAD TO BE HIGHER (INITIATED SOONER) OR THE RWY CLRED TO THE SIDE TO AVOID GND HAZARD. IT'S POSSIBLE I COULD HAVE RELEASED THE ROPE; BUT I WAS SO SURPRISED TO SEE THE C340; I DIDN'T THINK OF IT. WITH 20/20 HINDSIGHT; IT WAS BETTER TO CONCENTRATE ON ACFT CTL MORE FULLY: RAISING FLAPS; AGGRESSIVE BRAKING AND STEERING TO THE L. POSITIVE FACTOR -- THINGS DONE RIGHT: BOTH PLANES HAD BEEN MAKING POS RPTS SO THE C340 KNEW I WAS BEHIND HIM. I HAD MY LNDG LIGHT ON SO I WAS MORE VISIBLE. BECAUSE OF THE DEMANDING NATURE OF OPERATING INTO/OUT OF TEX; MOST PLTS ARE AT AN INCREASED LEVEL OF AWARENESS. WHILE I CERTAINLY WASN'T; I'M GRATEFUL THE C340 PLT WAS. TEX IS CERTIFIED TO PART 139 STANDARDS. I WOULDN'T HESITATE TO USE THE GRASSY SAFETY AREA IF I WOULD HAVE NEEDED IT. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: COMPLACENCY IS SNEAKY. I WILL BE MORE AWARE OF ITS NATURE BY CONSCIOUS ATTN TO IT. IF I DON'T ACTUALLY SEE A PLANE CLR THE RWY IN FRONT OF ME; I WILL REQUEST 'CONFIRM DOWN AND CLR.' I WILL CONTINUE TO USE THE LNDG LIGHT; BOTH ON TKOF AND LNDG. I WILL SEQUENCE MYSELF BETTER IN ORDER TO FLY A MORE STANDARD TFC PATTERN.

MC 032 AT 5500 FT. WINDS WERE FORECAST (AND APPEARED) WESTERLY NEAR 20 KTS; SO MY MAGNETIC HDG WAS ABOUT 010 DEGS. #1 WAS MONITORING BUT NOT IN CONTACT WITH RICHMOND APCH 132.85 SECTOR. ACFT #2 APPARENTLY WAS NWBOUND; LEVEL ABOVE (OR DSNDING VERY SLOWLY INTO) THE SAME ALT; AND EITHER IFR OR VFR ADVISORIES WITH RIC APCH. COURSES CROSSED AT NEAR R ANGLES. HOW THE PROB WAS DISCOVERED: #1 HEARD RIC APCH CALL TFC FOR #2 'AT YOUR 9 O'CLOCK; 1 MI...HDG N AT 5500 FT' OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT. AFTER A SHORT DELAY; I HEARD #2 INFORM RIC APCH THAT THEY HAD 'TFC IN SIGHT.' RECOGNIZING THAT MY DIRECTION AND ALT MATCHED THE RIC DESCRIPTION; I IMMEDIATELY BEGAN LOOKING FOR #2 ON MY R (E) SIDE; AS I ASSUMED TFC MIGHT BE OUT OF RIC. I ROLLED MY R WING UP BUT WAS UNABLE TO LOCATE #2. I THEN BEGAN LOOKING BEHIND AND BELOW ME; UNDER BOTH WINGS. STILL UNABLE TO LOCATE TFC (I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF #2'S ALT); I RETURNED TO FORWARD SCAN AND IMMEDIATELY SPOTTED #2 AT MY 1-2 O'CLOCK POS; ROUGHLY 1/3 MI AHEAD AND ABOVE ME +100-150 FT. ACFT #2 APPEARED TO BE IN NEAR LEVEL FLT ON A NEAR R ANGLE XING COURSE. GIVEN MY HDG AND ALT (ABOUT 5600 FT; MY MODE C READS SLIGHTLY LOW); I LATER CONCLUDED #2 WAS HDG ABOUT 300 DEGS (ASSUMING A SMALLER WCA) AT AN ALT OF ABOUT 5750 FT. I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED LEVEL VFR XING TFC AT AN EVEN-PLUS ALT; YIELDING A 1000 FT SEPARATION. IFR WOULD (SHOULD) HAVE HAD BETTER SEPARATION -- UNLESS DSNDING ENRTE. (POSSIBLE BUT UNLIKELY: THERE ARE MOUNTAINS W OF; AND NO PUBLIC AIRFIELDS ANYWHERE NEAR THIS LOCATION.) CORRECTIVE ACTIONS NEEDED: IT PROBABLY TOOK AT LEAST 3-4 SECONDS TO ASSESS AND CONFIRM A POTENTIAL COLLISION COURSE (IE; CONSTANT ANGLE OF CONVERGENCE); DURING WHICH BOTH ACFT CONTINUED TO CLOSE RAPIDLY. I WENT NOSE DOWN; TO IMMEDIATELY INCREASE VERT SEPARATION; PREPARATORY TO A R TURN TO PASS CLR AFT OR; AND GIVE WAY TO; ACFT #2. AS I DID SO; AND BEFORE MY R TURN WAS EXECUTED; #2 SUDDENLY DIVED THROUGH MY ALT WHILE PASSING R TO L (W) AHEAD OF ME; AT A DISTANCE OF NOT MORE THAN 250 YARDS. I ROLLED R (E) IMMEDIATELY AND PASSED CLR; AFT OF #2 AT NOT MORE THAN 200 YARDS HORIZ; AND -200 FT VERT SEPARATION (#2 NOW BELOW #1). THEREAFTER; I LOST CONTACT WITH #2 AND HEARD NOTHING MORE ON 132.85; FROM EITHER #1 OR RIC. HUMAN PERFORMANCE FACTORS; PERCEPTIONS; JUDGEMENTS; DECISIONS AND ACTIONS OR INACTIONS: GIVEN THAT #2 RPTED 'TFC IN SIGHT;' I WAS SURPRISED THE SIT DEVELOPED AS IT DID. UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES; I WAS THE BURDENED ACFT; REQUIRED TO GIVE WAY. TO DO THAT; HOWEVER; ONE MUST HAVE THE OTHER ACFT IN SIGHT; WHICH I DID NOT (IMMEDIATELY). MY FIRST REACTION ON ACQUIRING 32 SO CLOSE BY WAS SURPRISE (AND; PERHAPS; DISBELIEF). THIS ONLY INCREASED RESPONSE DELAY. ONCE I MADE CONTACT AND ASSESSED THE SIT; I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE TURNED R; BEFORE DROPPING THE NOSE; SO AS TO SIGNAL CLRLY MY SIGHTING OF #2 AND INTENTIONS (TO PASS AFT OF IT). LEARNINGS: FIRST; I LEARNED HOW QUICKLY 'PROX' CAN TURN INTO 'NEAR MISS.' SECOND; WHENEVER OPERATING NEAR N OR S (IE; ACROSS DIRECTIONAL ALT DEMARCATIONS); COURSE/HDG CHANGES; FOR WHATEVER REASON; MAY CREATE CONFLICTS WITH OTHER ACFT AND/OR CONFUSE A RADAR CTLR. ONCE STABILIZED ON TRACK; IT IS IMPORTANT TO HOLD COURSE AS STEADY AS POSSIBLE AT THE APPROPRIATE ALT. THIRD; WHEN ENCOUNTERING CONFLICTING TFC; IT IS IMPORTANT TO HOLD COURSE AS STEADY AS POSSIBLE AT THE APPROPRIATE ALT. THIRD; WHEN ENCOUNTERING CONFLICTING TFC; IT IS IMPORTANT TO MANEUVER SO AS TO GIVE CLR INDICATIONS OF INTENDED ACTIONS TO THE OTHER ACFT. DELAY OR INDECISION ONLY ADDS UNCERTAINTY -- AND RISK. FOURTH; WHENEVER RPTING 'TFC IN SIGHT' IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT SAME MAY NOT BE THE CASE FOR THE OTHER ACFT. RIGHT-OF-WAY DOES NOT RELIEVE ONE OF RESPONSIBILITY TO AVOID INCIDENTS.

I VERIFIED FULL FUEL INDICATIONS ON THE GAUGES AND NEARLY FULL FUEL LEVELS IN THE TANKS. I CALCULATED THAT AT A FUEL BURN OF 5.5 GPH AND 21.5 GALLONS OF USABLE FUEL WE HAD ABOUT 3 HRS 54 MINS ENDURANCE. THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO STAY UP UNTIL XD15 WITH A 30 MIN RESERVE. THE 25 MINS OF HOLDING OVER MRB WOULD HAVE REDUCED THAT ENDURANCE TIME. AT ABOUT XC50 WHILE ABOUT 20 NM FROM HEF; THE ENG MOMENTARILY SPUTTERED AND I DECIDED TO MAKE A PRECAUTIONARY LNDG IN AN OPEN FIELD; SUSPECTING AN IMPENDING FUEL STARVATION. ON LNDG; WE CHKED THE FUEL LEVEL AND FOUND SMALL AMOUNTS OF FUEL REMAINING IN EACH TANK.

I RENTED A C150 FROM THE LCL FBO WHERE I RECEIVED MY PVT PLT'S LICENSE FROM. I DID A THOROUGH PREFLT AND FOUND THE ACFT TO BE AIRWORTHY. THERE WAS SOME LIGHT FROST ON THE WINGS AND SURFACES AND I BRUSHED THEM DOWN VERY THOROUGHLY WITH A BROOM TO REMOVE AS MUCH AS I COULD. I STARTED THE PLANE; TAXIED TO RWY 15 AND DID A RUN-UP. THE TWR CLRED ME TO TAKE OFF AND I APPLIED FULL PWR AND BEGAN MY TKOF. 1/2 WAY DOWN THE RWY AND PAST VR; THE PLANE JUST DIDN'T 'FEEL' LIKE IT WAS DEVELOPING ENOUGH LIFT AND I ABORTED THE TKOF. UNFORTUNATELY; THE RWY WAS COVERED IN PATCHY ICE AND BRAKING WAS POOR. I SUBSEQUENTLY WAS UNABLE TO STOP IN TIME AND SLID OFF THE END OF THE RWY; DESPITE HAVING PLENTY OF RWY TO STOP IN UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES. MY ANALYSIS OF THE INCIDENT HAS LED ME TO A NUMBER OF CONCLUSIONS: 1) HAVING ALWAYS HAD WING COVERS ON ACFT I'D FLOWN PREVIOUSLY; I WAS A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE FROST ON THE WINGS. I BRUSHED IT VERY WELL BUT IT WAS STILL A CONCERN IN THE BACK OF MY MIND. 2) I HADN'T FLOWN A C150 IN ABOUT 2 MONTHS. I HAD BEEN FLYING C172'S WHILE WORKING ON MY INST RATING; SO I WAS NOT TOTALLY USED TO FLYING IT; BUT I FELT COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO MAKE THE FLT. 3) I CHOSE RWY 15; WHICH IS 2600 FT LONG; INSTEAD OF RWY 6; WHICH IS 4000 FT LONG; OUT OF HABIT BECAUSE IT IS CLOSER TO THE FBO AND THE ONE I USED MOST OF THE TIME IN PREVIOUS FLTS. 4) I STILL QUESTION WHETHER MY DECISION TO ABORT WAS THE CORRECT CHOICE. WHILE THE PLANE DIDN'T 'FEEL' LIKE IT WAS GOING TO LIFT OFF SOON; I MAY NOT HAVE PULLED BACK FAR ENOUGH ON THE YOKE. THE FROST I HAD BRUSHED DOWN SO WELL WAS STILL A CONCERN TO ME AND AS SOON AS I 'FELT' LIKE THE PLANE WASN'T GOING TO FLY; I DECIDED TO ABORT. OTHER PLTS WHO SAW THE PLANE AFTERWARDS SAID THAT I SHOULD HAVE HAD NO PROB DEVELOPING LIFT WITH HOW WELL THE WINGS HAD BEEN BRUSHED. IF I HAD TAKEN THE LONGER RWY; I WOULDN'T HAVE FELT THE URGENCY TO ABORT WITH THE EXTRA RWY AHEAD OF ME AND MIGHT HAVE TAKEN OFF JUST FINE. BUT THEN AGAIN; I MIGHT NOT HAVE; AND I DIDN'T WANT TO HIT THE END OF THE RWY GOING FAST. MY COMFORT WITH THE ACFT AND HABIT OF USING THE RWY I CHOSE ALONG WITH MY APPREHENSION OF HAVING ANY KIND OF FROST ON THE WING AND LACK OF RECENT TIME IN THE MODEL OF PLANE WERE ALL CONTRIBUTING FACTORS. I HAVE CERTAINLY LEARNED A LOT FROM THIS EXPERIENCE. I WILL ALWAYS TAKE THE LONGEST RWY AVAILABLE FROM NOW ON; AND IF I AM APPREHENSIVE ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THE FROST; I WILL EITHER CONSULT OTHERS ABOUT MY CONCERNS; OR CANCEL THE FLT. I WILL ALSO BE MORE VIGILANT ABOUT BEING COMPLACENT AND DOING THINGS OUT OF HABIT RATHER THAN STOPPING AND THINKING THEM THROUGH.",,,,"A C150 PLT GOES OFF THE END OF A 2600 FT RWY ON A FROSTY DAY AFTER PURPORTING TO HAVE REMOVED FROST FROM WINGS DURING PREFLT.

I HAD LANDED ON RWY 14 A FEW TIMES BEFORE WITH MY INSTRUCTOR; BUT THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME TAKING OFF FROM THIS RWY. RWY 2/20; WHICH I WAS MOST FAMILIAR WITH; IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION. MY FIRST MISTAKE WAS NOT GOING ALL THE WAY TO THE BEGINNING OF RWY 14. INSTEAD I TURNED L AT TXWY H FOR AN INTXN TKOF. I HELD SHORT OF RWY 14 AND COMPLETED MY RUN-UP. GND CTL ASKED; 'WERE YOU WANTING THIS INTXN FOR DEP?' I ASKED IF THAT WOULD BE OK; AND THE REPLY WAS; 'THERE WILL BE A WAKE TURB DELAY FROM THE JET THAT WILL DEPART FROM THE END; UNLESS YOU ARE READY TO GO NOW.' I REPLIED; 'I AM READY TO GO NOW.' MY SECOND MISTAKE AS A STUDENT PLT WAS THAT I SHOULD HAVE JUST BEEN PATIENT AND WAITED. GND REPLIED; 'HOLD SHORT; TWR NOW 119.9.' I SOMEHOW MISSED THE 'HOLD SHORT;' DIDN'T READ IT BACK AND IN MY MIND I THOUGHT SHE SAID; 'CLRED NOW.' TO BE HONEST; THINGS HAPPENED FAST AND I CLRLY MISUNDERSTOOD. AT THE MOMENT IT DIDN'T REGISTER IN MY MIND THAT I NEEDED TO CONTACT TWR. IT HAPPENED SO QUICKLY. GND DID NOT CORRECT MY READBACK WITHOUT THE 'HOLD SHORT;' AND IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT; I WAS FULLY THINKING I HAD CLRNC AND NEEDED TO GET OUT OF THEIR HAIR. IN RETROSPECT; MISTAKE #3 WAS THAT I CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE ASKED FOR CLARIFICATION WHEN I WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE WHAT I WAS TO DO. I LOOKED FOR TFC AND THINKING I WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING; PULLED OUT. GND THEN CAME BACK AND ASKED; 'ACFT X ARE YOU ON GND?' SURE ENOUGH I WAS; SO I REPLIED; 'SORRY; I AM ON GND.' 'CESSNA X YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ON TWR; I SEE YOU ARE ON THE RWY; CLRED FOR TKOF RWY 14.' AT THAT POINT I HIT MY FREQ CHANGE BUTTON TO TWR 119.9 AND TOOK OFF. TWR ASKED ME TO TAKE A HDG OF 240 DEGS; WHICH I DID. THE NEXT FEW HRS OF COM AND PRACTICE WENT WELL. I HONESTLY DID NOT REALIZE THE EXTENT OF MY MISTAKE OF TOTALLY LEAVING TWR OUT OF THE LOOP UNTIL I RETURNED AND DISCUSSED MY ACTIONS WITH MY INSTRUCTOR AND THEN LISTENED TO THE TAPED RECORDING FROM GND CTL. I'VE PLAYED IT ALL OVER IN MY MIND COUNTLESS TIMES IN THE PAST FEW DAYS. THINKING ABOUT THE LIVES OF OTHERS AND MY OWN AND HOW VERY FORTUNATE I AM THAT NO ONE WAS HURT AND THAT THERE WAS NO COLLISION. I HAVE HAD A DREAM OF BECOMING A GOOD PLT SINCE I WAS A CHILD. NOW THAT THE OPPORTUNITY HAS FINALLY ARRIVED; MY PASSION FOR LEARNING SINCE THE FIRST OF THE YR AND MY EAGERNESS TO GAIN EXPERIENCE AND BECOME A GOOD PLT HAS ONLY INCREASED. I ASSURE YOU THAT AS A RESULT OF THESE MISTAKES; I HAVE LEARNED SOME VERY VALUABLE LESSONS. I AM CONFIDENT WHAT I HAVE LEARNED WILL NO DOUBT MAKE ME A MORE CAUTIOUS AND DILIGENT PLT IN THE FUTURE.",,,,"RWY INCURSION OF AN OCCUPIED RWY BY A STUDENT PLT IN A C150 AT SGF; MO.",

I APPLIED FULL CARB HEAT AND FULL THROTTLE TRYING TO MAINTAIN LEVEL FLT. AFTER A COUPLE MINS AND NO IMPROVEMENT; I THOUGHT I SHOULD LEAN THE MIXTURE FURTHER TO COMPENSATE FOR THE CARB HEAT. (I HAD ALREADY LEANED FOR CRUISE.) WHEN EVEN THE SLIGHTEST ADDITIONAL LEANING CAUSED THE ENG TO CUT OUT; I WENT TO FULL RICH. THE ENG WAS STILL RUNNING (THOUGH VERY ROUGH); BUT NOT DEVELOPING ENOUGH PWR TO MAINTAIN ALT. HAVING TRIED EVERYTHING ELSE; I PUSHED THE CARB HEAT IN (TO FULL COLD). AT THIS POINT; THE ENG QUIT ALTOGETHER. I RETURNED THE CARB HEAT TO FULL HOT; PUSHED THE NOSE DOWN AND THE ENG STARTED RUNNING AGAIN; STILL AT LESS THAN NORMAL PWR AND VERY ROUGH. I WAS ON A VFR FLT PLAN AND HAD ASKED AUGUSTA APCH FOR RADAR TA'S. THEY HAD GIVEN ME A XPONDER CODE AND RADAR VECTORS. I WAS WITHIN THEIR TRSA; BUT WELL AWAY FROM THEIR CLASS D AREA. SINCE I WAS ON THEIR FREQ WHEN THE ENG PROB OCCURRED; I DECLARED AN EMER. THE CTLR OFFERED ME A CHOICE OF BUSH FIELD (CTLED) AND DANIEL FIELD (UNCTLED). I HAD NEVER LANDED AT EITHER AND THERE WERE A COUPLE OF EXCHANGES ON THE RADIO (DURING WHICH I CONFUSED THE 2 NAMES) BEFORE I REALIZED THAT I SHOULD LAND AT DANIEL WHICH WAS THE ARPT THAT I HAD IN SIGHT AT THE TIME. ONCE I WAS COMMITTED TO DANIEL FIELD; THE CTLR SAID THE USUAL; 'RADAR SVC TERMINATED; FREQ CHANGE APPROVED; SQUAWK VFR.' ON THE WAY DOWN; WHEN I HAD THE ARPT MADE; I PULLED THE THROTTLE BACK TO IDLE; IT SEEMED SMOOTHER; BUT THEN IT WAS AT IDLE. I MADE A NORMAL LNDG. AFTER LNDG; I CUT OFF THE CARB HEAT (OUT OF HABIT) AND ADDED PWR TO TAXI. NO PROB. ONCE STOPPED; I DID A RUN-UP WHICH WAS TOTALLY NORMAL. IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THE INTAKE AIR FILTER MIGHT HAVE ICED OVER; BUT THE AIR WAS CLR AND WELL ABOVE FREEZING; EVEN AT 6500 FT. THERE WAS A FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE SHOP AT DANIEL FIELD. (I HAD NEVER LANDED AT THAT ARPT BEFORE.) APPARENTLY; ATC HAD TOLD THEM TO EXPECT ME. THEY WERE ABLE TO PUT A MECH ON IT RIGHT AWAY. HE DID A GND RUN-UP AND FOUND NO PROB. HE THEN CHKED IT OVER VISUALLY PRETTY THOROUGHLY. HE CHKED THE FILTER AND REMOVED IT TO INSPECT THE AIR BOX. ALL WAS OK. FINALLY; HE DECIDED THAT ONE OF THE INTAKE PIPES WAS NOT LINED UP PROPERLY AND THAT IT HAD PROBABLY BEEN LEAKING. HE REMOVED THE PIPE AND REPLACED IT; PROPERLY ALIGNED. AFTER THE REPAIR; EVERYTHING CHKED OUT OK (AS IT HAD BEFORE THE REPAIR). HAVING SIGNED OFF THE REPAIR; HE SENT ME ON MY WAY. INCIDENTALLY; ABOUT 5 MINS AFTER I LANDED; WHILE I WAS DESCRIBING THE PROB TO THE MECH; THE LCL CITY FIRE DEPT SHOWED UP. APPARENTLY; ATC HAD ALSO CALLED THEM.

AFTER THE WEATHER BRIEFING I FILED FOR A S BOUND TFR DEP THEN I LOST THE PHONE CONNECTION WITH JYO. I CALLED BACK TO CONFIRM THEY HAD RECEIVED THE TFR CLRNC REQUEST AND TO FILE THE RETURN TFR REQUEST TO VKX. FOR THE RETURN; I REQUESTED A TFR CLRNC PICKUP OVER 2W5 (MARYLAND AIRPARK) AT XD00 EST. I THEN PHONED POTOMAC APCH CTL AND REQUESTED CLRNC. POTOMAC GAVE US A DISCRETE XPONDER CODE AND A DEP FREQUENCY OF 118.3. WE DEP VKX AT APPROX XB30. THE OTHER PLT; AN FAA AVIATION SAFETY INSPECTOR; AN OWNER OF THE ACFT; FLEW THE OUTBOUND LEG. WE REQUESTED AND RECEIVED VECTORS E TOWARDS OTT VOR FROM POTOMAC APCH CTL AND WERE THEN TRANSFERRED TO BALTIMORE APCH CTL. BALTIMORE ASSIGNED US A NEW XPONDER CODE AND CLBED US TO 3500 FT. WHEN WE RPTED ESN IN SIGHT BALTIMORE INSTRUCTED US TO SQUAWK 1200 AND TERMINATED RADAR SERVICE. AT NO TIME DID POTOMAC ADVISE US TO REMAIN CLR OF THEIR AIRSPACE AS IS THE PROC WHEN LEAVING CLASS B AIRSPACE. WE REMAINED IN THE TFC PATTERN AT ESN FROM APPROX XB50 UNTIL APPROX XC30. WE THEN CLBED TO 2500 FT; ASSURING TO REMAIN BELOW THE CLASS B AIRSPACE; AVOID THE DEPICTED RESTR AIRSPACE AROUND WASHINGTON NATIONAL ARPT (DCA).WE PROC DIRECT TO 2W5 WHILE MONITORING OUR PROGRESS ON GPS. WE WERE STILL SQUAWKING 1200. CROSSING THE CHESAPEAKE BAY SHORELINE WE DESCENDED TO 2600 FT. APPROX 10 MILES FROM 2W5 WE SET IN THE ORIGINAL XPONDER CODE AND PREPARED TO CONTACT POTOMAC APCH CTL. AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE NFP OBSERVED A CUSTOM'S HELI OFF THE L SIDE (I WAS FLYING FROM THE R SEAT)WITH A SIGN INSTRUCTING US TO CONTACT THEM ON 121.5. I COMPLIED. THE CUSTOM'S ACFT THEN ASKED US TO LAND AND I STATED THAT 2W5 WAS ABOUT 5 MILES AHEAD ASKING IF THAT WOULD BE SUITABLE. THE REPLY WAS AFFIRMATIVE AND WE PROCEEDED TO AND LAND 2W5. TWO ARMED CREW MEMBERS MET US AT THE ACFT AFTER LNDG AND STATED THAT WE HAD PENETRATED RESTR AIRSPACE. I SAID THAT WE HAD REMAINED CLR OF THE CLASS B AIRSPACE AND THAT FROM OUR REVIEW OF THE NOTAM; CURRENT COM CHARTS; AND CURRENT VFR TERMINAL AREA CHART BALTIMORE-WASHINGTON (EFFECTIVE FEB/THUR/03; WITH EXPIRATION OF AUG/WED/03); PRIOR TO AND DURING THE FLT THAT WE HAD AVOIDED THE CHARTED RESTR AIRSPACE. ONE AGENT THEN REVIEWED MY PLT CERTIFICATE; MEDICAL AND DRIVERS LICENSE. ANOTHER INTERVIEWED THE NFP. I WAS THEN ASKED TO CALL TSA. I DON'T RECALL THE DISCUSSION EXCEPT THAT TSA ASKED ME TO CALL THE POTOMAC TRACON. POTOMAC STATED THAT I HAD VIOLATED THE ADIZ AND REQUESTED MY PLT INFO AND ADDRESS AND STATED THAT A PLT DEVIATION WOULD BE FORWARDED TO THE FSDO. THE CUSTOMS AGENT THEN STATED THAT WE WERE FREE TO RETURN TO VKX. I CONTACTED PCT APCH REQUESTED AND RECEIVED A CODE AND FREQUENCY OF 125.65 FOR THE RETURN CLRNC TO VKX. WE DEPARTED WITH NO FURTHER PROBS. CHAIN OF EVENTS/CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1) BOTH PLTS REVIEWED CURRENT CHARTS; NOTAM AND RECEIVED WEATHER AND PLT BRIEFING FROM JYO FSS AND DISCUSSED THE FLT. 2) AT NO TIME DID PCT AND BWI APCH CTL INDICATE TO REMAIN CLR OF ANY AIRSPACE WHICH IS THE CASE WHEN LEAVING CLASS B AIRSPACE. 3) NEITHER PLT REALIZED THAT THE NOTAM IN OUR POSSESSION HAD BEEN SUPERSEDED. IN OTHER WORDS THERE AS NO ADVISORY FROM FSS OR APCH CTL THAT SUCH AND SUCH NOTAM HAD BEEN SUPERSEDED BY A NEW NOTAM. FOR EXAMPLE; CURRENT ATIS INFO IS IDENTIFIED BY AN ALPHABET LETTER. THE PLT IS REQUIRED TO TELL ATC THAT THEY HAVE THE ATIS BY ALPHABET CODE. THIS WAY IF A PLT RPTS THE WRONG CODE; ATC KNOWS AND CAN TELL THE PLT THAT IS HAS CHANGED. IF SUCH A PROC WERE IN EFFECT WHEN NOTAMS CHANGED THEM FSS AND APCH WOULD KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THE PLT HAS THE CURRENT NOTAM. 4)FSS DID NOT INDICATE THAT EXTENDED AIRSPACE RESTRS WERE IN EFFECT OR STATE THAT THE RETURN TFR FLT CLRNC COULD NOT BE PICKUP OVER 2W5. 5)NEITHER FSS NOR APCH CTL EMPHASIZED THAT THE AIRSPACE HAD BEEN EXTENDED. 6) FAA DID NOT SEND ANY SPECIAL NOTICES TO AIRMEN AS HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST TO ASSURE THAT ALL PLTS ARE AWARE OF NEW PROCS. 7)THE CURRENT AERONAUTICAL CHARTS DID NOT REFLECT THE 30 NM ADIZ. THE CHART SHOWS A 30 NM MODE C VALE WHICH WAS COMPLIED WITH. 8)THE NOTAM WAS NOT POSTED AS THE FBO. HOW IT WAS DISCOVERED: THE SIT WAS DISCOVERED WHEN THE CUSTOM'S HELI SHOWED A SIGN REQUESTING US TO CONTACT THEM ON 121.5 AND THE SUBSEQUENT DISCUSSION WITH THEM ON THE GND. NOTE: WE DID HAVE A HAND HELD VHF RECEIVER IN THE ACFT SET TO 121.5 BUT NO COMS DIRECTED TO US WERE HEARD ON THE XCEIVER.",,,,"C150 APT PLT; AND FAA AVIATION SAFETY INSPECTOR; COLLECTIVELY WERE UNABLE TO AVOID TRANSGRESSING DC ADIZ.",

INTERCEPTED BY CUSTOMS ON RETURN FROM EASTON; MD TO 2W5 -- PENETRATION OF THE ADIZ WITHOUT PRIOR COM. I WAS NOT THE PIC ON THIS FLT. THE PIC MADE THE CALLS AND GOT THE BRIEFINGS. I WAS PRESENT DURING PREFLT PREPARATIONS; AND I HEARD HIM GET A FULL BRIEFING FROM THE FSS. THERE WAS A 25 MIN HOLD TO GET TO SPEAK WITH A BRIEFER; AND THEN THE CONNECTION WAS BROKEN TOWARD THE END OF THE FLT PLAN FILING. THIS REQUIRED ANOTHER CALL WITH ANOTHER LONG HOLD. WHEN TALKING TO THE BRIEFER; I HEARD PIC ASKED ABOUT THE PROCS FOR GOING FROM VKX; TO EASTON; MD AND RECEIVED AND WROTE DOWN THE SQUAWKS FOR BOTH DIRECTIONS. HE SPECIFICALLY CONFIRMED WITH THE BRIEFER THAT HE WAS TO CALL IN OVER 2W5 TO PICK UP THE CLRNC TO RETURN TO VKX. FOLLOWING THE DISCUSSION; WE SPENT TIME REVIEWING THE OLD PROCS; BECAUSE WE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT THE PROCS WERE THE SAME AS BEFORE 'ORANGE ALERT.' PIC REPEATED WHAT PROCS WE WERE GOING TO FOLLOW TO THE FSS SPECIALIST; WITH FREQUENCIES; AND THEY WERE NOT CORRECTED. THE PROB WAS THAT NO ONE MENTIONED THAT THE REQUIREMENT FOR 2 WAY COMS NOW APPLY AT THE 30 MILE RING. THAT INFO WAS NOT MADE AVAILABLE AT THE ARPT OR THROUGH THE FSS. INFO IS VERY HARD TO FIND ON THE ADIZ. THERE ARE NO POSTED NOTAMS; AND PIC REQUESTED ALL NOTAMS FROM FSS. PRIOR TO THE FLT PIC AND I THOROUGHLY REVIEWED THE LATEST VFR AND IFR CHARTS. THEY WERE VERY MISLEADING; AS THE CURRENT CHARTS ARE INCORRECT. THE COMMERCIAL CHAT PROVIDER DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY DEFINITION OF THE ADIZ; AND THERE IS NOTHING IN THE APCH CHART SECTION. THERE WAS ONE SMALL PICTURE OF THE ADIZ NEXT TO THE TELEPHONE AT THE ARPT; BUT IT HAD NO WRITTEN DESCRIPTION. PRIOR TO GOING TO THE ACFT FOR DEP; I ALSO LOOKED AT BOTH BULLETIN BOARDS AT THE ARPT; AND THERE WERE NO NOTAMS ON THE ADIZ. I NEEDED TO GET A FLT REVIEW; AND PIC WAS GOING TO DO THAT WITH ME. I WAS PLANNING TO FLY THAT WEEKEND IN ORDER TO GET CURRENT. FOLLOWING THE ENGINE RUN-UP; I WENT TO THE MAINT HANGAR WHERE I SAW THE ARPT MGR. I ASKED IF THERE WERE ANY CHANGES IN THE PROCS AS COMPARED TO WHAT THEY WERE BEFORE THE 'ORANGE ALERT.' HE SAID 'NO.' I RECALLED THE PROCESS WHICH WAS TO SIGN IN AT THE OFFICE; CALL FSS AND TRACON; SQUAWK CONTINUOUSLY; CALL AFTER LIFT OFF ETC.; AND I ASKED IF WE CAN DO TOUCH AND GO LNDGS. HE SAID 'NO' AND ADVISED ME OF THE FREQUENCY CHANGE FOR TRACON; WHICH I ALREADY HAD. THESE CONVERSATIONS LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT I HAD ALL THE INFO NECESSARY TO FLY OUT OF THE ARPT SAFELY. HOWEVER; I DID NOT HAVE THE TELEPHONE CONVERSATION MYSELF WITH THE BRIEFER PRIOR TO THE FLT. HAD I MADE THAT CALL; I WOULD HAVE SPECIFICALLY ENQUIRED ABOUT CHANGES; AND FROM WHAT I HEARD; I FELT THAT PIC HAD QUESTIONED PROCS. HAD I BEEN THE PIC; I WOULD HAVE CALLED APCH. I DIALED IN THE FREQUENCIES AND MONITORED THEM (I HAD ONLY ONE COM). PIC WANTED TO SHOW ME WHERE HIS HOUSE WAS LOCATED; AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO WAIT AND CALL OVER 2W5 AS WE TOLD THE BRIEFER WE WOULD DO. HE DIALED IN THE SQUAWK WE WERE GIVEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER DEPARTING EASTON AND MADE A DIRECT LINE TOWARD 2W5. I MONITORED THE CHARTS AND THE LORAN AND AS WE WERE DISCUSSING THE NAMES OF THE TOWNS S OF ANDREWS; CUSTOMS HELI INTERCEPTED US AND WE SPOKE ON 121.5. WE ASKED WHERE THEY WANTED US TO LAND; AND THEY AGREED THAT 2W5 WAS OK. WE LANDED AND THEY TOOK INFO. WE COMPLETED THE FLT TO VKX.

I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION HE WAS A NORTHERLY DEP AND I WANTED TO GIVE HIM PLENTY OF ROOM TO PASS AHEAD OF ME. AS WE LEFT ADDISON'S AIRSPACE; THE CTLR CALLED THE C172 AND TOLD HIM THERE WAS A C150 IN FRONT OF HIM. AS I RECALL; THE PLT SAID; 'HE HAD THE TFC IN SIGHT.'

WE WERE WINGTIP TO WINGTIP. THE OTHER ACFT WAS ALSO BOUNCING IN TURB ABOUT 10 FT UP AND DOWN. THE TURB WAS LIGHT WITH OCCASIONAL MODERATE. THE OTHER ACFT WAS MOVING FROM R TO L AND HE WAS IN A VERY SHALLOW L-HAND TURN MOVING THROUGH ABOUT 350 DEGS AND PULLING AHEAD OF ME. THE WAY ACFT SUDDENLY 'APPEARED SO CLOSE' WAS VERY STARTLING. ALSO; THE WAY HE JUST 'APPEARED' OFF MY L WING; GAVE ME THE IMPRESSION THAT HE CAME DOWN OR BOUNCED DOWN; FROM A SLIGHTLY HIGHER ALT. I COULD SEE THE PERSON IN THE COPLT SEAT; HE WAS LOOKING STRAIGHT AHEAD. THE OTHER ACFT CONTINUED ON SOMEWHAT OF A NW HEADING OVER TO LAKE LEWISVILLE; AND MOVED OUT OF SIGHT. I ABORTED THE TRAINING MISSION AND RETURNED TO MY HOME BASE. AFTER LNDG; I CONTACTED ADDISON TWR BY PHONE AND TOLD THE TWR SUPVR WHAT HAD HAPPENED. THE CAUSE OF THE NEAR MISS WAS THE FAILURE OF THE PLT OF THE OVERTAKING ACFT TO KEEP ME IN SIGHT EVEN AFTER ATC SPECIFICALLY ALERTED HIM TO THE TFC. ANOTHER FACTOR MAY HAVE BEEN CONVECTIVE TURB. IT IS PUZZLING THAT SINCE HE WAS TURNING FROM R TO L; HE POSSIBLY COULD HAVE SEEN ME IN HIS 10 OR 11 O'CLOCK POS BEFORE HE INITIATED HIS TURN.

PIC ALSO REPEATED WHAT PROCS WE WERE GOING TO FOLLOW TO THE FSS SPECIALIST; WITH FREQUENCIES; AND THEY WERE NOT CORRECTED. THE PROB WAS THAT NO ONE MENTIONED THAT THE REQUIREMENT FOR 2 WAY COMS NOW APPLIES AT THE 30 MILE RING. THAT INFO WAS NOT MADE AVAILABLE AT THE ARPT OR THROUGH THE FSS. INFO IS VERY HARD TO FIND ON THE ADIZ. IN FACT AFTER RETURNING FROM THIS MISHAP; I LOOKED ON THE INTERNET FOR 2 HRS BEFORE I FOUND ANY WRITTEN DESCRIPTIONS OF THE NEW ADIZ. THERE ARE NO POSTED NOTAMS AND WE REQUESTED ALL NOTAMS FROM FSS. PRIOR TO THE FLT WE THOROUGHLY REVIEWED THE LATEST VFR AND IFR CHARTS. THEY WERE VERY MISLEADING; AS THE CURRENT CHARTS ARE INCORRECT. THE CHART AID DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY DEFINITION OF THE ADIZ; AND THERE IS NOTHING IN THE APCH CHART SECTION. WE LOOKED SEVERAL PLACES IN THAT PUBLICATION PRIOR TO THIS FLT. THERE WAS ONE SMALL PICTURE OF THE ADIZ NEXT TO THE TELEPHONE AT THE ARPT; BUT IT HAD NO WRITTEN DESCRIPTION. WE DID NOT FIND SATISFACTORY INFO THAT WOULD HAVE PREVENTED WHAT HAPPENED ANYWHERE. PRIOR TO GOING TO THE ACFT FOR DEP; I ALSO LOOKED AT BOTH BULLETIN BOARDS AT THE ARPT; AND THERE WERE NO NOTAMS ON THE ADIZ. NONE OF THE MANAGEMENT STAFF WERE AT THE ARPT; IN FACT THERE WERE VERY FEW PEOPLE ON THE ARPT. WE REVIEWED MY OLD NOTAMS (NOW INCORRECT PROCS) AS I HAD BEEN TOLD BOTH AT THE OFFICE (FLT STANDARDS; FAA) AND BY THE ARPT MGR THAT EVERYTHING WAS BACK AS IT WAS. BACKGROUND: I HAD GONE TO THE ARPT ON A FRIDAY JUST AFTER THE 'ORANGE ALERT' WAS LIFTED. I WENT OUT TO RUN UP THE ACFT AND CHK IT OVER BECAUSE IT HAD NOT BEEN FLOWN SINCE OCTOBER. I NEEDED TO GET A FLT REVIEW; AND PIC WAS GOING TO DO THAT WITH ME. I WAS PLANNING TO FLY THAT WEEKEND WITH PIC IN ORDER TO GET CURRENT (WE MADE THAT FLT WITHIN DAYS AND THIS FLT WAS ONE WEEK LATER). FOLLOWING THE ENGINE RUN-UP; I WENT TO THE MAINT HANGAR WHERE I SAW THE ARPT MGR. WE SPOKE AND I ASKED IF THERE WERE ANY CHANGES IN THE PROCS AS COMPARED TO WHAT THEY WERE BEFORE THE 'ORANGE ALERT.' HE SAID; 'NO.' I RECALLED THE PROCESS WHICH WAS TO SIGN IN AT THE OFFICE; CALL FSS AND TRACON; SQUAWK CONTINUOUSLY; CALL AFTER LIFT OFF ETC.; AND I ASKED IF WE CAN DO TOUCH AND GO LNDGS. HE SAID; 'NO' AND ADVISED ME OF THE FREQ CHANGE FOR TRACON; WHICH I ALREADY HAD. THIS CONVERSATION LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT I HAD ALL OF THE INFO NECESSARY TO FLY OUT OF THE ARPT SAFELY; AND I DID MAKE EXTENSIVE EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT I HAD THE CURRENT INFO. HOWEVER; I DID NOT HAVE THE TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH THE BRIEFER PRIOR TO THE FLT. HAD I MADE THAT CALL; I WOULD HAVE SPECIFICALLY INQUIRED ABOUT CHANGES AND FROM WHAT I HEARD PIC SAY; I FELT THAT HE HAD QUESTIONED ABOUT PROCS. HAD I BEEN THE PIC ON THE RETURN FLT FROM ESN; I WOULD HAVE CALLED APCH. I DIALED IN THE FREQUENCIES AND MONITORED THEM (I HAVE ONLY ONE COM). PIC WANTED TO SHOW ME WHERE HIS HOUSE WAS LOCATED; AND HE INTENDED TO CAREFULLY OBSERVE THE CLASS B AIRSPACE AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO WAIT AND CALL OVER 2W5 AS HE TOLD THE BRIEFER WE WOULD DO. HE DIALED IN THE SQUAWK WE WERE GIVEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER DEPARTING ESN AND MADE A DIRECT LINE; FOLLOWING THE GPS; TOWARD 2W5. I MONITORED THE CHARTS AND THE LORAN AND AS WE WERE DISCUSSING THE NAMES OF THE TOWNS S OF ANDREWS; CUSTOMS HELI INTERCEPTED US AND WE SPOKE WITH THEM ON 121.5. PIC ASKED WHERE THEY WANTED US TO LAND; AND THEY AGREED THAT 2W5 WAS OK. SO WE LANDED AND THEY TOOK PIC'S CERTIFICATE NUMBER; THE ACFT REGISTRATION AND AIRWORTHINESS; AND MY TELEPHONE NUMBERS. THEN WE COMPLETED THE FLT TO VKX UNEVENTFULLY. I RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS THE PIC RESPONSIBILITY TO BE KNOWLEDGEABLE OF THE FLT TO BE CONDUCTED; HOWEVER; THE INFO MUST BE ACCESSIBLE AND CLR. ONE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GO TO MULTIPLE SOURCES TO GET THAT KIND OF INFO.",,,,"C-150 INADVERTENTLY PENETRATED DC ADIZ. INTERCEPTED BY CUSTOMS HELI AND FORCED TO LAND AT 2W5.",

MY CRUISING ALT TO GARDNER MUNI (K34) WAS 3500 FT MSL. I SAW A ROTATING BEACON FROM THE DISTANCE AND THOUGHT IT WAS NEW CENTURY (IXD).

I CONTINUED TO FLY TOWARD THE ROTATING BEACON AND WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE ARPT; I WAS AT 3500 FT MSL. I STARTED CIRCLING THE ARPT AND PROCEEDED TO CLB TO 4000 FT MSL. STILL CIRCLING THE ARPT; I TRIED TO TUNE IN OJC NAV. THE SIGNAL WAS VERY WEAK. I THEN PROCEEDED TO TUNE IN TOP NAV AND THE SIGNAL WAS VERY STRONG.

I PROCEEDED TO FLY TO THE E FROM TOPEKA; KS; WHILE HAVING THE OJC NAV TUNED IN WHICH WAS A VERY WEAK SIGNAL; I CONTACTED ZKC FOR VFR FLT FOLLOWING TO GARDNER MUNI (K34).

THIS FLT WAS CONDUCTED IN DAY VFR CONDITIONS; AND I HAD A SINGLE PAX ON BOARD AT THE TIME. NW OF FFZ; AND OUTSIDE THEIR CLASS D AIRSPACE; I HAD A CLOSE ENCOUNTER WITH OTHER TFC THAT CREATED A SAFETY OF FLT ISSUE. AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT; I HAD CALLED FFZ TWR APPROX 8 MI NW AT 2700 FT TO ADVISE THEM THAT I WOULD BE PASSING SBOUND JUST OUTSIDE THEIR CLASS D AIRSPACE ENRTE TO CHD. THIS TRANSITION WOULD OCCUR UNDER THE 3000 FT FLOOR OF THE PHX CLASS B AIRSPACE; THUS I WAS NOT IN CONTACT WITH PHX APCH AT THE TIME. THE TWR CTLR ON DUTY APPROVED MY TRANSITION REQUEST AT OR ABOVE 2700 FT; AND THEN ADVISED ME OF EBOUND TYPE-UNKNOWN TFC AT THE SAME ALT. I ADVISED THAT I OBSERVED THE EBOUND TFC; AND I ESTIMATED THIS TFC AT AROUND 3 MI DISTANT. THE ACFT TYPE APPEARED TO BE A SINGLE-ENG CESSNA; THUS I ASSUMED HIS AIRSPD TO BE COMPARABLE TO MINE. AT THE TIME OF OBSERVATION; I EXPECTED TO PASS IN FRONT OF THIS TFC AT LEAST 1 MI IN FRONT OF HIM; AND THUS ESTIMATED HIM NOT TO BE A CONFLICT FACTOR. AT THAT TIME; THE OPPOSING TFC ALSO CALLED FFZ TWR; AND IDENTED HIMSELF AS AN EBOUND-TRANSITIONING CESSNA CARAVAN ENRTE TO IWA. HE WOULD HAVE JUST EMERGED FROM THE PHX CLASS B AIRSPACE'S SURFACE -- 10000 FT SEGMENT (ENDING AT DOBSON ROAD); AND WAS PROBABLY JUST RELEASED FROM RADAR CONTACT BY PHX APCH. THE CARAVAN PLT ALSO ADVISED THE FFZ TWR CTLR THAT HE HAD ME IN SIGHT. AT THIS POINT; WE WERE BEGINNING TO RAPIDLY CONVERGE; AND I WAS BEGINNING TO REALIZE THAT THE CARAVAN WAS FAR FASTER THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED; AND SEPARATION WAS A POTENTIAL PROB. HOWEVER; I REALIZED THAT I WAS PRESENTED WITH A SET OF RESTRS THAT MADE AN AVOIDANCE MANEUVER DECISION DIFFICULT: QUICKLY CLBING TO AVOID THE CLOSING TFC WOULD VERY POSSIBLY VIOLATE THE PHOENIX CLASS B 10000-3000 FT SEGMENT WITHOUT CLRNC. SINCE THE RECENT OPENING OF THE THIRD RWY AT PHX; THEIR ARRS OFTEN DSND VERY CLOSE TO THIS 3000 FT FLOOR; SO I DIDN'T WANT TO RISK A CLB. TURNING R TO AVOID THE TFC RISKED VIOLATING THE 10000 FT; SFC PART OF THE CLASS B AIRSPACE. ALSO; I WOULD HAVE HAD TO TURN TOWARDS HIM; AND I WAS NOT CERTAIN THAT THE TURN RADIUS WOULD BE SHORT ENOUGH TO AVOID HEAD-ON CONFLICT. FFZ TWR APPROVED MY TRANSITION AT OR ABOVE 2700 FT. A DSCNT WOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY VIOLATED THIS RESTR (ALTHOUGH I TECHNICALLY WAS NOT IN HIS CLASS D AIRSPACE); AND I WAS NOT CERTAIN THAT THE SPACE BELOW WOULD BE CLR FOR MY USE. I CHOSE TO PROCEED STRAIGHT AHEAD AND HOPE THAT THE CARAVAN PLT WOULD PASS BEHIND ME. HE APPEARED TO DO THIS; AND I WOULD ESTIMATE THAT HE PASSED BEHIND ME BY APPROX 1/2 MI AND SLIGHTLY ABOVE. THE FFZ TWR CTLR ONCE AGAIN ASKED ME IF I HAD THE TFC IN SIGHT; AND I ADVISED THAT IT WAS NO LONGER A FACTOR. IN RETROSPECT; I COULD HAVE DSNDED TO AVOID TFC CONTRARY TO ATC INSTRUCTIONS PER PART 91.123. I DID NOT DO THIS BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTY OF POSSIBLE TFC BELOW. THE AIRSPACE WITHIN WHICH I'VE DESCRIBED THIS INCIDENT IS OFTEN CROWDED; WITH LITTLE OPEN MANEUVERING SPACE FOR TRANSITIONING VFR TFC. ANOTHER OPTION FOR THIS TRANSITION WOULD HAVE BEEN TO OVERFLY FFZ AT 3500 FT. THIS IS NOT A DIRECT ROUTING FOR THE PATH I NEEDED TO FLY; BUT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED ROOM FOR DECISION AND ACTION.

ON MY LAST CIRCUIT OF THE TFC PATTERN; WHILE ON SHORT FINAL (ABOUT 1/2 MI AND 500 FT AGL); WITH THE C172 BEHIND ME ON BASE LEG; I OBSERVED LNDG LIGHTS IN THE DISTANCE. THE LIGHTS APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 3 MI N. TO THIS POINT; I RECEIVED NO COMS FROM THE INBOUND ACFT ON THE CTAF; BUT WAS HEARING THE C172 CLRLY. I RECOGNIZED THE LIGHT PATTERN AS THAT OF A TURBINE ACFT; OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY BASED AT OXC. AS I APCHED THE RWY THRESHOLD I BECAME CONCERNED THAT THE TURBINE TFC WAS GOING TO LAND ON THE OPPOSING RWY 18. UPON TOUCHING DOWN; I MANEUVERED TO THE FAR R SIDE OF THE RWY SHOULD THE JET ACTUALLY LAND. A GAR WAS CONSIDERED; BUT NOT EXECUTED DUE TO MY LOW ALT; THE POSSIBILITY OF WAKE TURB FROM THE TURBINE ACFT AND NUMEROUS HANGARS AND TERRAIN E OF THE RWY. AFTER APPROX 500 FT OF ROLLOUT; I OBSERVED THE TURBINE ACFT MAKING A R TURN TO THE W AT APPROX 800 FT AGL. DURING THE ENTIRE INCIDENT; MY LNDG LIGHTS WERE ON. TO THIS POINT; I HAD NOT HEARD ONE SINGLE RADIO XMISSION FROM THE TURBINE ACFT. I KNOW MY RADIO WAS WORKING BECAUSE I TALKED TO THE TWR GND CTLR 2 TO 3 MINS BEFORE THE TWR CLOSED. I ALSO HEARD THE TWR SIGN OFF. MY ACFT AND THE C172 WERE MAKING THE STANDARD LOCATION CALLS TO AREA TFC FOR NEARLY 30 MINS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT. I BELIEVE THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT TO BE LACK OF COM ON THE PART OF THE TURBINE ACFT AND LACK OF RESPECT TO UNDERSTANDING OXC PROCS. ANOTHER POSSIBLE EXPLANATION COULD BE AN APCH TO OXC WAS BEGUN WHILE INTENDING TO LAND ELSEWHERE. WHILE SECURING MY PLANE; I WAS VERY IRRITATED WITH THE FACT THAT TURBINE ACFT BASED AT OXC HAVE DONE THIS IN THE PAST. TO ADD INSULT; ANOTHER TURBINE ACFT DEPARTED RWY 18 AGAINST THE CALM WIND PROCS THAT ALSO HAPPEN TO BE THERE FOR NOISE ABATEMENT. GUESS WHO GETS THE ANGRY NEIGHBORS CALLING? HINT: NOT THE JET JOCKEYS. AT THIS POINT; I WAS REALLY AGGRAVATED AND OBTAINED THE REGISTRATION NUMBERS OF BOTH THE INCIDENT AND DEPARTING ACFT. THE SUSPECT ACFT LANDED APPROX 10 MINS AFTER TURNING W. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN OPERATING CTL TWR HAS ELIMINATED MANY OF THESE INCIDENTS; BUT IS OF NO USE AFTER HRS.

STUDENT PROCEEDED TO THE ARPT AS DIRECTED AND RPTED TO TWR WHEN SHE WAS ESTABLISHED ON L DOWNWIND RWY 17. ARDMORE TWR IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED ASKING HER WHERE SHE WAS AND WHY SHE WASN'T ON R DOWNWIND RWY 17. STUDENT STARTLED BY THE URGENCY IN THE CTLR'S VOICE; RESPONDED THAT SHE WAS SORRY AND THAT SHE WAS ON L DOWNWIND FOR RWY 17. SHE POINTED OUT THAT SHE HAD READ BACK THE INSTRUCTIONS PREVIOUSLY AND INDICATED THAT HER UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT SHE WAS IN THE PROPER POS. THE CTLR RESPONDED THAT HE DIDN'T CARE WHAT SHE HAD READ BACK; SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ON R DOWNWIND FOR RWY 17 AND THAT SHE SHOULD BE ON THE W SIDE OF THE FIELD BECAUSE THERE WAS ANOTHER AIRPLANE IN THE AREA. STUDENT COMPLIED AND PROCEEDED TO R DOWNWIND RWY 17. SHE STAYED IN THE TFC PATTERN AND EXECUTED 3 LNDGS AT THE ARPT WITHOUT EVENT.

SHE RPTED THE INCIDENT TO ME UPON HER RETURN; AND I TELEPHONED THE CTLR AT ARDMORE MUNICIPAL ARPT TO CLARIFY THE EVENTS.

(MOST OF STUDENT'S TRAINING HAS BEEN AT AFW AND FTW; 2 ARPTS THAT ARE MUCH BUSIER; AT LEAST WHEN WE'VE CONDUCTED OUR TRAINING; THAN AFW.) I POINTED OUT STUDENT'S VERSION OF THE EVENTS; THAT SHE HAD ACTUALLY READ BACK HIS INSTRUCTIONS AND WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF AN ERROR AT THE TIME; AND THE CTLR ADMITTED THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO RECALL (WITHOUT LISTENING TO THE TAPES) THAT SHE HAD READ BACK HIS INSTRUCTIONS; AND; THAT IF SHE HAD; WHAT SHE READ BACK. AFTER HEARING BOTH SIDES OF THE INCIDENT; I HAVE DRAWN THE CONCLUSION THAT 1 OF 2 THINGS HAPPENED: 1) STUDENT MISUNDERSTOOD THE CTLR AND IMPROPERLY READ BACK THE INSTRUCTIONS. INSTEAD OF 'L' DOWNWIND SHE SHOULD'VE SAID 'R' DOWNWIND. THE CTLR FAILED TO CORRECT HER DURING HER READBACK. OR 2) THE CTLR IMPROPERLY DIRECTED HER TO 'L' DOWNWIND WHEN HE INTENDED HER TO ENTER ON 'R' DOWNWIND AND REALIZED HIS MISTAKE AFTER SHE WAS COMPLYING WITH HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO RPT.",,,,"A STUDENT PLT ON SOLO XCOUNTRY FLT IS CHASTISED BY CTLR AT ADM FOR ALLEGEDLY ENTERING PATTERN INCORRECTLY.",

I THOUGHT MY EYES WERE MUCH BETTER THAN ATC. I WAS VERY WRONG. I NOW KNOW THAT I'M NOT ONLY NOT 'BOTHERING' ATC TO HELP ME AROUND THIS AND OTHER TFR'S; IT IS MY DUTY.

ON THE TRIP FROM POMPANO TO MARATHON; I RECEIVED RADAR SVCS FROM MIAMI APCH CTL THROUGH FLL CLASS C AIRSPACE AND THROUGH MIA CLASS B AIRSPACE. WHILE GOING THROUGH FLL CLASS C AIRSPACE; THEY INSTRUCTED ME TO STAY AT OR BELOW 500 FT ALONG THE SHORELINE. THIS MADE ME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SINCE THERE WAS A LOT OF OTHER TFC AT OR BELOW 500 FT ALONG THE SHORELINE (BANNER TWRS; OTHER VFR TRANSITIONS); AND BEING THAT LOW REALLY LIMITS ANY OPTIONS IN CASE OF AN EMER. HOWEVER; I PROCEEDED THROUGH WITHOUT INCIDENT ALL THE WAY TO MARATHON AND LANDED SAFELY. ON THE RETURN TRIP BACK TO POMPANO; I DECIDED I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT AGAIN; SO I PLANNED ON OVERFLYING MIA CLASS B AT 7500 FT (MIA CLASS B CEILING IS 7000 FT); DSNDING DOWN TO 5500 FT WHEN OVER FLL CLASS C (FLL CLASS C CEILING IS 4000 FT) AND CONTACTING MIA APCH FOR A CLRNC TO DSND FURTHER INTO POMPANO. I PROCEEDED AS PLANNED; OVERFLEW MIA AT 7500 FT; CONTINUED FLYING N UNTIL I THOUGHT I WAS ABOUT 1 MI N OF NORTH PERRY AND CLR OF MIA CLASS B. TURNS OUT I HAD IDENTED THE WRONG ARPT; AND I WAS ONLY ABOUT 1 MI N OF OPA LOCKA AND STILL IN CLASS B. I DSNDED AS PLANNED TO 5500 FT AND CONTACTED MIA APCH FOR A CLRNC TO DSND FURTHER THROUGH FLL CLASS C AIRSPACE. THEY THEN ADVISED ME THAT I WAS STILL IN CLASS B AIRSPACE AND GAVE ME A PHONE NUMBER FOR ME TO CALL ONCE I LANDED. I RECEIVED RADAR SVCS FROM THERE ON AND PROCEEDED TO POMPANO BEACH WITHOUT INCIDENT. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE PHONE NUMBER AND EXPLAINED TO THE CTLR WHAT HAPPENED AND APOLOGIZED. HE ADVISED ME HOW IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE IF THEY HAD TO DIVERT TFC OR EVEN SCRAMBLE MIL JETS TO INTERCEPT ME. IN THE END; I LEARNED VALUABLE LESSON THAT COULD HAVE BEEN A VERY EXPENSIVE ONE. THE BIGGEST CONTRIBUTING FACTOR HERE WAS MY CONFUSION OF THE MANY ARPTS IN THE MIA AREA AND THINKING I WAS JUST N OF PERRY (AND CLR OF CLASS B); WHEN IN FACT I WAS JUST N OF OPA LOCKA AND STILL IN CLASS B. HOWEVER; ANOTHER FACTOR WAS MY RELUCTANCE TO RECEIVE RADAR SVCS FROM MIA APCH IN FEAR THAT THEY WOULD AGAIN WANT ME AT OR BELOW 500 FT ALONG THE SHORELINE. I AM AN INST RATED PLT AND HAVE NO PROB WITH TALKING TO APCH CTL FOR RADAR SVCS; BUT BEING THIS LOW ALONG THE SHORELINE MAKES ME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE OF ALL THE OTHER TFC IN THAT SAME AREA. THIS RELUCTANCE TO FLY 500 FT ALONG THE SHORELINE IS ALSO DUE TO THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A RECENT MIDAIR COLLISION BTWN POMPANO BEECH AND BOCA RATON ALONG THE SHORELINE A FEW MONTHS AGO. I HAD JUST RECENTLY PURCHASED THIS AIRPLANE I WANTED TO GET MORE EXPERIENCE IN IT BEFORE FLYING ALONG AT 500 FT. CORRECTIVE ACTION HERE WOULD BE TO STRONGLY DISCOURAGE THE PRACTICE OF VECTORING AIRPLANES AT OR BELOW 500 FT ALONG THE SHORELINE. I BELIEVE THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS PRACTICE AND IS JUST ASKING FOR ANOTHER MIDAIR COLLISION ALONG THE SHORELINE. THIS ALSO PUTS THE PEOPLE ON THE BEACH AT RISK BECAUSE IF A PLT EXPERIENCES ENG TROUBLE; HE OR SHE WILL MOST LIKELY ATTEMPT AN EMER LNDG ON THE BEACH WHICH COULD BE A DISASTER FOR A CROWDED BEACH.",,,,"C150 PLT RELUCTANT TO FLY AT 500 FT ALONG THE MIAMI SHORELINE; ATTEMPTS FLT OVER MIA CLASS B AND INADVERTENTLY ENTERS CLASS B AIRSPACE.",

PREVIOUSLY MEASURED ELEVATION AT MY HOUSE WAS ESTIMATED BY GPS AT ABOUT 2000 FT MSL; WHILE CIRCLING THE AREA MY ALT DID VARY AS PREVIOUSLY STATED; BUT AT NO TIME DID I FEEL THAT MY ALT WAS UNSAFE. AFTER SIGHTSEEING IN THE AREA FOR ABOUT 10 MINS; I THEN OBTAINED THE VGT AWOS INFO AND RPTED MY INTENTION TO LAND WITH THE VGT TWR. I WAS ALREADY AT THE TFC PATTERN ALT OF ABOUT 3000 FT MSL.

IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THE DATE OF THE FLT WAS NEAR THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE 9/11/01 TRAGEDY INVOLVING ACFT; IT HAS OCCURRED TO ME THAT THE PERSON FILING THE COMPLAINT WITH THE FAA MAY HAVE BEEN OVER ZEALOUS OR UNEASY ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF AN ACFT IN THE AREA ON SUCH A TENSE AND TRAGIC ANNIVERSARY DATE.

I CHANGED MY HDG AS INSTRUCTED AND AS I CAME INTO THE PROX OF MY RTE; I SWITCHED MY RADIO TO 122.8 AND CLICKED 3 TIMES TO ACTIVATE THE LIGHTS AT HARVEY YOUNG. AS I FLEW IN THE PROX SEARCHING FOR THE RWY LIGHTS OR BEACON; MY PAX POINTED TO RWY LIGHTS AHEAD AND TO THE L. I CHANGED MY HDG AND PROCEEDED TO LAND; THINKING I WAS AT HARVEY YOUNG. JUST BEFORE SETTING DOWN ON THE RWY; I NOTICED LARGE AIRPLANES AND MORE RWY LIGHTS AND KNEW I WAS AT THE WRONG ARPT. I IMMEDIATELY TAXIED OFF THE ACTIVE AND SWITCHED BACK TO TULSA APCH AND NOTIFIED THEM OF MY LOCATION; WHICH THEY ALREADY KNEW. I WAS GIVEN PROGRESSIVE TAXI INSTRUCTIONS TO TAXI TO J-18 AND DEPARTED TO THE S. AS I BECAME AIRBORNE AGAIN; THE CTLR VECTORED ME OVER THE HARVEY YOUNG ARPT AND STAYED WITH ME UNTIL I WAS OVER HARVEY YOUNG. THE ATC MADE AN ATTEMPT TO CONTACT THE MGR OF HARVEY YOUNG TO REQUEST THAT HE ACTIVATE THE LIGHTS MANUALLY. I WAS THEN INSTRUCTED TO SWITCH TO 122.8 AND CLICKED 3 TIMES TO ACTIVATE THE RWY LIGHTS. (THE CTLR WAS CONCERNED ENOUGH TO SWITCH FREQS WITH ME; TO MAKE SURE THE LIGHTS ACTIVATED.) I DID NOTICE 5 OR 6 SMALL; UNEVENLY SPACED LIGHTS IN A ROW COME ON. THE CTLR TOLD ME THAT THE LIGHTS WERE ONLY ON THE W SIDE OF THE RWY. I WAS ABLE TO LAND AND NOTIFIED ATC THAT I HAD MADE A SAFE LNDG. HE GAVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL AND I DISCUSSED THE SIT WITH AN ATC SUPVR. I CALLED AND GAVE THE GENTLEMAN MY INFO. I BELIEVE THE CAUSE OF THE PROB WAS A COMBINATION OF MY INEXPERIENCE IN FLYING IN CTLED AIRSPACE AND THE LACK OF ADEQUATE LIGHTING AT HARVEY YOUNG. I SINCERELY APOLOGIZED FOR THE INCONVENIENCE MY ACTIONS CAUSED TO THE CTLRS AND OTHER CRAFT IN THE AREA. I ASSURE YOU I LEARNED A GREAT DEAL FROM THIS INCIDENT AND I WILL REVIEW ATC PROCS. BEING BASED OUT OF DUNCAN (DUC); I HAVE LITTLE EXPERIENCE WITH ATC; OR CTLED AIRSPACE. I SHOULD HAVE STAYED ON THE APCH FREQ AND TALKED TO THE CTLR RATHER THAN SWITCHING TO 122.8 TO ACTIVATE THE RWY LIGHTS. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAVE BEEN LOST WHILE FLYING AND HOPEFULLY MY LAST.

HE SAID HE HAD WATCHED US REACH THE PROPER ROTATION SPD AND AS I STARTED TO PULL BACK; HE WENT BACK TO LOOKING INTO THE BOOK. AN EXACT CAUSE WAS NEVER DETERMINED; BUT SOME PROBABLE CAUSES WERE THAT I WAS ON THE BRAKES A BIT DURING TKOF; DIDN'T GIVE ENOUGH BACK PRESSURE OR REACTED TOO QUICKLY.

THE FIRST HALF OF THE FLT WAS UNEVENTFUL; BUT THEN I STARTED TO PICK UP LIGHT RIME ICE.

I BEGAN SPEAKING TO HIM AS MR X WAS NOT PRESENT THAT DAY. I TOLD HIM THE COST OF THE TIE-DOWNS AND HE ASKED ABOUT A MECH; WHO I INFORMED HIM WE HAD 2 VERY COMPETENT INDIVIDUALS; HE THEN ASKED ABOUT FLT INSTRUCTIONS. I TOLD HIM THAT IS WAS THE ONLY PERSON ON THE FIELD AS OF AUG/FRI/03 AS FBO Y WAS LEAVING ON THAT DATE. HE TOOK MY CARD; AND TOLD ME HE WOULD GET IN TOUCH WITH ME IN THE FUTURE. ABOUT 1 MONTH LATER; HE REAPPEARED AT THE ARPT WITH HIS ACFT. HE MADE AN APPOINTMENT; AND CANCELED IT A FEW DAYS LATER. I THOUGHT NOTHING OF THIS AS HIS WIFE MENTIONED HE HAD TO WORK OVERTIME. A FEW WKS LATER; I SAW HIM IN THE FBO; AND HE SAID HE WAS TAKING LESSONS FROM MR Y. I WAS SOMEWHAT RELIEVED; AS I HAD JUST PICKED UP NEW STUDENTS. FRANKLY; I WAS OUT OF TIME AS IT WAS; AND DIDN'T NEED MORE STUDENTS. HE AGAIN APCHED ME TO GIVE HIM A FEW LESSONS. I WENT FLYING WIT HIM; NOTICED HE WAS LACKING A FEW SKILLS IN AN ABILITY TO LISTEN AND PERFORM. EXAMPLE OF THIS WAS TURNING TO A SPECIFIC HDG -- USUALLY THE STUDENT WILL LOOK AT THE DIRECTIONAL GYRO AND DECIDE WHICH DIRECTION TO GO THE SHORTEST DISTANCE. MR X WOULD BEGIN BY TURNING OPPOSITE TO THE DIRECTION HE SHOULD BE GOING AND THEN REALIZE THAT IT WAS THE WRONG DIRECTION AND CORRECT. I PUT HIM UNDER THE HOOD AND TRIED THE SAME EXERCISE; SEEING A SIMILAR PATTERN. I WENT THROUGH THE EMER PROCS; WHICH HE DID NOT HAVE IN PROPER SEQUENCE. WE DID DO THOSE A FEW TIMES UNTIL HE EVENTUALLY GOT IT STRAIGHT. DID SOME SLOW FLT; WITH PWR OFF AND ON STALLS. I TOOK HIM BACK TO THE ARPT FOR LNDGS AND TKOFS. AFTER A FEW HRS OF THESE; I SOLOED HIM IN SEQUENCES OF 3 TOGETHER; ON 3 DIFFERENT OCCASIONS. MY BREAK WITH THE ARPT IS TO GO TO ZZZ1; WHICH IS 22.5 NM AWAY FROM ZZZ. I USE THE METHOD OF ZZZ2 VOR TO GET THE STUDENT AWAY FROM THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY HAVE EXISTED IN FOR THE PAST FEW LESSONS. FROM THERE WE GO TO ZZZ3 USING PILOTAGE AND A NEARBY LAKE AS A SIGHT THAT WILL GET US TO ZZZ1. AFTER A LNDG WE THEN USE THE RADIO REQUIREMENTS; SIGNAGE AT THE ARPT; AND A NORMAL DEP BACK TO ZZZ USING ONLY DEAD RECKONING. THE VOR AT ZZZ2 IS AN EMER IF WE GET LOST OR HAVE A PROB. WHEN THEY GET BACK I GO OVER ALL THE PROCS AND SEND THEM BACK WITH THEIR LOGBOOK SIGNED TO DO THE SAME FLT ON THEIR OWN. I HAD TO DO THIS TWICE WITH MR X AND THEN I RELEASED HIM TO GO ON HIS OWN. HE LEFT THE ARPT AT ZZZ; AND RETURNED 20 MINS LATER SAYING HE COULDN'T SEE VERY WELL BECAUSE THE SUN WAS TOO BRIGHT AND WAS IN HIS DIRECTION OF FLT. ABOUT A WK WENT BY AND HE ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO GO BACK TO ZZZ1 SOLO ON MONDAY. I TOLD HIM HE HAD TO CALL ME AT WORK AND DISCUSS THE WX CONDITIONS BEFORE I WOULD COME OUT TO THE ARPT FOR HIM TO GO ON THE FLT. HE DID SO; AND THE WX WAS IDEAL FOR HIM TO GO AND COME BACK BEFORE DARK (AT LEAST 1 HR IS NEEDED TO DO THIS AND THERE WERE AT LEAST 3 HRS OF LIGHT LEFT). I TOLD HIM I COULDN'T BE OUT TO THE ARPT THAT DAY BEFORE XA30; WHICH WOULD NOT GIVE HIM ENOUGH TIME TO GO OVER AND BACK. WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE ARPT; HE WAS GONE. I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT ANOTHER STUDENT PLT WAS ALSO NOT ACCOUNTED FOR BUT HIS CAR AND PLANE WERE STILL AT THE ARPT. MR Z STAYED AFTER DARK TO SEE IF MR X RETURNED. I HAD A MEETING TO ATTEND; SO I LEFT. MR Z REMAINED UNTIL XC30. MR X DID NOT RETURN. THE NEXT DAY MR Z ASKED HIM WHEN HE GOT BACK; AND HE SAID ABOUT XC45; MR Z ASKED HIM WHICH RWY HE LANDED ON; AND HE REPLIED RWY 21; OF COURSE THE ONE THE WIND WAS FAVORING. MR Z TOLD HIM THAT WE USUALLY USE RWY 3 AT NIGHT TO AVOID THE DEER. I ASKED MR X THAT SAME DAY WHY IT TOOK HIM SO LONG TO GET BACK; HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE AND BACK IN 1 HR. HE SAID HE DECIDED TO TAKE A RIDE OVER TO ZZZ4. HE IS NOT SIGNED OFF TO GO ANY PLACE OTHER THAN ZZZ1 AND ZZZ. I THEN ASKED HIM WHY HE DECIDED TO GO TO ZZZ4 AND HE MENTIONED THAT THIS OTHER FELLOW STUDENT WANTED TO SEE SOMEONE THERE. THAT IS WHEN I ASKED HIM IF HE TOOK HIMALONG WITH HIM IN THE PLANE TO ZZZ1. I THEN MENTIONED TO HIM THAT 'SOLO MEANS BY YOURSELF!' I ALSO WENT INTO THE FARS AND SHOWED HIM THE SECTION THAT MENTIONS THAT A STUDENT PLT IS NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE SOMEONE ALONG FOR A RIDE EVEN IF THE OTHER PERSON IS ANOTHER STUDENT PLT. NOR WAS HE ALLOWED TO FLY HIS PLANE TO ARPTS THAT HE WAS NOT SIGNED OFF TO GO BY HIS FLT INSTRUCTOR. HE SEEMED TO THINK IT WAS FUNNY. I OVERHEARD HIM TELLING SOMEONE ELSE THAT HE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING THAT HE DID THAT WAS SO BAD; I WAS OVERREACTING. I TOLD HIM THAT I WOULD HELP HIM MOVE HIS PLANE TO A FELLOW WHO WAS DOING THE INTERIOR OVER; BUT I COULDN'T DO IT ON SATURDAY BUT ON FRIDAY; DURING THE DAY I WOULD FLY UP TO THE ARPT; RETURN WITH HIM AND SIGN HIM OFF TO TAKE THE PLANE UP BY HIMSELF AND I WOULD FOLLOW HIM UP AND PICK UP AND BRING HIM BACK TO ZZZ. I NEVER SAW HIM OR HEARD FROM HIM THAT WK. ON FRIDAY; HE NEVER SHOWED UP AT THE ARPT. I WAS AWAY FOR THE ENTIRE DAY ON SATURDAY SO ON SUNDAY WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE ARPT I ASKED 'WHAT HAPPENED TO MR X'S PLANE?' I GOT THE ANSWER HE FLEW IT TO THE ARPT WHERE HE WAS HAVING THE REPAIRS DONE. ON DEC/FRI/03; WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE ARPT IN THE AFTERNOON; THE 2 MECHS ASKED ME IF I WAS STILL FLYING WITH MR X; WHICH I REPLIED 'I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM AND I BELIEVE HE FEELS I AM TOO STRICT WITH HIM; AND WILL PROBABLY BE FLYING WITH SOMEONE ELSE.' WELL; THEY BEGAN TO TELL ME ABOUT HIS LNDGS THAT DAY; WHICH AT LEAST 2 WERE SO FAR DOWN THE RWY THAT THEY FEARED HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO STOP IN TIME. I TRIED TO CALL HIM ON HIS CELL PHONE WITH NO LUCK; JUST AN ANSWERING MACHINE. I WANTED TO PUT A NOTE IN HIS LOGBOOK (IF I FLEW WITH HIM AGAIN) TO SAY THAT HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO FLY TO ARPTS WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM HIS INSTRUCTOR UNTIL HE WAS A LICENSED PLT; BUT I WILL PROBABLY NEVER GET THAT CHANCE. I FEEL HE NEEDS TO BE SPOKEN TO BY SOMEONE OTHER THAN MYSELF. I MENTIONED TO HIM WHEN I DRESSED HIM DOWN IN NOVEMBER THAT FLYING IS LIKE A CLUB; THE MEMBERS ALREADY IN IT DON'T WANT TO ADMIT SOMEONE THAT WILL BE DANGEROUS AND BEYOND THE RULES (THINKING THEY WERE MADE FOR EVERYONE ELSE BUT FOR THEM); AND THAT HE NEEDED TO GET WITH THE PROGRAM.

THE FLT WAS A TRAINING FLT IN PREPARATION FOR MY COMMERCIAL CERTIFICATION. I WAS FLYING A C150T WITH 4 HRS OF FUEL ON BOARD. THE WINDS WERE FORECAST 340 DEGS AT 8 KTS AT 6000 FT. BASED ON THIS; I ESTIMATED THAT MY GND SPD WOULD BE 97 MPH AND MY TIME ENRTE WOULD BE 3 HRS. AS I WENT ALONG FROM CHKPOINT TO CHKPOINT; IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT MY GND SPD WAS NOT AS FAST AS ESTIMATED AND THE FLT WAS TAKING LONGER THAN ANTICIPATED. I BEGAN TO BECOME INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT MY FUEL. I DECIDED THAT I WOULD DEVIATE FROM MY FLT PLAN AND LAND AT ZZZ1 TO GET FUEL. AS I APCHED ZZZ1; I CALLED THE FBO AND INQUIRED AS TO WHETHER OR NOT HE HAD FUEL; HE SAID NO. HE TOLD ME THAT THE NEAREST PLACE TO GET FUEL WAS ZZZ2 OR ZZZ3 (I MISUNDERSTOOD HIM TO SAY ZZZ OR ZZZ3). I STILL BELIEVED I HAD ENOUGH FUEL TO GET TO ZZZ AND SINCE IT WAS MY ORIGINAL DEST ANYWAY; I RATIONALIZED THAT I SHOULD SIMPLY CONTINUE ON TO ZZZ. AS I NEARED ZZZ; APPROX 7 MI OUT AT 6500 FT I RAN OUT OF FUEL. I COULD SEE THE ARPT BUT DIDN'T BELIEVE I COULD REACH IT. I SET UP A 65 'NT' GLIDE AND STARTED GOING THROUGH MY CHKS. SINCE I KNEW THAT THE PROB WAS FUEL STARVATION; I ALSO KNEW THAT THERE WAS PRECIOUS LITTLE I COULD DO OTHER THAN TRY TO MAKE THE ARPT AND KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR ALTERNATIVE LNDG SPOTS IN CASE I COULDN'T MAKE THE ARPT. AT 2500 FT IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT I WOULD NOT MAKE THE ARPT SO I HEADED TOWARD A FIELD I HAD PICKED OUT THEN CALLED A PLT I HEARD TALKING ON THE RADIO AND ASKED HIM TO INFORM SOMEONE THAT I WOULD BE GOING DOWN A FEW MI E OF ZZZ ARPT IN A FIELD. THIS ALLOWED ME TO CONCENTRATE ON FLYING THE AIRPLANE. I FLEW TO THE FIELD AND ONCE I KNEW I HAD THE FIELD MADE; I SET UP FOR A SOFT FIELD LNDG. I LANDED IN THE FIELD WITHOUT MISHAP AND ROLLED TO A STOP WITHOUT INJURY TO MYSELF OR DAMAGE TO THE ACFT. I CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE EXTREMELY LUCKY! I GOT OUT OF THE AIRPLANE AND CALLED 911 ON MY CELL PHONE. THE PERSON THAT ANSWERED SAID HE HAD ALREADY HEARD FROM THE OTHER PLT ABOUT THE MISHAP AND THAT SOMEONE WAS ON THE WAY OUT TO CHK ON ME. IN THE MEANTIME; I CALLED MY DEP ARPT TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AND ASK THEM TO CANCEL MY FLT PLAN. SHORTLY A POLICEMAN SHOWED UP AND GOT IN TOUCH WITH THE FBO AT ZZZ WHO CAME OUT WITH ANOTHER PLT TO LOOK THE SIT OVER. WE MEASURED THE FIELD AND DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS PLENTY OF ROOM TO TAKE OFF SO I GOT 10 GALLONS OF FUEL AND TOOK OFF. I FLEW TO ZZZ3; TOPPED OFF THE TANKS AND FLEW HOME WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. IN HINDSIGHT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT I MADE MANY BAD CHOICES ON THIS FLT; THE MOST GLARING OF WHICH WAS NOT TO LAND THE AIRPLANE WHEN I HAD AN ARPT IN SIGHT (ZZZ1) AND I KNEW I WAS LOW ON FUEL. I ALSO REALIZE THAT IF I HAD MADE A BETTER FLT PLAN I WOULD HAVE REALIZED THAT ZZZ1 DIDN'T SELL FUEL. I ALSO REALIZED THAT ON A LONG FLT WHERE FUEL MIGHT BECOME AN ISSUE; IT MIGHT BE WISE TO PLAN FUEL STOPS ON THE LEG HEADING INTO THE WIND. I BELIEVE THIS BECAUSE I RAN OUT OF FUEL ON THE WAY TO ZZZ BUT ON THE RETURN FLT I HAD QUARTER TANKS WHEN I LANDED AT DEP ARPT.",,,,"C150 PLT RAN OUT OF GAS AND MADE AN OFF ARPT FORCED LNDG.",

THE PLANE WAS JUST OUT OF AN EXTENDED ANNUAL AND THE PURPOSE OF THE FLT WAS TO RETURN THE PLANE TO MANASSAS. I DEPARTED HAGERSTOWN ABOUT XA05Z AND DID 2 STOP-AND-GO LNDGS TO CHK OUT ACFT. THE PLANE CHKED OUT FINE AND I STARTED ON MY FLT FROM HGR TO HEF. I HAD PLANNED TO FLY DIRECTLY TO MRB THEN TRACK OUTBOUND ON THE MRB 205 DEG RADIAL UNTIL I INTERSECTED CSN 355 DEG RADIAL; THEN TRACK THAT RADIAL TO CSN VOR AND THEN TURN E TO MANASSAS. I CALLED POTOMAC APCH FOR FLT FOLLOWING AND TO OBTAIN MY ADIZ SQUAWK SHORTLY AFTER DEPARTING THE HAGERSTOWN ARPT AND WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD HAVE TO CALL IN CLOSER TO MANASSAS. THE SNOW THAT HAD BEEN FORECAST TO ARRIVE SEVERAL HRS LATER; ARRIVED SUDDENLY AND MUCH EARLIER THAN FORECASTED AND VISIBILITY TO THE SW AND W BECAME OBSCURED BY SNOW. SINCE IT WAS CLR TO THE E AND S AND THE SNOW WAS COMING FROM THE W; I BELIEVED I COULD SAFELY CONTINUE VFR TO MANASSAS WITHOUT ENCOUNTERING SNOW AND WITHOUT IMPINGING ON THE ADIZ. INSTEAD OF TRACKING DIRECTLY TO THE MRB VOR; I STEERED A COURSE OF 190 DEGS; SLIGHTLY E OF MY PLANNED COURSE TO AVOID THE SNOW AND MAINTAIN VFR. I KNEW FROM MY PREFLT PLANNING; AND CONFIRMED WITH AN INFLT REVIEW OF THE TAC CHART; THAT AS LONG AS I STAYED TO THE W OF THE RIDGE LINE; I WOULD REMAIN CLR OF THE ADIZ. OVER HARPERS FERRY; WV; I CALLED IN AGAIN FOR FLT FOLLOWING AND MY ADIZ SQUAWK AND WAS TOLD THAT MY ALT WAS TOO LOW AND TO CALL IN LATER. BASED ON THE SNOW ENCROACHING FROM THE W AND MY INABILITY TO FOLLOW MY ORIGINAL FLT PLAN; I DECIDED TO FOLLOW THE SHENANDOAH RIVER SBOUND NOTING THAT IT WOULD KEEP ME CLR OF THE ADIZ. JUST S OF HARPER'S FERRY; I SUDDENLY ENCOUNTERED BOTH SNOW (WHICH REDUCED MY FORWARD VISIBILITY TO VFR MINIMUMS) AND MODERATE TURB (WHICH MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BOTH FLY THE AIRPLANE AND KEEP TRACK OF MY POS ON THE CHART). THE WX HAD CLOSED IN BEHIND ME AND A RETURN TO HAGERSTOWN WAS NOT A POSSIBILITY. I WORKED TO FLY THE PLANE THROUGH THE WX WHILE MAINTAINING VFR. THE COMBINATION OF WX CONDITIONS REQUIRED MY FULL ATTN TO MAINTAIN CTL OF THE AIRPLANE AND KEEP THE AIRPLANE ON WHAT I BELIEVED WAS A 190 DEG HDG. AS SOON AS THE TURB SUBSIDED AND I WAS ABLE TO TURN MY ATTN TO THE RADIO; I CALLED IN AGAIN FOR FLT FOLLOWING AND TO OBTAIN MY ADIZ XPONDER CODE. I WAS INSTRUCTED TO IDENT; GIVEN A SQUAWK CODE; AND DIRECTED TO TURN TO A HDG OF 270 DEGS. I WAS THEN INFORMED THAT I NEEDED TO COPY A TELEPHONE NUMBER TO CALL POTOMAC APCH UPON LNDG AT MANASSAS BECAUSE I HAD INADVERTENTLY ENTERED THE ADIZ. WHILE ON A HDG OF 270 DEGS; THE CTLR PERIODICALLY ASKED ME IF I HAD GND CONTACT IN THE SNOW. I RESPONDED THAT I DID HAVE GND VISIBILITY; BUT NOT MUCH ROOM TO ASCEND AND EXTREMELY LIMITED FORWARD VISIBILITY. A SHORT TIME LATER; THE CTLR DIRECTED ME TO TURN S AGAIN AND GAVE ME VECTORS TO HEF. A FEW MINS AFTER TURNING S; I FLEW OUT OF THE AREA OF SNOW INTO GOOD VFR CONDITIONS. I FULLY REGRET THIS TFR INCURSION. I AM BOTH SORRY AND HIGHLY EMBARRASSED BY THE INCIDENT. I HAVE DISCUSSED THIS INCIDENT WITH MY INSTRUCTOR AND WE HAVE SPENT CONSIDERABLE TIME GOING OVER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE FLT AND THE ALTERNATIVES THAT WERE AVAILABLE TO ME AT EACH POINT; INCLUDING DECLARING AN EMER. WHILE I UNDERSTAND EACH OF THEM; AND INDEED WAS AWARE OF EACH OF THEM; THE SELECTION OF ONE OF THE ALTERNATIVES REQUIRED RECOGNITION ON MY PART THAT I WAS IN TROUBLE. UNFORTUNATELY; I WAS NOT AWARE OF THAT DURING THE FLT SINCE I THOUGHT I KNEW WHERE I WAS. MY CONCLUSION IS THAT MY MISTAKE WAS NOT A DISREGARD FOR THE AIRSPACE RESTRS OR EVEN A NAV ERROR. MY MISTAKE WAS NOT REALIZING THAT I WAS STRESSED TO THE POINT WHERE I WAS UNABLE TO PERFORM ALL OF THE NECESSARY FUNCTIONS OF A PIC. WHILE I WAS ABLE TO KEEP THE AIRPLANE UNDER CTL; IN RETROSPECT; IT REQUIRED MORE EFFORT THAN I WAS AWARE OF AT THE TIME AND I WAS APPARENTLY UNABLE TO DEVOTE SUFFICIENT ATTN TO MAINTAINING MY POSITIONAL AWARENESS. I BELIEVE THIS INCIDENT HAS GIVEN ME THE PERSPECTIVE TO PERFORM A BETTER SELF ASSESSMENT OF MY CAPABILITIES AND I CAN STATE WITH ASSURANCE THAT I WILL NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO END UP IN A SIMILAR SIT.",,,,"INEXPERIENCED SINGLE PLT OF C150 ENCOUNTERS SNOW AND REDUCED VISIBILITY CONDITIONS WHILE OPERATING NEAR THE DC ADIZ AND INADVERTENTLY ENTERS THE TFR.",

MY INFO COMES FROM: 1) VISUAL OBSERVATION; 2) TALKING WITH MY STUDENT (WHO WAS SOLOING AT THE TIME); AND 3) TALKING TO A CTLR AFTER THE INCIDENT. STUDENT AND I FLEW FROM EUL TO BOI TO ALLOW STUDENT TO PRACTICE SOLO TKOF AND LNDGS AT A CTLED FIELD. STUDENT AND I HAD FLOWN INTO BOI ON 2 PRIOR OCCASIONS AND PERFORMED TKOF/LNDG OPS WHILE DUAL; AND THE STUDENT HAD DONE WELL. STUDENT FLEW US IN TO BOI AND DROPPED ME OFF AT THE FBO. STUDENT THEN PERFORMED 2 TKOF/LNDGS ON RWY 28R WITH NO TROUBLE. ON THE 3RD LNDG; TWR ASKED HIM TO LAND ON RWY 28L; WHICH HE DID. STUDENT EXITED RWY 28L AT TXWY D; AND HELD SHORT OF RWY 28R. AT THIS POINT A 'STUCK MIKE' SIT OCCURRED WITH ANOTHER ACFT AND STUDENT WAS HAVING TROUBLE COMMUNICATING WITH THE TWR. TWR THEN SHOWED STUDENT A FLASHING GREEN LIGHT AND AS STUDENT STARTED TO TAXI; HE COULD SEE A B737 ON FINAL FOR RWY 28R; HE COULD NOT ACCURATELY JUDGE ITS DISTANCE AND BECAME CONCERNED THAT MAYBE THE LIGHT SIGNAL WAS NOT FOR HIM AND THAT HE WAS GOING TO CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. SO; HE (WISELY IN MY OPINION) STOPPED AND HELD SHORT OF RWY 28R. TWR THEN (ALSO WISELY IN MY OPINION; DUE TO LACK OF 2-WAY COMS) WAS NOT SURE OF STUDENT'S INTENTIONS SO THEY ISSUED A GAR TO THE B737. COMS WERE THEN RESTORED; AND TWR ('STERNLY' ACCORDING TO STUDENT) TOLD STUDENT TO CROSS RWY 28R AND PROCEED TO PARKING. STUDENT WAS QUITE APPREHENSIVE AT THIS POINT; AND TURNED R ONTO RWY 28R THINKING THAT IT WAS THE TXWY. HE REALIZED HIS MISTAKE AS SOON AS HE WAS LINED UP ON THE RWY; AND DECIDED IT WOULD TAKE MORE TIME TO TURN AROUND AND TAXI OFF AT TXWY D. SO; HE CONTINUED AND EXITED AT TXWY C. BY THIS TIME TWR WAS QUITE UPSET; AND STUDENT APOLOGIZED AND REPEATED THAT HE WAS A STUDENT PLT. WHEN STUDENT PARKED; HE EXPLAINED THE SIT TO ME AND I CALLED THE TWR TO TALK OVER WHAT HAD HAPPENED WITH THEM. I FEEL THAT CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WERE: STUDENT PLT INEXPERIENCE; STUCK MIKE SIT ON ARPT; LIGHT SIGNALS; PROX OF LNDG TFC.

THE CTLR RESPONDED 'RPT ENTERING L DOWNWIND RWY 24L.' I HAD BEEN MONITORING THE TWR SINCE 20 NM OUT; AND HEARD A VFR DEP OFF RWY 32; AS WELL AS AT LEAST 2 IFR APCHS -- ONE TO RWY 24R; AND ONE SHORTLY THEREAFTER TO RWY 14. I ALSO HEARD THE CTLR ISSUE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE MISSED APCH PROC TO BOTH. A VFR ARR THEN CALLED FROM THE NW; AND THE CTLR ISSUED TFC INFO FOR THE DEP FROM RWY 32 AS WELL AS THE INBOUND ACFT. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THIS; I HEARD AN ADDITIONAL PRACTICE IFR APCH CALL WHAT I THOUGHT WAS FOR RWY 24L. THIS LED ME TO MISTAKENLY BELIEVE THE ONLY TFC IN MY VICINITY WAS THE RWY 32 DEP THAT WAS TOLD TO TURN TO HDG 270 DEGS; AND A CESSNA I SAW HIGH ABOVE AND IN FRONT OF ME AS I WAS ABOUT 7 MI OUT. I CONTINUED TO SCAN FOR OTHER TFC AND SAW NONE. AT THE 6 MI MARK; THE CTLR CALLED ME TO ASK MY POS AND ALT. I RESPONDED WITH 'ABOUT 6 MI RIGHT OFF THE DEP END RWY 24R AT 2400 FT.' HE THEN ASKED MY INTENTIONS. I REPLIED; 'ENTER L DOWNWIND RWY 24L; S RAMP.' HE REPLIED; 'TURN S AND ENTER L DOWNWIND RWY 24L.' I RESPONDED; 'TURN S; L DOWNWIND RWY 24L.' AS I TURNED TO 180 DEGS; I SAW A WHITE PIPER CROSS R TO L; ABOUT 150 FT IN FRONT OF AND 50 FT BELOW. I INFORMED THE TWR MY TURN S 'ALMOST PUT ME INTO ANOTHER ACFT.' HE REPLIED; 'I HAVE 5 ACFT IN THAT AREA AND CANNOT TELL THE ALT OF ANY OF THEM.' HE ALSO STATED HE THOUGHT I'D BE AT 5 MI 'ABOUT 3 MINS AGO.' I BELIEVE MY INITIAL CALL OF 11 MI WAS UNDERSTOOD AS 7 MI AND THAT I FAILED TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE OTHER ACFT WAS IN RELATION TO ME. I SHOULD HAVE SAID 'ONE-ONE MI' ON MY INITIAL CALL-UP; INSTEAD OF 'ELEVEN MI.' IN ADDITION; SINCE THE ARPT WAS BUSY; I SHOULD NOT HAVE ASKED FOR RWY 24L; BUT INSTEAD ALLOWED THE CTLR TO DIRECT ME. I DON'T BELIEVE I COULD HAVE SEEN THE PIPER AS IT WAS BEHIND ME; TO THE R. IN MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE SIT; I PICTURED THAT ACFT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ARPT. I SHOULD HAVE CLARIFIED THIS WITH THE TWR. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT 3 SIMULTANEOUS PRACTICE APCHS FROM 3 DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS IS UNACCEPTABLE FROM A SAFETY STANDPOINT. AS A VFR PLT; I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE POS RPT OF THE ACFT I NEARLY COLLIDED WITH DUE TO THE RPTING PROC USED ON THE INST APCH.

UPON DRAINING THE WINGS OF FUEL; HE FOUND THAT AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT; THERE WAS 5.0 TO 5.5 GALS REMAINING IN THE TANKS. SINCE THERE ARE 3.5 GALS OF UNUSABLE FUEL; THE ACFT HAD 1.5 TO 2.0 GALS OF USEABLE FUEL REMAINING IN THE TANKS. THIS CONFIRMED THAT THE REASON THE ENG RAN ROUGH WAS POSSIBLY CAUSED BY CARB ICING.

PRIOR TO THIS FLT; BY LANDLINE TELEPHONE; I WAS ISSUED ALL THE REQUIRED INSTRUCTIONS (INCLUDING RADIO FREQ; AND XPONDER CODE).

I ASKED LEESBURG FSS TO CONTACT POTOMAC APCH FOR ME; AND TELL THEM I WAS TRYING TO RAISE THEM. LEESBURG FSS AGREED TO DO THIS FOR ME; BUT THEY ALSO GAVE ME A FEW OTHER FREQS TO TRY.

BEFORE I TRIED ANY OF THE ALTERNATE FREQS THAT LEESBURG FSS SUGGESTED; I RETURNED TO THE FREQ THAT POTOMAC APCH HAD ASSIGNED ME; BUT AN ACR DID.

I TOLD LEESBURG I WOULD CHANGE MY RTE OF FLT SO AS NOT TO CROSS INTO RESTR AIRSPACE; AND I WOULD CLB AFTER I HAD FLOWN AWAY FROM THE AREA. AT THAT POINT I CHANGED COURSE TOWARD THE WSW. FIRST I TRIED ONE FREQ BECAUSE BOTH LEESBURG AND THE ACR FLT HAD SUGGESTED THAT ONE. POTOMAC APCH DID NOT RESPOND. THEN I TRIED A SECOND FREQ AND POTOMAC APCH FINALLY ANSWERED ME. POTOMAC APCH IMMEDIATELY TOLD ME TO CHANGE THE OLD FREQ.

I THOUGHT I WAS COMPLYING WITH THE CLASS C COM REQUIREMENT; BUT SINCE MY FLT FOLLOWING WAS TERMINATED; I WASN'T. AS I APCHED SNA (THINKING THAT I WAS STILL ON FLT FOLLOWING); I EXPECTED TO HEAR SOMETHING LIKE 'SNA 10 MI AHEAD BEARING 180 DEGS; FLT FOLLOWING CANCELED.' WHEN I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING FROM ATC; I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT ME AND RADIOED TO ATC; 'ARPT IN SIGHT.' THE ATC CTLR INFORMED ME THAT HE 'KNEW NOTHING ABOUT ME' AND ASKED 'WHERE ARE YOU?' WHEN I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS ABOUT 5 MI FROM SNA; HE IMMEDIATELY VECTORED ME TO A COMMONLY USED INITIAL APCH POINT FOR SNA. I WAS THEN PASSED ON TO THE SNA TWR AND LANDED. I HAD BEEN ON SOCAL ATC 125.5 UNTIL I WAS ABOUT 20 MI FROM SNA. I CALLED 125.5 TO LET THE CTLR KNOW THAT I INTENDED TO DSND FROM 3500 FT. THE CTLR INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD TRIED TO REACH ME EARLIER TO TERMINATE MY FLT FOLLOWING AND THAT I SHOULD CONTACT SOCAL ATC ON 121.3. I DID SO; STILL 15-25 MI OUT FROM SNA AND HEARD BACK FROM 123.3 'SNA ALTIMETER 29.88.' IN HINDSIGHT; I NOW DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE CTLR WAS ACKNOWLEDGING MY 'SOCAL APCH; I'M WITH YOU AT XXX FT' MESSAGE; BUT THE TIMING WAS SUCH THAT IT CERTAINLY SEEMED LIKE A NORMAL COM EXCHANGE AT THE TIME. SO THERE I WAS; THE PREVIOUS CTLR GAVE ME THE NEW ATC FREQ; AND TOLD ME THAT HE HAD 'TRIED TO TERMINATE MY FLT FOLLOWING;' BUT NEVER ACTUALLY 'TOLD ME' THAT MY FLT FOLLOWING WAS TERMINATED OR TO SQUAWK 1200; HE SIMPLY TOLD ME TO CONTACT THE NEXT CTLR. I CONTINUED SQUAWKING MY ASSIGNED XPONDER CODE AND CALLED THE NEXT CTLR AS I SAID ABOVE. MUCH ATTN HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE REQUIREMENT TO HEAR THE POSITIVE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 'YOU HAVE BEEN CLRED TO CLASS B AIRSPACE.' I DON'T RECALL ANY SUCH EMPHASIS ON CLASS C AIRSPACE. MAYBE THAT WOULD HAVE HELPED. ALSO; WHEN IN CONTACT WITH ATC AND APCHING ANY 'SPECIAL AIRSPACE;' THE DISTINCTION OF TO WHOM ONE SHOULD BE TALKING AT ANY GIVEN POINT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A BIT VAGUE. I HAVE LEARNED FROM THIS EXPERIENCE THAT; AT LEAST IN THE CASE OF CLASS C; ENTERING CLASS C WHILE TALKING TO ATC CTLR ISN'T OK. FINAL NOTE: WHEN I CONTACTED THE SNA TWR; I WAS IMMEDIATELY BERATED AND INFORMED OF ALL OF THE PROBS I HAD CAUSED. INITIALLY BY THE ACTIVE TWR CTLR; THEN AGAIN AFTER PROMPTING FROM ANOTHER CTLR THAT ALSO BROADCASTED OVER THE TWR FREQ WITH 'YEAH! AND TELL HIM A POLICE HELI WAS DISPATCHED TOO!. SO I HEARD THAT ONE TWICE. I SHOULD STUDY MY CHARTS. I WAS NEAR (BUT NOT IN) A TFR AREA. A POLICE INTERCEPT HELI HAD TO BE DISPATCHED. I WAS INSIDE SNA AIRSPACE. AN ACFT ON APCH HAD TO BE DIVERTED. I'M SURE ALL OF THE ABOVE IS TRUE AND FOR THAT I APOLOGIZE. BUT; IN THE INTEREST OF SAFETY; IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO DO ALL OF THAT BERATING AFTER I HAD LANDED AND NOT DURING MY FINAL APCH TO LNDG; WHICH IS KNOWN TO ALREADY BE THE MOST STRESSFUL PHASE OF FLT.

BECAUSE OF THIS; I PLANNED MY RTE OVER NO AIRSPACE AND BROUGHT A HANDHELD RADIO FOR BACKUP. I CHKED THE WX ON INTERNET WEATHER SITE FOR MY ENTIRE RTE JUST PRIOR TO LEAVING FOR THE ARPT. FURTHERMORE; I CALLED NEW YORK FSS FOR AN IN-DEPTH BRIEFING ON THE FIRST LEG OF MY TRIP TO OCEAN CITY BEACH; MD. THE FIRST LEG WAS UNEVENTFUL WITH A REFUELING STOP. THE NEXT LEG IS WHERE I ENCOUNTERED SOME DIFFICULTY. WHILE CHKING THE WX THAT MORNING; I KNEW I WOULD ENCOUNTER SOME MVFR CONDITIONS IN NORTH CAROLINA ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT. HOWEVER; I ALSO KNEW I HAD AROUND 400 MI OF RANGE PLUS RESERVES. THEREFORE; I ELECTED TO CONTINUE THE FLT WITH VFR OVER THE TOP. AS I CONTINUED THE FLT; THE TOPS OF THE STRATUS LAYER BEGAN TO RISE. I DECIDED TO INITIATE A CLB TO MAINTAIN 1000 FT ABOVE THE CLOUD LAYERS. UPON APPLYING FULL PWR; THE ENG COMPLETELY CHOKED. I IMMEDIATELY INITIATED A RESTART PROC (CARB HEAT ON; MIXTURE RICH; THROTTLE FULL AND CYCLE; PRIME THE ENG; ETC). AT FIRST; NOTHING WOULD WORK AND IT JUST WINDMILLED AROUND 1000 RPM. AT THAT POINT I SQUAWKED 7700 AND HIT 'IDENT' TO NOTIFY ATC OF MY INFLT EMER. I CONTINUED MY RESTART PROC AGAIN AS I WAS GETTING CLOSE TO THE CLOUDS. IT SEEMED LIKE THE CARB HEAT WAS STARTING TO WORK AND PWR WAS VERY GRADUALLY COMING BACK (AROUND 1500 RPM). I PRIMED SOME FUEL IN; AND IT BROUGHT IT UP TO ABOUT 2000 OR SO RPM. I WAS BARELY ABLE TO MAINTAIN LEVEL FLT. AT ONE POINT; I FOUND A HOLE IN THE CLOUDS AND TRIED TO CIRCLE DOWN THROUGH IT IN ORDER TO LAND IN A FIELD. HOWEVER; IT REQUIRED A VERY STEEP TURN AND I FEARED LOSING CTL OF THE AIRPLANE. I USED MY HANDHELD GPS TO NAV TO ELIZABETHTOWN; NC; AND CHKED THE AWOS ON MY HANDHELD RADIO. AT THE TIME; IT WAS INDICATING A CEILING OF 1000 FT AGL. DURING THIS TIME; I REQUIRED A LOT OF CONCENTRATION TO MAINTAIN CTL OF THE AIRPLANE AND KEEP IT HEADED TOWARDS ELIZABETHTOWN. A LOT OF THINGS WERE GOING THROUGH MY MIND SUCH AS LOSING THE ATTITUDE INDICATOR IN THE CLOUDS BECAUSE OF A LACK OF SUCTION. IN ADDITION; I WAS CONTINUALLY PRIMING FUEL INTO THE ENG BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO HELP KEEP IT RUNNING. I THOUGHT ABOUT USING THE HANDHELD RADIO TO GIVE A MAYDAY CALL ON 121.5 MHZ. HOWEVER; I DECIDED MY PRIORITY SHOULD BE ON AVIATING AND NAVING (NOT COMMUNICATING). WHILE I WAS DSNDING; THE CARB HEAT EVENTUALLY MELTED AWAY THE ICE AND I REGAINED FULL PWR. I DECIDED TO CONTINUE MY EMER LNDG WITH FULL PWR. I OBTAINED VISUAL ON THE RWY; MADE A QUICK CALL ON THE HANDHELD SAYING; 'ACFT IN DISTRESS ENTERING L BASE RWY 15 AT ELIZABETHTOWN.' I MADE A R 270 DEG TURN TO LOSE ALT AND JOINED THE FINAL APCH COURSE. I LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT.

I SPOKE WITH FAYETTEVILLE APCH AND EXPLAINED THE SIT IN DETAIL. SHE SAID SHE WAS CONCERNED THAT SHE COULD NOT GET A HOLD OF ME ON ANY FREQ TO HELP. I TOLD HER MY PRIORITY WAS TO AVIATE AND NAV AND HAVE AS FEW DISTRS AS POSSIBLE. I ASKED HER IF I SHOULD FILE A RPT AND SHE SAID NO BUT ASKED FOR MY CONTACT INFO IN CASE ANYONE ELSE HAD QUESTIONS. I APOLOGIZED FOR THE SIT AND TOLD HER THAT I HOPED I HAD NOT CREATED ANY TFC CONFLICTS. SHE SAID IT DID NOT AND THAT THEY WERE JUST WORRIED ABOUT ME. I HAVE TAKEN MANY AVIATION SAFETY COURSES IN MY COLLEGIATE CAREER. AS I DSNDED; FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE; I THOUGHT I WOULD BECOME A STATISTIC. HERE IS THE ACCIDENT CHAIN WE SO FREQUENTLY HEAR ABOUT: NO ACFT RADIO; MVFR CONDITIONS PREVAILING; DECISION TO CONTINUE VFR OVER THE TOP; FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR CARB ICING; ENG FAILS AND NOW ITS VFR INTO IMC. IN RETROSPECT; I FEEL I MANAGED THE EMER EFFECTIVELY. HOWEVER; I SHOULD NOT HAVE LET MYSELF GET SUCKERED INTO THAT SIT IN THE FIRST PLACE. I THINK I WAS PUSHING MYSELF TO GET THISFLT DONE (IE; GET THEREITIS). FURTHERMORE; MY PERSONAL MINIMUMS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED BASED ON THE EQUIP I WAS OPERATING (HANDHELD RADIO; HANDHELD GPS; VFR ONLY ACFT; ETC). IN ADDITION; I SHOULD HAVE OBTAINED ANOTHER IN-DEPTH WX BRIEFING FOR MY SECOND LEG. UPON LNDG; I DECIDED TO WAIT FOR THE WX TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE BEFORE GOING ANYWHERE. THE BRIEFER KEPT SAYING MARGINAL CONDITIONS WITH SCATTERED TSTMS FROM EYF TO SSI. I DECIDED I HAD PUSHED IT TOO FAR AND ABORTED THAT TRIP AND TOOK THE AIRPLANE TO TULLAHOMA; TN (THA). THAT WAS WHERE I WAS PLANNING TO GO AFTER SSI IN ORDER TO GET AN ANNUAL INSPECTION.

THERE WERE 2 PEOPLE ON BOARD THE ACFT OF WHICH BOTH OF US ARE PLTS AND OF WHICH BOTH FLEW THE TRIP. I FLEW THE FIRST HALF OF THE TRIP AND THE OTHER PLT FLEW THE OTHER HALF. UPON ARR AT THE DEST ARPT; THE OTHER PLT HANDED THE CTLS OVER TO ME TO MAKE THE LNDG SINCE HE WAS FLYING FROM THE R SEAT. I HAD TOOK OVER THE AIRPLANE ON FINAL APCH APPROX 2 MI FROM THE ARPT ON FINAL APCH FOR RWY 1L AT WICHITA; KS. I FIRST INITIATED CARB HEAT ON THEN STARTED A REDUCTION IN PWR TO DSND FOR THE RWY. AT THAT TIME THE ENG STARTED TO LOSE PWR AND SUBSEQUENTLY DIED. I SET UP FOR A LNDG ON A DIRT ROAD THAT I COULD SEE. THE OTHER PLT SAID HE COULD SEE A CLR FIELD OFF TO HIS R SINCE HE WAS SITTING IN THE R SEAT AND TOOK THE CTLS AT THAT TIME AND LANDED THE AIRPLANE IN THE FIELD UNEVENTFULLY. NO DAMAGE TO THE ACFT; PROPERTY; OR PERSONAL INJURY OCCURRED. THE CAUSE OF ENG FAILURE WAS UNDETERMINED. THE FAA INVESTIGATOR AND MECH LOOKED AT THE AIRPLANE AND COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG AND CAME UP WITH A PROBABLE CAUSE OF POSSIBLE CARB ICING SINCE NO DISCREPANCIES WERE FOUND. THE ONLY THING THE INVESTIGATOR FOUND WAS A FEW DROPLETS OF WATER IN THE R TANK OF WHICH HE SAID WAS NOT NEGLIGIBLE. THERE WAS NO WATER FOUND IN FUEL ON PREFLT SUMPING OF THE TANKS PRIOR TO THE FLT. THERE WAS NO REDUCTION IN RPM'S DURING THE FLT TO SUSPECT CARB ICING FROM BOTH PLTS VIEW. THE FAA ISSUED THE AIRPLANE AS BEING SAFE TO FLY AND WAS FLOWN OUT THAT DAY FROM A ROAD NEARBY. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 629631: ON THE DSCNT HE FIRST PULLED THE CARB HEAT THEN REDUCED PWR FOR THE LNDG PHASE. SHORTLY AFTER; THE ENG SPUTTERED AND THEN QUIT.

THE ACFT OWNER; WHO IS A VERY EXPERIENCED PLT; WAS RIDING IN THE R SEAT. SINCE HE DOESN'T CURRENTLY HAVE A MEDICAL CERTIFICATE; HE LETS ME SIT IN THE L SEAT AND DO THE FLYING. THE PLAN WAS TO FLY FROM A PVT GRASS STRIP TO AN ARPT NEAR SYRACUSE; NY. THERE WAS A LOT OF FOG IN THE AREA THAT MORNING. BUT IT WAS CLR AT THE FIELD. MY COPLT FELT THAT WE COULD TAKE OFF; AND WE WOULD FIND THAT THE FOG WAS SCATTERED WITH LOTS OF OPEN BREAKS. I TENDED TO CONCUR WITH HIM. OUR EXPERIENCE THE PREVIOUS MORNING HAD BEEN LIKE THAT; AND BY THE TIME WE TOOK OFF THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FOG AND JUST A MODERATE AMOUNT OF HAZE. SOON AFTER TKOF WE FOUND THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF FOG. LARGE AREAS OF THE GND WERE COVERED. WE HAD TO STRUGGLE TO IDENT THE SMALL TOWN LOCATED 3 MI FROM THE DEP ARPT. BUT FOR VARIOUS REASONS WE DIDN'T TURN BACK. THE SKY ABOVE THE FOG WAS SMOOTH AND CLR; AND WE COULD SEE SOME BREAKS IN THE FOG IN THE DIRECTION WE INTENDED TO HEAD. SO I TOOK UP A HDG FOR OUR DEST; AND CONTINUED. USUALLY WE USE PILOTAGE TO NAV TO OUR DESTS. BUT WITH THE FOG LAYER I REALIZED THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT TROUBLE KEEPING TRACK OF OUR LOCATION. MY COPLT STARTED TRACKING OUR PROGRESS BY TAKING XBEARINGS OFF OF THE ROCHESTER VOR. SINCE THIS WASN'T ENOUGH TO FULLY DETERMINE OUR LOCATION; I REALIZED THAT WE WERE AT RISK OF VIOLATING THE ROCHESTER CLASS C AIRSPACE. SO I CONTACTED ROCHESTER APCH. FOR A WHILE THERE WAS NO FOG BELOW US; AND WE COULD NAV EASILY. BUT FOR MOST OF THE LAST 30 MI OR SO; WE WERE FLYING OVER A SMOOTH; SOLID LAYER OF FOG THAT TOTALLY OBSCURED THE GND. I STARTED USING VOR XBEARINGS OFF OF BOTH THE SYRACUSE AND ITHACA VORS TO VERIFY OUR POS. ABOUT 10 MI SW OF OUR DEST; WE DID SEE 1 OPEN AREA; WHICH I IDENTED (RIGHT OR WRONG) AS THE CITY OF AUBURN. BUT THAT WAS OUR ONLY CONFIRMATION OF OUR POS. I CONTINUED TO USE THE VOR TO NAV; UNTIL WE HAD ARRIVED AT THE COORDINATES THAT SHOULD HAVE PUT US OVER THE DEST. THERE WAS SOLID FOG; SO WE DIDN'T DSND. WE THEN TURNED AND HEADED BACK TOWARD THE AREA WHERE WE HAD LAST HAD GND CONTACT. AFTER THE FLT; IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I HAVE NEVER CONFIRMED THE ACCURACY OF THE VOR RECEIVER IN THIS AIRPLANE. ALSO; SINCE WE WERE FLYING RATHER LOW; IT IS REASONABLE TO QUESTION THE ACCURACY OF THE SIGNAL WE WERE RECEIVING FROM THE 2 VOR STATIONS I WAS USING. SO THE NET RESULT IS THAT I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW IF WE WERE OVER OUR DEST OR NOT. WE COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN SEVERAL MI TO THE E; IN WHICH CASE WE COULD HAVE VIOLATED THE SYRACUSE CLASS C AIRSPACE. THERE WERE MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING. WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THIS FLT. WE COULD HAVE TURNED BACK AT ANY TIME. BUT ONCE WE TOOK OFF; I JUST KEPT GOING.",,,,"C150 PLTS ON A VFR FLT ENCOUNTER SOLID UNDERCAST AND CONTINUE THE FLT INTO CLASS C AIRSPACE.",

OUR FIRST LNDG THIS DAY WENT EXCELLENT. THEN CAME OUR SECOND APCH AND LNDG. AS WE WERE ON SHORT FINAL; MY STUDENT WAS IN FULL AND COMPLETE CTL OF THE ACFT. WHEN WE WERE ABOUT 40 FT OFF THE GND; WE WENT ABOUT 45 DEGS TO THE RWY. I AND THE R LNDG GEAR WERE OVER THE R SIDE OF THE RWY LIGHTS AND RWY AND MY STUDENT SUDDENLY FROZE AND STOPPED FLYING. AT THIS TIME I SAID 'MY CTLS' AND ATTEMPTED TO GO AROUND. IF I TRIED TO LAND WE WOULD HAVE FLIPPED AND ROLLED OVER A FEW TIMES DUE TO THE SIDE LOADING AND ANGLE TO THE RWY WE WERE AT. AS I EXECUTED THE GAR; THE ACFT STRUCK 1 RWY LIGHT AND THE TAIL DRAGGED ON THE GND FOR ABOUT 30 FT. THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE WE WERE AT A HIGH ANGLE OF ATTACK; LOW AIRSPD; FLAPS WENT TO 30 DEGS AND WE HAD NO LIFT LEFT. SO WE DRAGGED THE TAIL. THE PLANE THEN CLBED TO ABOUT 75-80 FT AND VEERED SHARPLY TO THE L (L TURNING TENDENCIES) ACROSS THE RWY AND INTO A CLOSED/ASPHALT/GRASS RWY. WHEN I NOTICED THE PLANE BANKED SO SHARPLY; I TURNED THE PLANE TO THE R AND LET IT SLAM DOWN ONTO THE GND -- MAIN WHEELS FIRST; THEN NOSE GEAR AND WINGS LEVEL. THERE WAS NO DAMAGE DONE TO THE ACFT AT ALL. WE JUST SHATTERED A RWY EDGE LIGHT. AFTER THE PLANE WAS FIRMLY ON THE GND; I TAXIED BACK TO THE ACTIVE RWY AND PROCEEDED TO THE BASE OF THE TWR TO THE PARKING AREA. I SHUT THE ACFT DOWN AND TALKED TO MY STUDENT ABOUT WHAT HAD JUST HAPPENED AND DID A WALKAROUND OF THE AIRPLANE. THE MORAL OF THE STORY IS THAT MY STUDENT LET THE PLANE FLY HIM; LET THE WINDS GET THE BEST OF HIM; AND HE FROZE ON THE CTLS AT LOW ALTS. YOU CAN NEVER STOP FLYING THAT PLANE UNTIL YOU ARE ON THE GND WITH ALL WHEELS DOWN. FOR ME; I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN OVER THE CTLS EARLIER AND TOLD HIM TO GO AROUND SOONER; BUT LIKE I SAID MY STUDENT WAS IN CTL THE WHOLE TIME UNTIL WE FLARED (TOOK OUT WIND CORRECTION ANGLE) WHICH PUSHED US TO THE R SIDE. THIS TAIL STRIKE HAPPENED SO QUICK THAT I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT WAS HAPPENING. SO BOTTOM LINE IS THAT MY STUDENT AND I ARE OK AND THAT THE PLANE IS NOT DAMAGED.

THIS WOULD PUT US ABOUT 1500 FT AGL FOR OUR FLT UP THE VALLEY; AND ABOUT 1200 FT AGL FOR THE LAST 10 MI. MY PAX POINTED OUT AN AREA OF VERY BRIGHT LIGHTS THAT HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE. AS WE WERE APCHING THE LIGHTED AREA; WE RECOGNIZED THAT IT WAS AN AUTOMOBILE DEALERSHIP. I FLEW OVER THE VILLAGE SO THAT MY PAX COULD GET A GOOD LOOK AT THE DEALERSHIP AND THE VILLAGE. WHILE I WAS OVERFLYING THE VILLAGE; I SPOTTED AN ARPT; WHICH IS LOCATED ABOUT 3 MI W OF THE VILLAGE. I THEN RECALLED THAT THE PATTERN ALT IS 2350 FT MSL. THE ARPT ELEVATION IS 1559 FT. SINCE WE WERE STILL AT 2100 FT MSL; THAT MEANT THAT WE WERE ONLY ABOUT 550 FT AGL ABOVE THE VILLAGE. SINCE THE VILLAGE IS A 'CONGESTED AREA OF A CITY; TOWN OR SETTLEMENT' WE WERE TOO LOW.

I HAD OBSERVED THE WX BEFORE LEAVING HOME AND IT WAS SLOWLY BECOMING CLR VFR -- THERE WAS A LOT OF MORNING FOG AROUND; TYPICAL OF THE AREA. THE PAX WITH ME WAS AN OLD FRIEND OF THE FAMILY WHO WAS A RETIRED AIRLINE PLT. I DECIDED TO DO A THOROUGH PREFLT OF THE ACFT SINCE I ANTICIPATED THAT THE WX WOULD TAKE SOME TIME TO CLR UP. I NOTICED THAT THE TIRES WERE LOW ON AIR AND I HAD LESS THEN 5 QUARTS OF OIL THAT ARE ADVISED ON LONG FLTS. I CALLED THE FBO WHO SENT OUT A CART WITH AN AIR COMPRESSOR AND THE FUEL TRUCK WITH THE FUEL AND OIL I HAD REQUESTED. THE PREFLT WAS ALREADY DONE BY THE TIME THE PEOPLE FROM THE FBO ARRIVED. SINCE THE ACFT HAD FAIRINGS; IT HAD TO BE ROLLED BACK AND FORTH FOR THE TIRE STEMS TO BE EXPOSED FOR FILLING UP THE AIR. IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THIS I INSTALLED A TOWBAR WHICH FIT AROUND THE NOSEWHEEL AND MADE IT EASY FOR ONE PERSON TO STEER AND MOVE THE ACFT. I THEN FILLED UP THE OIL TO THE DESIRED LEVEL AND SUPERVISED THE FUEL TRUCK; MAKING SURE IT WAS THE R FUEL AND THAT THE FUEL CAPS WERE SECURE. ALL THIS WHILE I WAS TALKING TO MY PAX TELLING HIM WHAT WAS GOING ON; SINCE HE WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE GA OPS IN THE UNITED STATES. I THEN DECIDED TO GO TO A NEARBY CLUB TO ASK ABOUT THE PROC TO DEPART RENTON TO THE S AND TO ASK ABOUT THE WX. ON CHKING I FOUND THE WX HAD IMPROVED AND DECIDED TO TAKE OFF. ON RETURNING WE APCHED THE ACFT FROM THE REAR AND BOARDED IT. SINCE WE HAD BEEN GONE ONLY A FEW MINS AND I HAD DONE A THOROUGH PRE-FLT I DID NOT GAR THE AIRPLANE AGAIN. I TAXIED TO THE ACTIVE; DID MY RUN-UP; GOT ASSIGNED A SQUAWK CODE TO TRANSITION THROUGH SEATTLE AIRSPACE AND WAS CLRED FOR TKOF UNEVENTFULLY. I DID NOT NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT OR ANY ODD NOISES DURING TAXI; RUN-UP OR EVEN ON THE TKOF. RENTON TWR APPROVED MY FREQ CHANGE TO SEATAC 'AS SOON AS YOU CROSS S END OF FIELD.' THE FREQ CHANGE WAS MADE AND I ESTABLISHED CONTACT WITH SEATAC TWR. SEATAC ACKNOWLEDGED; ASKED ME TO IDENT AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY CAME BACK SAYING 'RENTON RPTS THAT YOU MAY HAVE TAKEN OFF WITH TOWBAR ATTACHED.' MY FIRST RESPONSE WAS 'OH MY GOD!' SINCE I REALIZED THAT WAS INDEED THE CASE. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED SEATAC BACK ASKING FOR PERMISSION TO SWITCH BACK TO RENTON; WHICH WAS GIVEN. I CONTACTED RENTON AND THEY IMMEDIATELY ASKED IF I NEEDED ASSISTANCE. I SAID TO THEM THAT I WANTED TO MAKE A PRECAUTIONARY LNDG. THEY CLRED ALL TFC AND SAID THAT THE RWY WAS MINE. I DID AN APCH GOING DOWNWIND; AND WAS TALKING CALMLY TO THE CTLR. I COULD HEAR HIM KEEPING TFC AWAY. I SET UP A STABILIZED APCH AND WAS ALMOST TURNING A HIGH FINAL WHEN A MORE EXPERIENCED CTLR SEEMED TO TAKE OVER. HE ASKED ME TO DO A LOW PASS FIRST BY THE TWR TO SEE IF THERE WAS INDEED A TOWBAR HANGING FROM THE ACFT; IT WAS ONLY AT THIS POINT I REALIZED THAT IT COULD BE DANGEROUS TO PEOPLE ON THE GND IF THE TOWBAR FELL OFF. SO I APCHED OVER THE LAKE. THE CTLR GUIDED ME AS I FLEW PAST THE TWR AND ADVISED ME THAT THE TOWBAR WAS ATTACHED AT A 45 DEG ANGLE. IT WAS THEN THAT I REALIZED THAT IT WAS RESTING ON THE FAIRING. I MADE ANOTHER APCH; THIS TIME KEEPING A CLOSE IN DOWNWIND. I LANDED WITH A NOSE HIGH ALT AND KEPT THE NOSEWHEEL OFF THE GND; AS I ROLLED ON THE RWY; THE ROLLOUT WAS NORMAL AND I WAS SLOW ENOUGH TO GENTLY TURN ONTO A TXWY; EVEN THOUGH THE CTLR SAID I COULD STOP ON THE RWY. I STOPPED ON THE TXWY; SECURED THE ACFT. I GOT OUT AND REMOVED THE TOW AND SAW THAT THERE WAS NO OBVIOUS DAMAGE. I STARTED UP THE ACFT AND TAXIED TO PARKING; WHERE I DID A MORE EXTENSIVE CHK OF THE NOSEWHEEL AND SAW THAT IT WAS UNDAMAGED. WE HAD BEEN LUCKY. WE COULD HAVE LANDED WITH THE TOWBAR WITHOUT ANYONE OBSERVING AND HAD A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. THE THINGS I DID WELL WERE: 1) I KEPT CALM AND KEPT FLYING THE ACFT; 2) I COMMUNICATED WITH ATC AND ADVISED THEM OF WHAT I WAS DOING; 3) I DID NICE; STABLE APCHS AND FLEW THE ACFT TO MINIMIZE ANTICIPATED DAMAGE AS PLANNED. THE THINGS I DID NOT DO WELL WERE: 1) I DID NOT ANTICIPATE THE WORST. I DID NOT HAVE THE DOORS OPEN BEFORE LNDG AS SUGGESTED BY THE PLT'S MANUAL AND HADN'T PRACTICED IN MY MIND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE ACFT NOSED OVER; 2) I DID NOT BRIEF THE PAX AS WELL AS I SHOULD HAVE. FORTUNATELY; THIS PAX WAS A PLT. HE WAS ENCOURAGING AND KEPT QUIET AND CALM THROUGHOUT. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE DIFFERENT WITH AN INEXPERIENCED PAX; 3) I DID NOT THINK; UNTIL ATC REMINDED ME; OF DOING A TWR FLYBY TO CONFIRM THE POS OF THE TOWBAR. THE LESSONS LEARNED ARE: 1) NO MATTER HOW THOROUGH YOUR PREFLT IS; YOU CAN EASILY MISS OBVIOUS THINGS. KEEP CHKING AND RECHKING; 2) DO NOT LEAVE ANYTIME BTWN A PREFLT AND TKOF; IT IS EASY TO DO SOMETHING AND FORGET. IF YOU HAVE TO; AT LEAST CHK VITAL ITEMS LIKE TIEDOWNS; TOWBARS AND OBSTRUCTIONS. HAVE A 'LAST DITCH' PREFLT CHKLIST THAT YOU DO EVERY TIME; 3) DO NOT TALK TO ANOTHER PERSON WHILE DOING YOUR CHKS. MAKE SURE YOUR FULL FOCUS IS ON ACTUALLY DOING THE CHKLIST.",,,,"A C150 PVT PLT WITH PAX TAKES OFF WITH HIS TOWBAR STILL ATTACHED AT RNT.",

HE CALLED THE LEESBURG FSS AND FILED ADIZ FLT PLANS BOTH WAYS WITH THE BRIEFER. WE CONTACTED PXT FOR FLT FOLLOWING AFTER LEAVING SBY ON 127.95 AND WERE TOLD TO SQUAWK XXXX. ABOUT 10 MI FROM EASTON; PXT CANCELED RADAR SVC AND TOLD US TO SQUAWK 1200. AT EASTON WE TRIED TO CONTACT POTOMAC APCH ON 133.75 AND HE TOLD US HE COULD NOT READ US CLR; TO STAY CLR OF THE ADIZ AND TRY AGAIN. WE CLBED TO 2800 FT AND CALLED AGAIN. POTOMAC APCH REPLIED THEY COULD HEAR US; WE COULD CONTINUE; AND TO SQUAWK XXXY; AND WE DID. POTOMAC APCH THEN WENT INTO A RANT ABOUT W29 NOT NEEDING AN ADIZ SQUAWK FROM HIM AND THAT NEXT TIME MY STUDENT SHOULD CHK THE NOTAMS. I REALIZED THAT W29 DID NOT NEED AN ADIZ SQUAWK FROM HIM AND THAT '1227' SQUAWK WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH; BUT THE LEESBURG BRIEFER DID NOT OBJECT TO THE FILING AND I WAS TRYING TO GET SOME TRAINING FOR MY STUDENT IN GETTING AN ADIZ SQUAWK AND FLYING IT COMPLETELY SINCE HE WOULD BE FLYING TO HEF SOLO ON A LATER DATE. THIS GOT MY STUDENT NERVOUS AND RATTLED; AND THINKING HE HAD DONE SOMETHING WRONG. ABOUT 5 MI OUT FROM W29 I TOLD HIM TO CALL POTOMAC APCH AND RPT ARPT IN SIGHT AND REQUEST FREQ CHANGE. POTOMAC APCH GRANTED THE FREQ CHANGE BUT DID NOT ADVISE MY STUDENT TO KEEP SQUAWKING THE XXXY UNTIL HE GOT ON THE GND. I WATCHED MY STUDENT CHANGE THE FREQ AND TURNED TO LOOK FOR TFC THAT WAS CALLING AND GETTING READY TO LAND AT W29 AS WELL. AT SOME POINT BTWN ME LOOKING FOR TFC AND LNDG; MY STUDENT SWITCHED THE XPONDER FROM XXXY TO 1200. AFTER LNDG; I WENT TO CHANGE THE XPONDER TO 1200 AND REALIZED IT ALREADY WAS. WE PARKED THE PLANE AT W29 AND WENT INSIDE. POTOMAC HAD CALLED THE FBO AND LEFT A NUMBER FOR US TO CALL. I CALLED AND SPOKE TO A GENTLEMAN ABOUT THE SQUAWK ISSUE. I ASKED MY STUDENT WHEN AND WHY HE CHANGED THE SQUAWK AND HE SAID AFTER WE CHANGED FREQ TO W29 HE CHANGED THE SQUAWK TO 1200. SINCE HE DID NOT HEAR POTOMAC APCH TELL HIM TO STAY ON THAT SQUAWK UNTIL LNDG AND HAD CHIDED HIM ON THE RADIO FOR FILING FOR AN ADIZ SQUAWK FROM HIM INSTEAD OF USING THE '1227' OPTION; HE DID WHAT HE HAD BEEN TRAINED TO DO WHEN CALLING A VISUAL LNDG FROM FLT FOLLOWING. HE SWITCHED FREQ TO W29 AND SQUAWKED 1200. WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS: I WILL DEVELOP A BETTER BRIEF FOR MY STUDENTS WHEN FLYING INTO THE ADIZ; DEVELOPED AROUND THE RULES AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE ADIZ AND ON CREW CONCEPTS. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WHEN MORE THAN 1 PLT IS IN THE PLANE; IF ONE MAKES A CHANGE TO THE EQUIP/PLANE HE TELLS THE OTHER PLT WHAT HE DID. ALSO; APCH HAD NO REASON TO CHIDE MY STUDENT. HE HAD FILED A PROPER ADIZ FLT PLAN WITH AN AUTH BRIEFING AGENCY. IT SEEMS POTOMAC APCH LET FRUSTRATION GET THE BETTER OF THEM AND GOT DISTR BY MY STUDENT REQUESTING A SQUAWK AND FORGOT TO FURTHER ADVISE HIM ABOUT KEEPING THE SQUAWK TILL LNDG. WE NEED TO TRAIN PEOPLE ON HOW TO GET IN AND OUT OF THE ADIZ PROPERLY. WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY I CHOSE TO GO TO W29 WITH MY STUDENT BEFORE I SENT HIM SOLO. UNFORTUNATELY; MOST PEOPLE WILL NOT GO NEAR IT BECAUSE THEY FEAR IT. AND THIS IS UNFORTUNATE THAT FEAR IS USED INSTEAD OF EDUCATION. MOST PLTS DO NOT EVEN WANT TO LEARN HOW TO GET IN AND OUT. I HAVE BEEN IN AND OUT OF THE ADIZ 20+ TIMES VFR AND HAVE NEVER HAD AN INCIDENT. AND THROUGH BETTER COM AND BETTER TRAINING; MORE PLTS WILL BE ABLE TO AS WELL.",,,,"INSTRUCTOR AND STUDENT IN C150 CHANGE XPONDER TO 1200 DURING ARR AT W29 WITHIN THE DC ADIZ.",

GND CLRED ME TO TAXI TO RWY 26. I MONITORED GND THROUGHOUT MY TAXI. I HAD ALSO REVIEWED THE ARPT DIAGRAM BEFORE LEAVING THE RAMP AND DETECTED NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THE LOCATION OF HOLD SHORT LINES AND PROCEEDED TO TAXI E ON TXWY C. LOOKING FAR DOWN TXWY C; I NOTICED NOTHING UNUSUAL AND PROCEEDED TO CROSS INTERSECTING RWY 35. I PROCEEDED TO THE LAST SECTION OF TXWY C TO USE THE FULL LENGTH OF RWY 26 FOR TKOF. I PERFORMED A RUN-UP/PRETKOF CHKLIST AND PROCEEDED TO LOOK FOR THE HOLD SHORT LINE. I SAW NONE BUT STAYED WELL CLR OF THE ACTIVE RWY (RWY 26). AT THIS TIME I FELT SOMETHING WAS WRONG. TO THIS POINT; I HEARD NOTHING ON THE GND FREQ OF 121.6. I SWITCHED TO TWR; 119.4; AND RPTED READY FOR TKOF AND WAS CLRED FOR TKOF ON RWY 26 WITH A W DEP. AS I PROCEEDED TO THE RWY; I WAS INFORMED BY THE TWR THAT I WAS WELL PAST THE HOLD SHORT LINE. I REPLIED THAT I WAS SORRY; BUT I HAD NOT SEEN THE LINE. I LOOKED BACK TO SEE WHERE A FRIEND'S PLANE HAD STOPPED FOR RUN-UP AND IT WAS WELL BACK ON TXWY C. I HAD NEVER SEEN A HOLD SHORT LINE THAT FAR BACK FROM THE RWY AND PLACED ON THE MAIN PART OF A TXWY BEFORE. NOW I WAS UPSET; I OBVIOUSLY TAXIED RIGHT PAST THE SIGNAGE FOR THE HOLD SHORT LINE. I HAVE NO IDEA HOW I COULD HAVE MISSED THE MARKINGS OTHER THAN THE SUN ANGLE MAY HAVE CREATED A GLARE OR A SHADOW. THIS INCURSION WAS PURELY UNINTENTIONAL AND ACCIDENTAL. I PRESENTED NO SAFETY PROB NOR DID I VENTURE ONTO THE ACTIVE RWY. I BELIEVE THAT I MADE THIS ERROR DUE TO THE VERY UNUSUAL LOCATION OF THE HOLD SHORT LINE AND NOT PAYING CLOSE ENOUGH ATTN TO ARPT MARKINGS. SOME OF THIS LACK OF EXTRA VIGILANCE CAME FROM A FALSE SENSE OF 'STANDARD' LAYOUT SINCE NOTHING ON THE ARPT DIAGRAM INDICATED ANYTHING UNUSUAL ABOUT TXWY C. IN THE FUTURE; I WILL MAINTAIN ADDITIONAL VIGILANCE WHILE TAXIING; THOUGH; AT THE TIME I FELT I WAS PREPARED TO TAXI PER REVIEW OF THE TAXI DIAGRAM. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL IF GND CTL WOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING TO ME RIGHT AWAY; AT LEAST I COULD HAVE STOPPED CLOSER TO THE HOLD SHORT LINE. I ALSO FEEL THAT FOR ARPTS LIKE DXR THERE SHOULD BE SPECIAL NOTES AND MARKINGS ON THE TAXI DIAGRAM TO INDICATE THESE NONSTANDARD OR THE UNUSUAL PLACEMENT OF HOLD SHORT LINES. IN APRIL; I FLEW TO FLORIDA AND BACK WITH NOT ONE SINGLE PROB TAXIING AT ARPTS THAT WERE UNFAMILIAR; I ALSO DID NOT SEE HOLD SHORT LINES PLACED LIKE THEY ARE AT DXR. I DO NOT KNOW WHY THEY ARE PLACED THAT WAY BUT THEY SHOULD BE MOVED TO A LOCATION LIKE THE MIDDLE OF C4.

AT THAT TIME I TURNED 180 DEGS INTO THE WIND WHILE PUTTING A DIRECT TO ZZZ1 ARPT. I WAS TUNED ON THE ZZZ1 VOR AND CTRED THE NEEDLE SO AS TO NOT DRIFT MY COURSE. I THEN CHKED BOTH MAGNETOS AND ENG OIL PRESSURE/TEMP; ALL OF WHICH WERE NORMAL. I WAS OVER ROLLING HILLS AND KNEW I WASN'T GOING TO MAKE THE ARPT. AS I PASSED THROUGH 2500 FT; I TUNED MY XPONDER TO 7700 AND BEGAN MAKING MAYDAY CALLS ON 121.5. AS I DSNDED; NOBODY RESPONDED; SO I TUNED THE RADIO TO 122.8 (THE CTAF FOR BOTH ZZZ1 AND NEARBY ZZZ2). I HEARD TFC IN THE PATTERN AT ZZZ2. I XMITTED MY MAYDAY AS WELL AS MY LATITUDE/LONGITUDE OFF MY GPS. NOBODY RESPONDED AGAIN. AS I PASSED THROUGH 1700 FT MSL; I SAW A SMALL SET OF TELEPHONE LINES IN MY ORIGINAL LNDG AREA. WITH PARTIAL PWR APPLIED; I WAS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN MY ALT; BUT COULD REDUCE MY RATE OF DSCNT. I DROPPED 10 DEGS OF FLAPS TO GAIN LIFT AND BANKED HARD AT ABOUT 300 FT. I CROSSED A HEDGEROW OF 80 FT TREES; KNOWING I WOULD MAKE MY LNDG AREA DROPPED FULL FLAPS TO GET DOWN; BECAUSE SLIPPING THE ACFT INTO THE FIELD WOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED ME TO LINE UP WITH THE ROWS IN THE FIELD MADE BY THE OWNER'S TRACTOR.

I APPLIED FULL BRAKE PRESSURE AFTER THE NOSE SETTLED. THE ACFT WAS LANDED WITH ABOUT 75 FT OF GND RUN AND NO DAMAGE. THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE IS BELIEVED TO BE A DROPPED CYLINDER OR VALVE.

THE BRIEFER STATED THAT THE WX WOULD BE MVFR THROUGH MY INTENDED COURSE; WITH A BIT OF IFR NEAR ZZZ2 AND THEN MVFR AFTER THAT. THE WX AT ZZZ1 APPEARED BETTER THAN THE INFO THAT THE BRIEFER HAD; AND ZZZ2 IS LOCATED ON TOP OF A MOUNTAIN 3700+ FT MSL; SO I FIGURED THAT IMC AT ZZZ2 MEANT THAT THE CLOUD BASES WERE ABOUT THE SAME AS THEY WERE AT ZZZ1. THIS WAS A MISTAKE. I DEPARTED FROM ZZZ1 AND CLBED THROUGH THE BROKEN CLOUD LAYER. THE CLOUD BASES WERE AROUND 4000 FT AND THE TOPS WERE AROUND 6500 FT. I CLBED TO 6500 FT AND THEN UP TO 7500 FT. THE BROKEN CLOUD LAYER SOON TURNED TO AN UNDERCAST; BUT SINCE THE WX WAS SUPPOSED TO GET WORSE AND THEN GET BETTER; I CONTINUED TO FLY MY COURSE. AFTER I PASSED ZZZ2; THE UNDERCAST STARTED TO RISE. I CLBED TO 9500 FT MSL AS THE UNDERCAST WAS RISING; AND SOON I WAS IN THE CLOUDS. I SHOULD HAVE TURNED BACK; BUT I STARTED FLYING THE ACFT AS PER THE PVT PLT INST TRAINING AND THE IFR FLYING I'VE DONE AS A PLT RATED PAX. SINCE I EXPECTED THE WX TO GET BETTER; I PRESSED ON THINKING THAT THE UNDERCAST WOULD DSND BACK TO THE BROKEN UNDERCAST. I FLEW THIS WAY FOR 10 OR 15 MINS. THIS WAS ANOTHER MISTAKE. SOON; IT BECAME CLR THAT THIS WAS HERE TO STAY. I HAD BEEN MONITORING THE CTAF FREQS FOR NEARBY ARPTS; AND THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF TFC AT ZZZ3. SO; I DSNDED FROM 9500 FT DOWN TO ABOUT 4800 FT; WHICH WAS AT THE HT OF THE HIGHEST OBSTACLE ON THE SECTION OF THE CHART THAT I WAS USING. NO GND CONTACT; SO I STARTED CLBING AND EXECUTED A 180 DEG TURN. A FEW HOLES ALLOWED ME TO SEE SOME WOODED MOUNTAINTOPS BELOW ME; BUT THE HOLES WERE TOO SMALL AND THE TERRAIN TOO RUGGED TO RISK A DSCNT INTO THE VFR CONDITIONS BELOW. THE MOUNTAINTOPS WERE CLOSER THAN I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED -- MAYBE 1000 FT BELOW. I STARTED CLBING BACK UP WITH 8500 FT MSL AS MY GOAL. DSNDING THAT LOW WAS YET ANOTHER MISTAKE. AS I FLEW BACK AND CLBED; THE WX GRADUALLY GOT BETTER UNTIL I WAS VFR ON TOP. LOOKING AHEAD; IT APPEARED THAT THE WX DIDN'T GET MUCH BETTER TOWARD ZZZ1; SO I ELECTED TO FLY TO ZZZ3 INSTEAD AND; IF WORSE CAME TO WORST; HAVE THEM TALK ME THROUGH ONE OF THE INST APCHS. ON THE WAY TO ZZZ3; I FOUND A HOLE IN THE CLOUDS; AND MADE A SPIRALING VFR DSCNT THROUGH THE HOLE. WHEN I POPPED OUT OF THE BOTTOM (ABOUT 3000 FT MSL); I PROCEEDED TO ZZZ3. I CALLED ZZZ3 AND THEY ALLOWED ME TO LAND VFR. THEY DIRECTED ME TO RWY 6; BUT AFTER I MENTIONED THAT I'D BEEN IN AN INADVERTENT IMC; THEY HAD ME FLY STRAIGHT-IN TO RWY 24. I THANKED THEM FOR THE PRIORITY. I SAT AT THE FBO AT ZZZ3 FOR ABOUT 3 HRS. I CALLED A FRIEND TO HAVE HER COME AND PICK ME UP; BUT CANCELED AFTER THE WX STARTED IMPROVING. ABOUT XF15; THE WX HAD IMPROVED AND THE ZZZ1 AWOS WAS RPTING VISIBILITY OF 7 MI AND WITH A BROKEN CLOUD LAYER OF 4000 FT AGL. I DEPARTED FOR ZZZ1 AFTER BUMBLING MY WAY THROUGH ZZZ3'S ATC. PART OF IT WAS DUE TO MY NOT HAVING THE ARPT INFO FOR ZZZ3; AND PART OF IT WAS THAT I HAD AN OUT-OF-DATE CHART. MY GPS WAS UP-TO-DATE (LEGAL FOR VFR); BUT IT'S EASIER TO GET RADIO FREQS BY LOOKING AT THE SECTIONAL -- AND I GOT THE OUT-OF-DATE ATIS FREQ. THE FLT TO ZZZ1 WAS UNEVENTFUL -- AT LEAST COMPARED TO THE DEPARTING FLT. I FLEW LOWER THAN I WOULD HAVE NORMALLY; AND BELOW THE MOUNTAINTOPS. THE CTLR WANTED ME TO FLY NW TO MAKE HIS JOB EASIER; BUT I WAS LOW ENOUGH THAT FLYING NW WOULD HAVE PUT ME INTO CONFLICT WITH THE MOUNTAIN. I FLEW ALONG THE MOUNTAIN AS BEST I COULD; AND FOLLOWED THE RAILROAD TRACKS HOME. I DID A NICE SHORT-FIELD LNDG AT ZZZ1; TOO. LESSONS LEARNED/CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN: 1) THE WX IS UNPREDICTABLE AND I'VE REALLY LEARNED MY LIMITS ON THIS ONE. CORRECTIVE ACTION: DON'T DO THIS AGAIN! 2) THE WX SIT CHANGED SLOWLY ENOUGH THAT I COULD GET USED TO EACH CHANGE; ONE AT A TIME. BEFORE TODAY; WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT VFR INTO IMC; I ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT FLYING INTO A VERTICAL WALL OF CLOUD; AND I FIGURED I WAS SMART ENOUGH THAT SUCH A THING WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO ME. BUT; THAT WASN'T HOW IT HAPPENED -- THE TRANSITION HAPPENED OVER A SPAN OF SEVERAL MINS AND HAPPENED GRADUALLY ENOUGH THAT THERE WASN'T ANY SURPRISES BIG ENOUGH TO STARTLE ME INTO TURNING BACK; AND SO I DELAYED MY 180 DEG TURN MUCH LONGER THAN I SHOULD HAVE. 3) GPS -- I HAD A GARMIN 295 HANDHELD GPS. IT WAS A LIFESAVER; PROVIDED GREAT SITUATIONAL AWARENESS; AND A GREAT CHK FOR THE GYRO INSTS IN THE ACFT. HOWEVER; I WOULD HAVE TURNED BACK MUCH EARLIER IF I HADN'T HAD IT. 4) I DIDN'T CALL CTR BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE THEIR FREQ HANDY. I SHOULD HAVE. IN THE FUTURE; I WILL LOOK THIS UP BEFORE I DEPART. 5) I'VE BEEN A LITTLE OVERCONFIDENT LATELY -- I'M CLOSE TO TAKING MY IFR WRITTEN AND I'VE FLOWN ACFT IN IMC; BUT NOT AS PIC. I'VE ALSO SUCCESSFULLY PUSHED THE WX ENVELOPE IN VFR CONDITIONS LATELY; AND IT WAS EASIER THAN EXPECTED. TODAY; I PUSHED TOO FAR. 6) THROW AWAY OUT-OF-DATE CHARTS. JUST BECAUSE THE DATABASE IN THE GPS IS UP-TO-DATE DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE OLD CHART WILL BE CORRECT. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE THAT I NOTICED WAS THE ATIS FREQ AT ZZZ3. THE OUT-OF-DATE CHART THAT I HAD WITH ME IS NOW IN A TRASH CAN AT ZZZ1. 7) AN INST RATING IS NECESSARY FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH I FLY. I'VE CONTACTED MY FAVORITE CFI TO SEE IF HE'S READY TO START INSTRUCTING ME ON THE ART OF INST FLYING; AND I WILL BE VERY EAGER TO ATTEND THE INST GND SCHOOL THAT I HAD SCHEDULED TO ATTEND. 8) I WOULDN'T HAVE ATTEMPTED THIS FLT IF I'D HAD A PAX. THAT SHOULD HAVE GIVEN ME PAUSE. MAYBE I SHOULD CONSIDER MYSELF AS A PAX IN ADDITION TO CONSIDERING MYSELF TO BE PIC? 9) THE MODE C IN THE ACFT I WAS FLYING HAS BEEN AN INTERMITTENT PROB FOR OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CLUB. IT WAS OFF BY 600 FT WHEN I APCHED ZZZ3 (WHEN I ADVISED THEM OF A POTENTIAL PROB) AND WASN'T RPTING DURING MY DEP. JUST BECAUSE THE FLT I PLANNED DIDN'T REQUIRE A MODE C DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE ACTUAL CONDITIONS DIDN'T REQUIRE IT. ALL IN ALL; I'M HAPPY TO BE BACK ON THE GND TODAY. I'M GOING TO GO TO A PICNIC THIS EVENING AND ENJOY THE COMPANY OF MY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. I'VE READ THIS CHAIN OF EVENTS IN MANY ACCIDENT RPTS; AND ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT I WAS TOO SMART FOR IT TO HAPPEN TO ME -- BUT I WASN'T PREPARED FOR THE GRADUAL NATURE OF THE DEVELOPING EMER. WHEN I DSNDED TO THE LEVEL OF THE HIGHEST OBSTACLE ON THE CHART (BELOW THE MEA FOR THE AREA); I WAS PROBABLY ONE MISTAKE AWAY FROM BEING A STATISTIC. THIS IS QUITE SOBERING; AND I PLAN TO BE MORE CAUTIOUS AND BETTER PREPARED (INST RATED) IN THE FUTURE.",,,,"A VFR C150 PLT ENCOUNTERS IMC AND COMPLETES AN UNSCHEDULED LNDG.",

I HAVE NEVER RELIED UPON THE FUEL GAUGES; AS FUEL GAUGES ARE HISTORICALLY INACCURATE. IN FACT; THE R FUEL GAUGE HAS PROGRESSIVELY DETERIORATED SO THAT IT NOW INDICATES 3/4 FULL WHEN EMPTY. IT IF FLAPPED AS INOP. AS THE C150 FUEL CTL IS EITHER ON OR OFF; THE L FUEL GAUGE HAS BECOME THE DE FACTO GAUGE FOR GROSS REF.

(THE ACFT IS EQUIPPED WITH A HOBBS METER; BUT SINCE I HAVE CONSIDERED THE HOBBS AS 'FAT PENCIL TIME;' I DO NOT RECORD FLT TIME FROM IT.) BECAUSE OF RECENT COLD WX IN THE REGION; I HAVE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO LET THE ENG WARM UP ON THE GND FOR PROLONGED PERIODS IN ORDER FOR THE OIL PRESSURE GAUGE TO ENTER THE BOTTOM OF THE GREEN ARC. ON DEC/XX/05; I EMBARKED UPON A FLT FROM MY HOME BASE TO AN ARPT 14 NM DISTANT WHERE SELF-SVC FUEL IS AVAILABLE AND THERE EXISTS A COLLEGIAL ATMOSPHERE OF EXPERIMENTAL ACFT BUILDERS AND 'BARNSTORMER' PLTS. MY FUEL GAUGE INDICATED 1/4 FULL (ABOUT 6 GALLONS) AND THE TACHOMETER TIME USAGE WAS CONSISTENT WITH THAT. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADEQUATE FUEL FOR THE 10 MIN TRIP; WITH REQUIRED RESERVES. HOWEVER; WITH THE INTXN OF INACCURATE FUEL GAUGES AND FAILURE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ADDITIONAL FUEL BURN DURING WARM-UP PERIODS; I FOUND MYSELF 3 GALLONS OF FUEL SHORT (THE RESERVES) ON SHORT FINAL TO THE DEST ARPT.

THESE EVENTS; AS ACFT MISHAPS OFTEN DO; REPRESENTED A 'PERFECT STORM' OF CIRCUMSTANCES. I KNEW THE GAUGES WERE INACCURATE BUT THE INDICATION THEY GAVE WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE METHOD BY WHICH I CALCULATED FUEL REQUIREMENTS IN THE PAST.

AFTER LNDG AND DISCHARGING THE PAX; I DECIDED TO TAKE OFF DOWNWIND TO SHORTEN THE SHORT HOP N TO MY FINAL DEST.

INSTEAD; RWY YY LEADS OVER AN OPEN FIELD. WITHIN 3-5 SECONDS OF ROTATION; THE ENG STOPPED WITHOUT ANY SPUTTERING. I INSTANTLY REALIZED THAT I HAD RUN IT OUT OF GAS; SO DID NOT TRY TO RESTART. I WAS AT NO MORE THAN 50 FT AGL. THE FIELD (UNTILLED SOYBEAN STUBBLE) EXTENDED ABOUT 700 FT; FOLLOWED BY A DRAINAGE WAY XING PERPENDICULAR TO DIRECTION OF FLT; AND THEN A GRASS FIELD BORDER WHICH WAS ABOUT 1300 FT LONG. I CLRED THE DRAINAGE WAY; AND DID A NORMAL LNDG ON THE GRASS; WHICH SLOPED UP APPROX 3 DEGS. I WAS ABLE TO STOP NORMALLY WITHOUT HARD BRAKING WELL SHORT OF A FENCE AND YARD.

I TAXIED S TOWARDS THE ARPT; BUT SAW I COULD NOT CROSS THE DRAINAGE WAY BECAUSE OF STEEPNESS AND WET CONDITIONS. THERE WAS A SHORT FIELD OF WHEAT JUST GREENING UP TO THE E OF THE GRASS FIELD BORDER. AFTER SHUTTING DOWN THE ENG (AND LEAVING THE XFER PUMP RUNNING!); I WALKED THE GND TO ASSURE IT WAS SOLID ENOUGH TO ATTEMPT A TKOF.

(THERE WAS A 2500-FT LONG OPEN TILLED FIELD W OF THE GRASS FIELD BORDER IF ADDITIONAL DISTANCE WAS NEEDED; BUT THE XING OF THE GRASS FIELD BORDER WOULD HAVE BEEN ROUGH AT SPD). THIS INCIDENT COULD HAVE CAUSED SERIOUS DAMAGE; INJURY; OR DEATH; BUT BECAUSE OF TAKING OFF OVER OPEN FIELDS; I HAD SOME PLACE SAFER TO PUT DOWN. THE CAUSE WAS MY TRYING TO STRETCH THE WING TANK ENDURANCE; MULTIPLE DISTRS OF HAVING A PAX AND DOING SIGHTSEEING (WHICH HAD MY ATTN OUTSIDE THE COCKPIT AND OFF THE INSTS WAY TOO MUCH); AND FAILING TO OBSERVE THE FUEL GAUGES AT ALL DURING THE WHOLE LCL FLT.

ACFT X WAS SLOW TO ENTER THE RWY AND DEPART; AND I INSTRUCTED ACFT Y TO GO AROUND AND OVERFLY THE PARALLEL WATER LANE APPROX 500 FT S OF THE RWY. ACFT Y ACKNOWLEDGED THE GAR; AND I TOLD HIM; 'XWIND TURN AT YOUR DISCRETION; RWY 8 CLRED TO LAND;' INTENDING FOR HIM TO ENTER R TFC FOR RWY 8 AND LAND AGAIN. I INSTRUCTED ACFT X 'FLY STRAIGHT AHEAD' SO HE WOULDN'T TURN INTO THE XWIND AND CONFLICT WITH ACFT Y. AS I UNKEYED THE MIKE FROM MY XMISSION TO ACFT X; ACFT Y; NOW ABOUT 50 FT AGL; MADE A RADICAL TURN TO THE N -- CUTTING LESS THAN 200 FT BEHIND ACFT X -- AND DOVE FOR THE RWY. I INSTINCTIVELY XMITTED 'ACFT Y;' THEN CUT OFF AS I REALIZED HE DID NOT APPEAR IN CTL OF THE AIRPLANE. HE MANEUVERED FOR ABOUT 10 SECONDS BEFORE STABILIZING THE ACFT MERE FT OVER THE RWY; THEN RESPONDED 'I WAS CLRED TO LAND; RIGHT?' I REPLIED; 'THAT WAS A XWIND TURN TO ENTER THE DOWNWIND; BUT YOU'RE OK NOW.' ACFT X WAS ON THE UPWIND CLBING OUT AT THIS POINT; AND IT WAS SAFER TO LET ACFT Y LAND THAN SEND HIM AROUND AGAIN. AT JNU ATCT; WE SEND ACFT AROUND WHEN A LOSS OF SAME RWY SEPARATION IS IMMINENT. HOWEVER; WHEN DEALING WITH AIR TAXI AND OTHER FAMILIAR PLTS; WE USUALLY ISSUE THE GAR; WAIT UNTIL THE RWY IS CLR; THEN ISSUE A LNDG CLRNC WITH A 'LONG LNDG.' THE PLT USUALLY DOES NOT CLB ON THE GAR WHEN HE OR SHE HEARS 'CLRED TO LAND; LONG LNDG APPROVED;' HE OR SHE THEN CHOPS THE PWR AND DIVES FOR THE RWY. ABOUT 99% OF THE TIME; THIS PROC WORKS; BUT IT PROMOTES THE PLT MIND SET THAT A GAR IS MERELY A DELAYED LNDG CLRNC. WHEN WE ACTUALLY NEED THE ACFT TO GO AROUND -- APPLY PWR AND CLB BACK INTO THE PATTERN -- THE PLT EXPECTS AN IMMINENT LNDG CLRNC AND FLIES ACCORDINGLY. IN THIS CASE; THE FOLLOWING PLT WAS SO FIXATED ON LNDG THAT HE JEOPARDIZED HIS ACFT BY PERFORMING A RADICAL LOW-ALT SIDESTEP MANEUVER IN BEHIND THE DEPARTING CESSNA; RATHER THAN CLBING; RE-ENTERING THE PATTERN; AND LNDG SAFELY.

CORRECTION: 1) FLAP POS MUST BE VISUALLY CHKED (IF POSSIBLE) DURING THE POST-LNDG; PRE-TKOF; AND EMER CHKLIST. 2) FLAP POS MUST BE CHKED WHEN ACFT FLIES OFF THE GND BY ITSELF PRIOR TO ACHIEVING ROTATION SPD. 3) FLAP POS MUST BE CHKED WHEN ACFT IS NOT ACHIEVING APPROPRIATE CLB AIRSPD. 4) PIC SHOULD BE THE ONE TO CALL AN EMER.

THE L SEAT PLT WAS VERY AWARE OF HIS PATTERN SPACING; AND I HAVE OVER 50 YRS EXPERIENCE FLYING INTO CONGESTED ARPTS; AND ROUTINELY TEACH SAFE PATTERN SPACING. THE TWR CTLR WAS ATTEMPTING TO EFFECT BETTER PATTERN SPACING BY EXTENDING DOWNWIND LEG FOR MOST TFC. I BELIEVE IT WAS OUR SECOND PATTERN WHEN SHE TOLD US (AGAIN) TO EXTEND DOWNWIND; THIS TIME FOR A SENECA MAKING AN INST APCH ON A MODIFIED STRAIGHT-IN. WHEN THE SENECA PASSED UNDER OUR WING; ABOUT 2 MI OUT; WE BEGAN A BASE TURN. WE WERE STILL AT PATTERN ALT. THE CTLR IMMEDIATELY SHOUTED; 'ACFT X TURN BACK TO DOWNWIND; YOU HAVE INBOUND TFC IN FRONT OF YOU! I WILL CALL YOUR BASE.' WE INSTANTLY COMPLIED; THOUGH WE HAD HEARD NO OTHER TFC APCHING FROM THE W; NOR COULD WE SEE ANY. AFTER ABOUT 2 MORE MI; WITH NO CALL FROM THE TWR AND APPARENTLY NO CONFLICTING TFC; I CALLED THAT WE WERE TURNING BASE. WE HAD SEVERAL ACFT BEHIND US ON DOWNWIND; IMPATIENT TO TURN TO BASE. (MY SURMISE WAS THAT THE CTLR'S DEPTH PERCEPTION AT THE 2 MI DISTANCE DID NOT ALLOW HER TO PROPERLY JUDGE OUR SPACING; OR IT WAS THE C150 BEHIND US WHO ACTUALLY TURNED; AND SHE CONFUSED OUR NUMBERS.) ON OUR THIRD APCH; TWR AGAIN EXTENDED OUR DOWNWIND. SHE DID NOT CALL OUR BASE LEG; BUT CLRED US FOR TOUCH-AND-GO. WE WERE ABOUT 2 MI OUT AND FOLLOWING A CHEROKEE WITH AS TIGHT A SPACING AS WAS SAFE. ON DOWNWIND; WE HEARD THE CTLR ASK THE C150 BEHIND US IF THEY HAD US IN SIGHT; AND THE ANSWER WAS IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. SHE REPEATED THE QUESTION TO THE C150 ON BASE; AND THE ANSWER WAS AGAIN IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. I DID NOT HAVE THAT ACFT IN SIGHT; BUT WAS WATCHING SPACING WITH THE CHEROKEE AHEAD. THE CHEROKEE JUST LIFTED OFF AS WE CAME OVER THE RWY THRESHOLD AND BEGAN TO FLARE. IN THAT INSTANT; I HEARD THE CTLR SCREAM; 'ACFT Y; GO AROUND; GO AROUND!' A SHADOW PASSED OVER US AND THE C150 FILLED OUR WINDSCREEN; ABOUT 20 FT ABOVE US AND JUST BEGINNING TO FLARE. LUCKILY; HIS APCH HAD BEEN HIGHER AND FASTER THAN OURS; AS THE CALL FOR HIM TO GO AROUND CAME ALMOST TOO LATE. AT AN ESTIMATED ALT OF ABOUT 40 FT; ACFT Y FINALLY BEGAN A GAR.

I CAUSED THIS OVERFLT; AS PIC. IT WAS PLT ERROR. THERE WAS NO INTENT OR DESIRE TO VIOLATE. I WAS WELL AWARE OF THE RESTR AREA; WAS ATTEMPTING TO FLY AROUND; AND AT ALL TIMES BELIEVED I WAS CLR. MY FAILURE WAS GETTING INTO A SITUATION OVER MY HEAD; FOCUSING ON CORRECTING THE PROB USING SOLUTIONS BEYOND MY ABILITIES; AND OVERLOOKING THE SIMPLEST BASIC ANSWERS. I AM A LOW TIME PVT PLT. THIS WAS MY FIRST SOLO XCOUNTRY FLT IN 20 YRS. I READ AND REVIEWED THE LATEST FAA REGS; TFR'S; AND CURRENT PROCS. THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES IN THE LAST 20 YRS; NEW AND DIFFERENT NAMES FOR AIRSPACE; ATC; FLT REQUIREMENTS; PROCS. I SOMETIMES FOUND MYSELF WONDERING AM I REMEMBERING THE OLD OR THE NEW. I WAS USING MY NEW ELECTRONIC FLT COMPUTER AND HAND HELD RADIO FOR THE FIRST TIME. I READ THE INSTRUCTIONS ON OPERATING MY COMPUTER; AND RADIO; BUT REMEMBERING THE CORRECT BUTTONS IN THE RIGHT ORDER TAKES MORE PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE THAN I HAD. I REVIEWED USING THE 2 SECTIONAL CHARTS REQUIRED; IDENTING IMPORTANT INFO; MOVING DATA FROM ONE TO THE OTHER; AND WORKING THE ACFT RADIO TO TALK AND COMPLY WITH ATC. I HAD DONE ALL OF THESE WHILE SITTING ON THE GND; WHERE I COULD STOP; ASK QUESTIONS; FOCUSED ON ONE ISSUE; AND TAKE AS MUCH TIME AS NEEDED TO FIND THE CORRECT ANSWERS. BUT I HAD NEVER TRIED DOING IT ALL AT ONCE WHILE CTLING AN ACFT ALONE IN FLT. I ALLOWED THE EXCITEMENT OF A FIRST SOLO XCOUNTRY TO CTL MY JUDGEMENT. MY FIRST MISTAKE WAS CHANGING MY FLT PLAN. I HAD A DETAILED VFR RTE LAID OUT; WELL TO THE W OF P-49; WITH TIME DISTANCE; LANDMARKS; RADIO FREQS IDENTED. THEN WHEN I TOOK OFF FROM DENTON I CONTACTED FLT WATCH WITH THE INTENT OF OPENING AND FLYING MY FLT PLAN. THE RADIO WAS BUSY; AND NOT WANTING TO ADD TO ATC PROBS; I ACCEPTED THEIR VECTOR OF 190 DEGS DIRECT TO KILLEEN. DALLAS IS A BUSY AREA AND I WAS NOT COMFORTABLE USING THE RADIO FOR SEVERAL COURSE CORRECTIONS. I WANTED TO KEEP RADIO USE BRIEF. ACCEPTING THIS DIRECT RTE MADE MY FLT PLAN USELESS. I FOCUSED ALL MY ATTN ON FOLLOWING ATC THROUGH THE DALLAS AREA; SO WHEN I WAS HANDED OFF TO WACO APCH I DID NOT HAVE THE MOST BASIC FLYING REQUIREMENTS. MY SECOND MISTAKE WAS I COULD NOT IDENT EXACTLY WHERE I WAS BY GND REF. I DID NOT HAVE NEEDED RADIO FREQS AVAILABLE. I DID NOT HAVE LANDMARKS IDENTED. DURING THE NEXT SEVERAL MINS I TURNED THIS SIMPLE PROB INTO A MAJOR ISSUE. WACO ADVISED ME I WAS S OF CLEBURNE; BUT I FAILED TO ASK FOR AN EXACT DISTANCE AND LOCATION. WACO GAVE ME A VECTOR OF 150 DEGS TO STEER ME CLR OF P-49; AND AT THE TIME I FELT I WOULD SOON LOCATE MYSELF. SHORTLY AFTER; FOR UNKNOWN REASONS; I FOUND I COULD NOT CONTACT OR HEAR WACO. I WAS FLYING A HDG TO TAKE ME TOWARD WACO AGAINST WINDS AND GUSTS FROM AROUND 180 DEGS. THE ACFT KEPT TRYING TO TURN INTO THE WIND. I HAD BEEN ADVISED OF GUSTY WINDS; BUT THIS WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE ON HOW MUCH THEY WOULD BOUNCE AND TURN MY ACFT REQUIRING ME TO CORRECT BACK ON COURSE. I FOUND I HAD TO WEDGE MYSELF IN THE SEAT; AND MAINTAIN A HVY CONSTANT L RUDDER; AND FIRM CTL ON THE WHEEL. A FEW TIMES I WAS BOUNCED HARD AGAINST THE SEAT BELT; WHICH STARTLED ME. THE UNEXPECTED ROUGH RIDE IN A LIGHT ACFT WAS NEW; VERY DISTURBING AND A FEW TIMES SCARY. I RECALL FEELING VERY TENSE WITH MY L LEG AND ARM BECOMING TIRED AND STIFF. MY THIRD MISTAKE WAS SPENDING COUNTLESS MINS TRYING TO REESTABLISH RADIO CONTACT WITH WACO. CHKING EQUIP; ADJUSTING VOLUME AND SQUELCH; LOOKING FOR THE PROB; ATTEMPTING TO CONNECT AND USE MY HAND HELD WITH MY EARPHONES. DURING THOSE MINS ALL I HEARD ON THE WACO FREQ WAS SILENCE OR A DASH-DOT AND TONE SOUND; WHICH I COULD NOT IDENT. MISTAKE FOUR WAS AT THE SAME TIME I'M OPENING AND WORKING WITH 2 SECTIONALS (DALLAS AND SAN ANTONIO) WITH MY R HAND TO TRY TO LOCATE MYSELF. I BELIEVED I MISIDENTED THE DISTANCE AND DIRECTION OF ONE IMPORTANT BRIDGE LANDMARK; LEADING ME TO ASSUME I WAS MORE TO THE E AND N THAN MY ACTUAL LOCATION. WHEN LANDMARKS I EXPECTED DID NOT APPEAR;I BECAME TOTALLY LOST. I TRIED USING MY ELECTRONIC FLT COMPUTER FOR TIME DISTANCE AND HDGS. I WAS GETTING ANSWERS THAT COULD NOT BE RIGHT; OR WORSE; NO ANSWER AT ALL. LOOKING IN THE INSTRUCTION MANUALS FOR ANSWERS AT THE TIME WAS A BIG MISTAKE. I BECAME FOCUSED ON CTLING THE ACFT DIRECTION; AND KEEPING IT ON A COURSE TOWARD WACO; TRYING TO REMEMBER THE ATC RULES; THINKING I MUST FOLLOW THEIR LAST DIRECTION ON WHAT TO DO; ATTEMPTING TO GET THE RADIO WORKING; COMPUTE MY POS USING AN ELECTRONIC FLT COMPUTER I'M NOT USED TO; LOCATE MYSELF ON THE SECTIONAL WITH FEW LANDMARKS; AND FEELING TOTALLY AT A LOSS WHEN NOTHING WAS WORKING. I FOUND MYSELF CONFUSED; WITH FALSE ASSUMPTIONS; UNSURE WHAT TO DO. AND I WILL ADMIT; SCARED. WHERE WAS I? WHICH WAY TO FLY? DO I HAVE ENOUGH FUEL? WHERE ARE EMER ARPTS? SHOULD I RESET IDENT TO 7600? AFTER WHAT FELT LIKE HRS; BUT I KNOW WAS ONLY MINS; I SAW A BUILT UP AREA WITH A CITY TO THE E. I TOOK THIS TO BE WACO. BY THIS TIME ANY ENJOYMENT OF THE FLT WAS GONE. ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS GET TO KILLEEN AND END THIS FLT. BELIEVING THIS CITY TO BE WACO I TURNED S ASSUMING I WOULD SOON IDENT LANDMARKS AND GET HOME. THEN; S OF WACO; WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING ON MY PART I KNOW OF; I COULD HEAR AND TALK WITH WACO. I DID NOT THEN; NOR DO I NOW KNOW WHAT THE PROB WAS. I FAILED TO STOP; TAKE A BREATH AND THINK OUT THE SIMPLE ANSWER. I KNEW I WAS SOMEWHERE W OF INTERSTATE 35. WHEN THE PROBS STARTED; IF I HAD TURNED TO 090 DEGS; AND FLEW E I WOULD FIND I-35. THERE I WOULD HAVE LOCATED MYSELF CLRLY; BEEN ABLE TO CONTACT SOMEONE; CALM DOWN AND REGAIN CTL; BUT MOST IMPORTANT I WOULD HAVE STAYED AWAY FROM RESTR AREA. IT'S ALL SO SIMPLE AFTER THE FACT! I HAVE NO IDEA WHEN I VIOLATED P-49. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. I WASN'T LOOKING FOR IT. IN MY MIND I WASN'T NEAR IT. I UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR THE RESTR AREA; AND WITH MY MIL BACKGROUND CAN GUESS THE TENSION AND TURMOIL I CAUSED WITHIN ATC; FAA AND OTHER GOV AGENCIES. FOR THIS I OFFER MY SINCERE APOLOGY. IT DOESN'T MAKE UP FOR IT; BUT IT'S SINCERE. I AM VERY; VERY SORRY I MADE THIS FLT! I AM TAKING A STEP BACK. MY GND SCHOOL 30 YRS AGO WAS A 6 MONTH COLLEGE CREDIT COURSE; PART OF A COLLEGE AVIATION DEGREE PROGRAM UNDER FAR 141. I AM ENROLLING AND WILL COMPLETE A SIMILAR STRUCTURED DETAILED GND SCHOOL COURSE. I NEED TO LEARN; UNDERSTAND AND BECOME KNOWLEDGEABLE WITH FLYING TODAY'S AIRSPACE. REINFORCE WHAT I KNOW; AND TEACH ME WHAT I NEED. I HAVE DISCUSSED WHAT HAPPENED WITH MY CLUB'S CHIEF FLT INSTRUCTOR AND SCHEDULING MORE DUAL INSTRUCTOR TIME TO PRACTICE; ORGANIZE AND PERFECT MY COCKPIT MGMNT; ELECTRONICS; AND NAV. I AM AND MUST THINK OF MYSELF AS A STUDENT PLT. I WANT TO BE A GOOD PLT. A SAFE PLT! MY BIGGEST MISTAKE AND FAILURE WAS OVER-CONFIDENCE IN MYSELF. THAT I COULD ACCEPT; ADJUST; ADAPT AND OVERCOME THE CHANGES. THAT; IN MY MIND; I WAS IN CTL AND HAD ALL THE ANSWERS. WHEN THE UNPLANNED AND UNEXPECTED OCCURRED; I WAS NOT READY AND ABLE. WHATEVER ANYONE ELSE THINKS; DECIDES OR BELIEVES; I NEVER WANT TO BE IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT AND FEEL THAT WAY AGAIN.",,,,"A C150 PVT PLT USING BRAND NEW STATE OF THE ART NAV SYS AND PORTABLE COM RADIO; INCURS INTO THE PROHIBITED P-49 AREA.",

UNFORTUNATELY; I APPARENTLY ALLOWED MYSELF TO BECOME SOMEWHAT DISTR; AND DID NOT PROPERLY PROCESS THE WINDS INFO; BUT RATHER FOLLOWED 2 OTHER ACFT ALREADY IN THE PATTERN; AND ENTERED A LNDG PATTERN FOR RWY 30. ON FINAL; I LOOKED FOR; BUT DID NOT SEE; A WINDSOCK; ALTHOUGH I LATER OBSERVED THAT THERE WAS ONE; BUT IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION THAN I WAS LOOKING. I DO NOT RECALL ANY PARTICULAR DIFFICULTY IN MAINTAINING A STRAIGHT APCH ON FINAL; AND BELIEVED THAT I WAS LNDG INTO A CALM WIND. I MADE A SATISFACTORY NORMAL LNDG; AND THOUGHT THAT I HAD THE ACFT FIRMLY PLANTED ON THE GND. SUDDENLY; HOWEVER; THE R WING CAME UP FROM A SHARP GUST OF WIND; WHICH CAUGHT ME COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE. I PROBABLY DID NOT UTILIZE PROPER AILERON INPUT AT THAT POINT; WITH THE RESULT THAT THE L WINGTIP CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE GND; AND THE ACFT SKIDDED TO THE R HAND SIDE OF THE RWY; AND ONTO THE UNPAVED AREA ALONGSIDE. I WAS SOON ABLE TO EXPEDITIOUSLY TAXI BACK ACROSS THE RWY AND INTO TRANSIENT PARKING; MAKING APPROPRIATE RADIO BROADCASTS AS I DID SO; AS THERE WAS STILL MORE LNDG TFC IN THE PATTERN; AND I FELT IT WOULD BE BEST TO GET AWAY FROM AN ACTIVE RWY.

THE ACFT WAS LEFT AT THE ARPT FOR FURTHER INSPECTION AND EVAL OF DAMAGE; WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING CONDUCTED. HUMAN PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS: 1) FAILURE TO PROPERLY PROCESS THE AWOS INFO ON WIND DIRECTION AND SPD. INSTEAD OF UTILIZING AN AVAILABLE RWY 5; I FOLLOWED THE LEADERS IN THE PATTERN; AND LANDED ON A LESS APPROPRIATE RWY 30. 2) FAILURE TO VISUALLY LOCATE THE WINDSOCK ON FINAL; AND OBTAIN SATISFACTORY XWIND INFO BY DIRECT OBSERVATION. 3) FURTHER FAILURE TO FULLY APPRECIATE THE INFO AVAILABLE ON WIND DIRECTION; WHICH LED TO PROBABLE INAPPROPRIATE CTL INPUT WHEN STRUCK BY A STRONG GUST ON ROLL-OUT; WHICH LIFTED THE R WING AFTER TOUCHDOWN.",,,,"A C120 PILOT LANDED IN APPARENTLY CALM CONDITIONS BUT CAUGHT A WIND GUST CAUSING A WINGTIP TO CONTACT THE RWY.

THERE WERE NO KNOWN ISSUES WITH THE PLANE; AND THE WORK WAS EXPECTED TO BE DONE WITH LITTLE TROUBLE FOUND. AFTER A NORMAL STARTUP; TAXI; RUN-UP; AND TKOF; THE ENG BEGAN MISFIRING AND LOST MUCH OF ITS NORMAL PWR. THIS BEGAN WHEN JUST OVER THE DEP FENCE; AND AT AN ALT OF LESS THAN 200 FT. PWR WAS SUFFICIENT TO MAINTAIN LEVEL FLT IN THE TKOF CONFIGN (10 DEGS OF FLAPS); AND WAS CONTINUED THROUGH DEP SECTION OF XWIND AND DOWNWIND SECTION OF PATTERN UNTIL APPROX ABEAM THE APCH END OF THE RWY; AT WHICH TIME THE ENG STOPPED PRODUCING PWR ALTOGETHER.

A STORM HAD PASSED THROUGH HRS PRIOR TO MY DEP; AND THE WX WAS SHOWING SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT BEHIND THE STORM. I HAD BEEN CHKING THE WX AT ALL OF THE LCL RPTING ARPTS; AND THE TREND WAS SHOWING IT TO BE POSITIVE REGARDING CEILINGS. VISIBILITIES WERE NEVER MUCH OF AN ISSUE AS THEY WERE ALL PRETTY MUCH ABOVE 7 MI. MANY ARPTS ALONG MY RTE OF FLT WERE SHOWING CLR; WHILE SOME WERE SHOWING SCATTERED TO BROKEN LAYERS THAT WOULD BE AT LEAST APPROX 1000 FT ABOVE MY CRUISE ALT. AFTER DEPARTING TO THE NW TOWARD ZZZ; THE WX WAS LOOKING GREAT ALL ALONG THE RTE. I WAS TALKING WITH BOTH ZZZ2 AND ZZZ1 APCH FOR ADVISORIES AS A SAFETY PRECAUTION. WHILE APCHING ZZZ; CTLR ADVISED ME OF SOME OF THE CURRENT CONDITIONS AT ZZZ WHICH WERE MARGINAL. AS I FLEW CLOSER TO ZZZ; I NOTICED THE LOW HANGING LAYERS OF CLOUDS WHICH WERE SURROUNDING THE AIRFIELD. I ADVISED APCH THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO GO AROUND THE WX TO THE W BEFORE CONTINUING TO MY DEST ARPT. I PROCEEDED TO DO SO; AND WAS ABLE TO GET AROUND MUCH OF THE WX.

THERE WERE MANY TIMES WHERE I ENDED UP VFR ON TOP AND HAD TO MANEUVER AROUND TO FIND NECESSARY HOLES IN THE SCATTERED TO BROKEN LAYERS OF CLOUDS.

THERE WERE TIMES WHICH I NEEDED TO REMAIN IN CLASS G AIRSPACE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE REGULATORY DISTANCES FROM CLOUDS. I LEARNED MANY EXPERIENCES FROM THIS FLT THAT I NEVER IN MY PROFESSIONAL AVIATION CAREER WILL FIND MYSELF DOING AGAIN. EARLIER BEFORE MY FLT; I RECEIVED A WX BRIEF FROM FSS WHICH INDICATED THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE MANY PROBS OR ISSUES GETTING BACK TO MY DEST. THIS SHOWED ME THAT THESE WX BRIEFS ARE NOT ALWAYS RELIABLE; AND IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE ACCESS TO A COMPUTER TO PREDICT AND FORECAST ON MY OWN. I ALSO LEARNED THAT IF THERE IS EVEN THE SLIGHTEST POTENTIAL FOR WX TO BECOME BAD ENOUGH WHERE IT WAS NEARLY NECESSARY TO FILE IFR; NEVER ASSUME THAT THE FLT WILL REMAIN VFR AND UTILIZE A NON INST CERTIFIED ACFT. I WAS CONFIDENT THAT I WAS ABLE TO RETAIN MY SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AT ALL TIMES WHILE VECTORING AROUND SOME TRICKY AREAS OF WX; WHICH GIVES ME MORE JUSTIFICATION TO CONTINUOUSLY KEEP PRACTICING MY AWARENESS SKILLS. AT NO POINT DURING THIS FLT DID I CONSIDER ANYTHING DONE TO BE UNSAFE. IN FACT; I WAS ABLE TO USE MY JUDGEMENT TO KEEP THE FLT AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE FOR THE SITUATION BY REMAINING IN REGULATORY G AIRSPACE WHEN NECESSARY. UNFORTUNATELY; THERE WERE NOT MANY OPTIONS ONCE I FLEW NEAR THIS WX; AND MY BEST BET WAS TO CONTINUE TO ZZZ AND COMPLETE MY FLT SAFELY. IT WAS A HUGE EYE OPENER THAT WE MUST ALWAYS REMEMBER TO PREDICT WX; BUT KNOW WHILE DOING SO THAT IT CAN AND WILL SOMETIMES CHANGE TO SOMETHING COMPLETELY UNFORESEEN. AT NO TIME WERE ANY REGS BROKEN INTENTIONALLY; ALL THE CHOICES I MADE WERE FOR THE COMPLETE AND UTMOST SAFETY OF FLT AT ALL TIMES.

We were in a non-IFR certified aircraft. No flight plan was filed. A website was consulted for weather; but no preflight brief was attained. The weather was reported as isolated snow showers and light winds. We departed ZZZ1 for ZZZ at XA00 local time with an enroute distance/time of 56 miles/50 minutes. As we circumnavigated the isolated snow showers; our time enroute had extended to 1 hour 40 minutes. The sun had set and daylight was fading; our original destination was obscured with snow; so we decided to divert to another airport. We contacted ZZZ Approach Control and asked for vectoring assistance; but all airports within 20 miles were IMC with snow. The area where we were flying was VFR with unlimited ceiling. I decided that it was safer to land the airplane in a field while we had remaining daylight instead of trying to navigate around snow showers in the dark. No Mayday call was made; but the Approach Controller was informed of our decision. We were given a phone number to contact the Tower after we landed and then descended to the farm field. The field was frozen solid with about 3 inches of snow. The approach was upwind parallel to the furrows. A soft field landing technique was used with no damages/injuries to the aircraft or the 2 occupants. In conclusion; a full preflight brief would have given us a more accurate understanding of the weather we encountered.

Early in the morning after a calm; clear night; aircraft was found to be covered by frost. Weather was unlimited visibility; temperature m01 dewpoint m03. Full DUATS Weather Brief obtained for the short hop. Plan was to show up early (before dawn) and do 3 night takeoffs and landings and then land at the nearby airfield. Wary of aerodynamics effect of frost; used a dragon to preheat engine and melt frost with hot air (water removed to prevent refreezing). Delay prevented execution of initial plan; therefore; only relocation of plane to be performed. Also; since the plane had a 50 hour inspection performed and ignition timing adjusted; there had been some discussion between the owners concerning the proper timing. Timing had been rechecked a second time by an A&P engineer. What ticked us for the recheck was an abnormal RPM drop doing a magneto check. After the further timing; magneto drop was reported at 80 RPM with no differential. Event: After a longer than usual preflight due to frost removal; I taxied to holding point and there; to my surprise; I was getting 200/250 RPM drop on left and 150 on right magneto. Thought that the drop could be due to spark plug fouling due to engine test runs at low RPM. I did a high RPM lean mix run; but situation did not improve initially. After an extended run; I finally barely managed to get within the 150 drop with no differential. Also the carburetor heat check I performed was inadequate: just applied carburetor heat and checked for a drop; did not wait a few seconds if by any chance would get an increase afterward (like you would do inflight). When lined up; I did check for full RPM and I have got them and additionally with 8;000 FT of runway; I was safe for takeoff and reject. Monitored acceleration and takeoff run length and was within parameters. During the second flight of the day (other owners) the mag drop went back to 80 with no differential. Same happened to me during the last flight of the day. Finally one of us came up with the icing possibility. And yes checking dew point and temperature; I was in the serious icing at cruise power conditions. Spring means carburetor ice; well I encountered carburetor ice several times in flight never on the ground. Did not recognize it; did not act on it. Two actions can save the day: 1) While checking on the carburetor heat in pre-take off checks leave it on for a few seconds rougher running engine and then increase of RPM means the same thing both in the air and on the ground: This ice is melting (missed this one). 2) Ensure you have max power RPM on takeoff (which I did). Also; do not discard discrepancies: other owner (with mechanical experience) said mag were dropping 80 RPM after timing adjust and I was getting 250 or after cleaning plugs (or probably reducing icing due to higher RPM) 150 RPM; the latter is within limits; both a far cry from the 80 the plane performed the day before. Finally; if like in this case; you have 8;000 FT or runway in front of you; taking off with carburetor heat on would have been the best bet. Losing the engine on takeoff was not that far in my view.",,,,"Instrument rated private pilot feels he may have taken off with carburetor ice.",

Leaving Leesburg the winds where about 9 gusts to 18 coming down over the mountain. They where veering around; but most of the time favored 35. So I started my takeoff roll and could see the windsock shift to where they had turned to a slight tailwind. In addition the density altitude at the 400 foot airport was 2;400. Between all of this; once I got off the ground after about a 1;500 takeoff roll it took longer than usual for the air speed to come up to 70 MPH. At first I could only coax 100 FPM out of the plane. When I crossed the end of the 5;000 foot runway I was still only 100 FT AGL. And there are hills around.

Practicing a Soft-Field Takeoff from the Right Seat; in preparation for a CFI Checkride.  The second aircraft was being taxied for maintenance purposes with the upper cowling removed.  This aircraft was not making any transmissions on the CTAF (Common Traffic Advisory Frequency).  As we approached rotation speed; approx. 45 mph; the second aircraft taxied onto the active runway.  Had I not taken immediate evasive action; a collision may have resulted.  Upon seeing the aircraft enter the active runway; I immediately closed the throttle and applied maximum braking.  No response or transmissions were made from the other aircraft; which cleared the active and continued taxiing. This is not the first type of event at 15G.  Last year; a truck entered the active runway and collided with a Cessna 150 that was in the flare. Measures have been taken to ensure pedestrians; motor vehicles; etc; remain off of the runway/taxiway environment.  Obviously; we must focus our actions on preventing aircraft from creating a hazard to other aircraft.  This would have been prevented if: 1.) Proper visual lookout was maintained by the person taxiing the other aircraft; 2.) The person taxiing the other aircraft was making and receiving traffic advisories over the CTAF. As pilots; we must always emphasize the See and Avoid concept. Whether operating an aircraft with the intention of flight or not; we must continue to keep a lookout for other air traffic and maintain proper situational awareness at all times.",,,,"Light plane pilot on takeoff roll at uncontrolled airport reports runway incursion by another aircraft taxiing for maintenance.

In this 150; the switch has 3 positions - neutral/off; up; and down. When the switch is pushed into the down position it will return to neutral if you remove pressure from the switch; whereas it will remain in place when pushed into the up position. Upon taxiing off the active runway I noticed the flaps had not fully retracted - they were still at approximately 20 degrees. I thought I may have accidentally pushed the switch back to neutral so I pushed the switch to the down position so the switch would spring back into neutral. The flaps then lowered to the maximum deflection (40 degrees) and did not raise at all when I subsequently pushed the switch to the Up position.Once I had shut down the engine I attempted to further diagnose the problem. The electric flap motor could be heard running if the switch was placed in the Down position; but no sound could be heard when the switch was in the Up position. I checked the fuse and found it to be in good condition. I inspected the flaps outside the aircraft for obstructions or anything that could prevent them from being retracted and found no problems. My determination was that the flap switch had partially broken during the landing rollout. It was still clearly allowing electricity to flow through to the motor in the Down position but not in the Up position.It should be noted that there are no services here. No fuel is available; and there is neither an FBO on the field nor any maintenance facility or A & P Mechanic. Due to this; options were extremely limited as far as addressing the issue with the flaps. I called the FBO that I rented the aircraft from and discussed the issue with one of the owners; who is also an A & P-IA. He instructed me to remove an access panel from underneath the right wing to locate the electric flap motor. I removed the access panel and located the motor. He then instructed me to reach into the wing and try turning the drive coupling on the motor to manually turn the screw drive and raise the flaps. I attempted this for approximately 5 minutes and determined that; while I could turn the coupling; it was not going to retract the flaps.In the process of opening the access panel; I gained access to the two power wires leading to the electric flap motor. Knowing that the flap switch still worked in the Down position and that an electric motor operates on polarity; I suggested to the FBO that I reverse the polarity by switching the wires leading to the flap motor. They told me to proceed and I cut the wires; switched the polarity; and then was able to successfully raise the flaps by placing the switch inside the cockpit in the Down position. I then wrapped the wires leading to the motor with electrical tape; closed the access panel under the wing; and pulled the fuse from inside the cockpit to ensure no electricity would flow through the wires to the electric flap motor. After a complete pre-flight; I was able to depart and return home (including a fuel stop enroute) safely by making no-flap landings.I believe that; acting as PIC under 91.7(b); as well as 91.3; the aircraft was in an airworthy condition and could be operated safely without flaps - that is; it could be operated with the flaps fully retracted but unable to be lowered. No-flap landings are a permissible maneuver per the Pilot Operating Handbook (POH). Thus; I exercised my PIC authority and determined the aircraft was airworthy for the flight home. My concern is in regard to Part 43 and whether or not the act of raising the flaps was permitted. I am submitting this report because; after the flight; I have come to question whether these actions may have been inconsistent with the regulations on maintenance. But I must stress that I did not knowingly or intentionally act in any such manner at the time. I opened the access panel and raised the flaps in accordance with instructions provided by the A & P-IA at the FBO. While I realize that does not exempt me from the FAR's as the PIC; I did believe the actions taken to raise the flaps were legal and necessary. Ultimately; I believe that I did what was necessary - under the guidance of an A & P-IA who also is the owner of the aircraft - to return the aircraft to an airworthy state.For me; this has been a valuable learning experience and certainly will lead me to be much more proactive in the future when it comes to questioning the activities allowed by FAR Part 43; as well as the use/request of a ferry permit if necessitated by the aircraft's condition.","Reporter stated he was later informed the flap selector switch was found to have a bad contact inside the switch.

There was one aircraft in the runup area for Runway 20. I stopped at the hold-short line and made a visual check for aircraft on approach and the aircraft doing his runup. Seeing no other aircraft; I made my departure call on unicom; pulled out to the centerline and started a standard crosswind takeoff. Maybe 900 FT into my takeoff roll I noticed an aircraft taxiing towards the run-up area for Runway 20. By the time I realized he was not going to stop at the runway intersection I was going too fast to abort and not hit him. I was able to lift off the ground and immediately move to the right side of the runway. I crossed over in front of him maybe 30 FT in the air and 30 FT in front. After finishing my training flight I heard that he had admitted to someone that he had been on another frequency; talking with ATC setting up an IFR flight. He did not listen for other aircraft using the uncontrolled airspace and he did not make a visual check before crossing the runway.",,"I started my aircraft in parking and received clearance (IFR) and completed readback.

I then applied my brakes; stopped and saw the C150 climb past above and in front of me. I then noticed I had not changed my radios back to the uncontrolled field's CTAF frequency so I did not hear the departing aircraft's call.

I called weather brief at XA:00; just 2 hours prior to start of flight at XC:00. I was told the visibility was unrestricted and the overcast was stable and was told I should be OK for VFR for the flight. I took off with full fuel at XC:00. Sunset that day was XD:06 and I expected to land at XD:10 within the dusk period. I am not current with my IFR rating and it has been many years since I flew at night. I did not in my flight planning expect to be in the air at night. My weather brief did not indicate I would be aloft in marginal VFR or IFR. I had my Garmin GPS with me and set for the destination airport. It thankfully performed flawlessly and took me right there arriving in marginal VFR at about XD:20. I recalled vaguely seeing something about clicking 5 or 7 times to bring on the light but after clicking many times could not see an airport. I saw a few other lights about but could not see an airport. When I climbed to 2500 FT I entered full IFR in a cloud. I descended but did not want to descend too much because of ridges in the area. I circled several times but no joy. I then decided to proceed due south because I recalled the visibility was better and I had passed several airports. On my way up; Approach had me on their radar and tracked me until I was about 20 miles from destination at which time they lost me and terminated my following. So I left their frequency and went to the local UNICOM but could get no response. After several minutes I went back to Approach and called several times but no reply. Eventually a Cirrus on the frequency heard me calling the relaying to Approach that I needed information on airports to my south and finally after rejecting a few because of no lights or problems at the airports I was directed to an Army Airfield. I dialed it up on my GPS and in a few minutes an Air Rescue helicopter called me just after he took off to come look for me and asked if I could see him. I could and he said follow me. At that time I had good visibility again and in about 5 minutes my GPS and the helicopter got me to the vicinity of the Army Airfield. The helicopter talked to the Tower and asked if it was OK for me to land there or should he take me to a civilian field nearby. They replied that it was OK for me to land and then they called me directly and gave me permission to land either way and circle once if I would like to become familiar with the area. I replied that I would like to land now and was in perfect shape to enter a base leg. I then continued my approach and landed uneventfully and taxied as advised up to just beneath the Control Tower. Then came the fun. A fire truck; an ambulance; police; paramedics; and soldiers took up position around my plane. I got out and proceeded to change into my regular shoes out of my sneakers and was advised to stay by my plane. In a short while the CO of the base came up and requested I follow him. I complied and in their lounge they contacted the FBO I was headed for; and they came with an instructor who flew my plane to their base 25 miles away. The CO; a great guy who had spend 300 hours flying attack helicopters in Iraq; was happy to see my plane gone. All's well that ends well. Reviewing my flight planning and the flight; I have to admit errors in planning and judgement. I called in a flight plan but could not file it after liftoff because the frequency given to me by the briefer did not respond. I did not expect to be up at night but recalled seeing the proper number of clicks to get the lights on. It is not in my experience that those clicks should occur on any frequency other than the UNICOM frequency. I should have gone to another frequency and clicked I learned later. I never expected to not be able to see the airport and have to be up longer than expected...into the night. I know now not to push daylight so late in the future in case of unexpected eventualities. For a time; I have to admit; my mouth was extremely dry and I was breathing very heavy not knowing if the worst would happen to me that night. Approach was very helpful as was the unknown Cirrus driver who relayed for me.",,,,"A C150 pilot planned his flight for a late evening arrival to an airport that he needed airport lighting to find.

Meanwhile; Aircraft Y departed FAI.V438.FYU; on a 032 initial heading; I issued a left turn to 330 leaving 2200 to join V438. I told Aircraft X to enter the left downwind for runway 2R. He made a 180 and turned south towards Aircraft Y. I was distracted by Aircraft Y; also a TRSA departure; who was encountering IMC and requesting an IFR pickup to CIK. HO1/CIC pointed out the conflict between the two. I turned Aircraft X right 20 degrees and issued traffic. Aircraft Y reported Aircraft X in sight and was told to maintain visual; I believe before the targets merged; but I'm not sure.  Aircraft X had reported at 2800; last altitude readout I remember seeing on Aircraft Y was 2400. Bottom line; I should have immediately realized that Aircraft X's return to FAI would be a direct conflict with Aircraft Y. Aircraft Y's IFR pickup could have waited a few minutes until I'd resolved the conflict; and I should have been doubly careful since Aircraft X's Mode C was disabled (no CA). Recommendation; I was reluctant to use altitude separation since Aircraft Y was climbing into a higher MVA and Aircraft X was returning for weather; but I could have issued a sharper turn for Aircraft X and turned Aircraft Y out to the east as well.",,,,"FAI controller described near loss of separation event when failing to issue timely corrective action/s.",

During and after the purchase of the plane; I had my A&P do a pre-buy and then fix any problems that made the airplane unsafe to fly. In preparation for the flight; I read the operating manual and flew 1.5 hours prior to a planned flight to ZZZ; about a two hour trip. During the cross country flight from home to ZZZ; approximately three miles from ZZZ; I noticed that the fuel gauges were at a quarter of a tank and I thought that I had enough fuel to make it to ZZZ.  The engine started to sputter so I looked for a place to land and ran through the dash to see what was wrong.  I found that the fuel; magnetos; and the master switch were all on.  The mixture was leaned to best rpm; so I pushed it in and then pumped the throttle in and out.  This seemed to work and the engine took off again.  In addition; I made a quick call to the other plane I was traveling with to let him know what was happening.  Still traveling I kept looking for a place to put the plane down while heading towards the ZZZ airport.  The engine sputtered again and then I pumped the throttle again; the engine took off again.  I looked to the left and there was the airport.  I made my call to the airport and stated that I was low on fuel and needed priority to land.  As I was entering final I noticed that the runway number was wrong and realized that I was at ZZZ2.  I landed the airplane and turned onto the taxiway across the hold short line then the plane ran out of fuel.  I refueled the airplane and looked for any leaks on the ground; none were visible.  I performed a run-up and checked for power; then took off to ZZZ. Evaluating the situation; I went over my flight plan which included speed; altitude; distance; and fuel burn rate.  Per the manual using the highest burn rate; I had plenty of fuel to make the trip with the proper reserve amount.  The plane used more fuel than anticipated; lower speed and more time in flight.  Currently with the A&P's help I'm evaluating why the plane used so much fuel.  We suspect that the seals of the engine have not seated which caused bad combustion or there were a minor loss while flying from the fuel vent as there were not any fuel leakages on the ground.  What I should have done differently was to fly the plane a little more before taking off on a cross country flight and evaluated the fuel burn rate.  Two of the airports which were on our list as alternative landings were fogged in but their was another small airport approximately sixteen miles from ZZZ that I could have landed and refueled.",,,,"C150 pilot reports running out of fuel on a cross country flight of 2.5 hours and making an emergency landing at the first available airport.

While in the right downwind for Runway XX and close to turning right base I suddenly saw [another aircraft] at my 11:00 o'clock.

I did transmit that a plane had come very close to me while in the pattern.  Nobody responded.  After landing and while on the runway I communicated with an airplane approaching to land that I was about to clear the runway.  I did not check to see if it was the plane I had seen before in the pattern.  What I learned: Always make sure to have the landing light on prior to entering a landing patter; or when taking-off from an airport. I normally do this but I forgot since the last time I flew my plane was over 2 months ago. Flying more frequently is another lesson for me. I suggest that ATC directs a departing aircraft in the direction of a secondary airport to provide a heading directly above the runway to avoid that aircraft from entering the landing pattern.  Also; ATC should ensure that aircraft heading in the direction of Class D secondary airport have their landing light on.  Same suggestion for aircraft landing at secondary airport.  Other lesson I learned is the importance of landing by entering the active runway downwind leg.  Had I entered the pattern via the right base; as I used to do and other pilots I observed doing; I would not have seen the interfering aircraft although I would have made a larger picture for him to see.",,,,"The pilot of a C140 experienced a NMAC with a low wing aircraft while entering the pattern at a non-towered airport.",

Everything was within norms with throttle set at approximately 2;100 RPM for slow descent. Mixture had been leaned at cruise at 8;500 FT approximately 30 minutes earlier. Plane was immediately set for best glide and trimmed. Plane was banked towards two-lane highway about half-mile away. Mixture was set to full rich and engine restart was attempted twice. Each time it ran rough for just a few seconds. On the third attempt engine would only turn over. Emergency radio announcements were made twice on the CATF. After making a couple of shallow turns to look at nearby rough dirt roads; the decision was made to stay with landing on the paved road; even though it was moderately busy with traffic. Though the final few feet of the landing approach was close to the traffic going the same direction; the oncoming traffic easily saw the plane and pulled to the side of the road. There was never a time that the plane could not have been diverted to the relatively flat; though bushy; terrain on the sides of the road if it appeared the cars on the road could not be cleared. Landing was with full flaps. The plane slowed quickly; and was steered down into a slight gully and into some small bushes in order to not remain in traffic. Airport personnel were called immediately to report my status. Two A&Ps drove from the airport and quickly ascertained that the mixture cable had snapped at a point where the cable goes into the carburetor housing. There was nothing to indicate any out-of-the-ordinary wear and stress on the cable; so at this time; it appears to be a defective or weak cable that just broke. Trips were made for parts and to retrieve engine log books. Repair was made; logs were signed to indicate airworthiness; and permission was obtained from the FAA for the Department of Public Safety to block traffic so the plane could be flown out. One of the A&P/Pilots flew the plane the approximate 6 NM flight back to ZZZ without further incident.",,,,"C150 student pilot reports engine failure approaching his home airport and elected to land on a two lane highway.

I then entered downwind and called the entry; base; and 2 calls on final for Runway 23. There was no answer to any calls. I landed a bit long as the runway was 5;000 FT and far more than required. I saw no markings on the runway to indicate an abnormal situation. After parking and entering the FBO I was told '23 is closed for landing'. I asked why no one mentioned on the UNICOM; and no markings were on the runway; and apologized; as it was an honest mistake; but I am not sure what else I could have done. I then asked if this was the case why did they not X out the runway; or put the info on the AWOS; if they couldn't monitor the UNICOM. I was then told it was open for take off for some of the corporate jets that use the airport. As we stood there a Piper Saratoga also announced he was entering the pattern for 23. I can only assume he also repeated the process I experienced. This time the FBO replied to his call entering the pattern and he changed to another runway.

When I performed the preflight inspection on the airplane I checked the fuel level by sticking my finger into the tank and I could feel fuel at the tip. Going off of that and the gauges I estimated I had roughly 16 gallons left. I checked my flight plan and I had a estimated burn of 12 gallons for the leg; which would leave me a little over a 30 minute reserve.Once I departed I checked my time over my first way-point on the map. I calculated that I had a ground speed of 84 MPH and continued to the next way-point on the sectional. Somewhat later I encountered an extreme head wind that was right on my nose. When I checked over the next way-point I came up with a 58 MPH ground speed. At that time I looked at the fuel gauges and continued flying on the heading while thinking about finding an alternate airport; due to the extreme winds. After looking on the sectional I realized that I had already passed the last airport prior to my destination.When I got about 8 miles away from my destination the engine started to run rough. I quickly glanced at my oil pressure and temperature along with fuel quantity and pulled the carburetor heat. After 20 seconds of running rough the engine died and I immediately set the plane up for best glide speed and starting to look for a suitable landing site. I was over some pretty rough terrain and only had a couple options; the one I chose was a rural gravel road that was on a north and south heading. I then concentrated on flying the airplane while going through everything in preparation of a crash landing. Once I set up on final I shut the fuel and master switch off and I opened my door.After I landed I pushed the aircraft off the road into a yard and went and got help. I pulled the engine through to check and see if it had good compression and it did. Then I sumped the tanks and got fuel out of them and also had fuel in the strainer. I attempted to start it; and it started right off. At that time I called some friends and told them to bring out some fuel.Shortly after we put fuel in it local law enforcement arrived and I provided a written report. After both the troopers and I talked with FSDO to make sure the airplane could take back off from the gravel road we made arrangements to find a pilot to do it. I did not even think about trying it. A qualified pilot from my destination airport came out and did a preflight and a run up and then departed for the airport.In summary I believe the cause of engine failure was due to fuel exhaustion due to unexpected strong headwinds and turbulence. To prevent it I should have topped the aircraft off before departing; and I should have landed and fueled up.",,,,"Following a perfunctory fuel check prior to his short cross country; a C150 Private Pilot suffered engine failure due to fuel starvation a few miles short of his destination and landed on a gravel road.

The landing gear bulkhead assembly is made of solid aluminum so I know it could not be delamination; but a result of corrosion.  On initial inspection I could see that the lower row of rivets on the outboard side (the bucktails) were completely eroded away from the corrosion that had caused the aluminum to separate.  Upon removal of the landing gear I could see much more damage that was present.  On the lower portion of the component; the aluminum bar that supported the weight of the landing gear while the aircraft is airborne (the aluminum) had swelled up and separated from deep corrosion that had the appearance of delamination of a composite structure. Large pieces of aluminum had been flaking off for some time and had eroded between 1/16 to 1/8 of an inch in depth.  With further inspection of the component; it was found that corrosion was present in the upper portion of the aluminum and had also began to swell; which in turn caused one rivet head to be sheared off from the tension that was put on the rivet.  Parts of the upper portion of the [stiffener] component that was beginning to swell had also developed cracks from the expansion of the aluminum.","Reporter stated the corrosion was on the left main landing gear bulkhead stiffener. The aircraft had been built in 1962. He was doing the second Annual Inspection since the owner had bought the aircraft. A different IA Inspector had performed the previous inspection for the same owner. Reporter stated the bulkhead stiffener is a half inch thick of solid forged aluminum. The Service Manual; Section 19-52; states that no cracking or damage is allowed. There are no pictures in the Service Manual. Mechanics have to use the Cessna Illustrated Parts Catalog (IPC) Figure 11B; Item #3; to get a breakdown of the components. Mechanics have to use the 1963-1969 Service Manual because the aircraft Serial Number is included in that grouping. Reporter stated access to the lower area of the stiffener is a little difficult because a mechanic has to look up through the opening in the lower fuselage where the spring gear (main gear) comes through; after removing a collar and gasket that covers the opening on the lower external fuselage around the spring gear. That area of corrosion on the lower section of the stiffener cannot be seen from inside the aircraft. But the upper section of the same bulkhead stiffener and spring gear can be seen from under the pilot seats after removing access panels; corrosion had already started on the upper end.  Reporter stated he found one-eighth of an inch deep corrosion on each side of the stiffener. But an 'L' bracket that was attached to the stiffener was not corroded at all; even though the stiffener was swelling and flaking-off aluminum at the same location. The spring gear comes through a forward to aft elongated hole in the bulkhead stiffener with wedges that secure the spring gear in the stiffener; allowing landing loads to be transferred to the upper section of the stiffener. Reporter stated the entire area of the left bulkhead stiffener was dry; no evidence of water or moisture accumulation; no fuel; oil; or hydraulic fluid or lines were in that area. All three landing gear wheels had wheel pants (fairings) installed; which drastically reduced the amount of water that would normally splash up on the gears.  But he still had to remove the entire floorboard area inside the Cessna 150B to perform a major repair involving removing the left main gear and replacing the entire bulkhead stiffener forging.",,,"During an Annual Inspection a Mechanic with an IA (Inspection Authority) rating reports discovering severe exfoliating corrosion on both sides of a left landing gear bulkhead stiffener forging on a Cessna 150B.

The flight of aircraft was in a loose diamond formation. All the pilots were monitoring and communicating on the air-to-air frequency. I had been flying approximately 2:15 minutes since I filled my tanks. The flight was planned for less than three hours. My plane; when topped off; typically has [a] four hour endurance. The weather conditions were: ceiling about 2000 FT overcast with occasional light rain; visibility 10 miles; wind was less than ten knots out of the north. While in cruise flight at approx 1400 FT MSL (1300 FT AGL) and about 90 mph IAS I detected some minor engine roughness. I suspected it might be carburetor ice so I applied carburetor heat. The engine quit suddenly. I broadcast to the flight that I had an engine failure. I observed a two lane road ahead that appeared to be within gliding distance. The other pilots in the flight (I was number two on the right side of the formation) assisted me by calling out traffic on the road. When I was about 500 FT AGL the other pilots said there was no southbound traffic coming in the opposite direction and there were two cars northbound (the direction I was landing) but they were far enough behind me that I could safely land in front of them. I slipped the plane slightly to get down and slow down and made a landing on the road that was uneventful. My plane coasted to a stop. The pilot of the helicopter in the flight landed in a clearing nearby and came to my assistance. I confirmed that I had plenty of fuel remaining. I inspected the engine and fuel tanks and did not notice any defects. After a short time I climbed in and the plane started normally. I did a run-up and mag check and the engine was performing normally. I was concerned about blocking traffic so with the assistance of the helicopter pilot and some passing motorists who stopped traffic on the highway I took off and landed at the nearest airport about 24 miles away. Shortly after I departed the local police and highway patrol arrived in response to calls about a 'plane down on the highway.' The officers spoke to the helicopter pilot and were upset about my take-off from the highway. Lessons learned: 1) when the engine quit; I concentrated on 'flying' the plane while quickly scanning for a place to make an emergency landing. Since I was flying low to the ground I did not have time to 'troubleshoot' the reason for the engine failure. In the past I had thought about what I would do in the event of an engine failure. I had considered roads as possible landing sites but knew there could be power lines and vehicles. I had already made up my mind that I would not land on a road if it would jeopardize people in vehicles. Off to both sides of the road were pastures where I could have landed if the road was not available; If the other pilots had not advised me that the road was clear I would have. 2) I recall hearing only about half of the other pilot's transmissions. I later learned that the other pilots had advised me to switch tanks; apply carb heat etc. I did not recall hearing those transmissions which I attribute to 'tunnel vision.' 3) This incident definitely pointed out the importance of flying at a higher altitude when possible since it gives you more time; more options and a longer glide. Though I could not have flown much higher due to the ceiling in this case; I will definitely fly [at a] higher AGL in future flights. 4) I became overly concerned about blocking traffic on the road. I should have taken more time to 'calm down' and thoroughly examine the engine to determine the cause of the engine failure before taking off again. I quickly thought it was carb ice but it could have been something else. In either case; before taking off I should have made sure the plane was safe to fly even though I was impacting traffic. I also should have waited for the local police to assist; if and when a takeoff from the road was safe to perform. 5) It definitely helps to regularly think about what you would do if the engine failed now; where you could make an emergency landing. I was very lucky there was a place to land. For the previous hour of flight I was flying over mountainous terrain that was heavily forested. A successful emergency landing then would have been unlikely. Therefore; I will choose my route of flight with more consideration of the terrain. 6.) The police notified the FAA who contacted me by telephone and requested a written report on the circumstances of this event. The FAA asked me to include details on my flight time etc. In the process of getting this information together from my logbook I discovered my bi-annual flight review was due before the trip. I failed to periodically review my logbook to make sure I did not miss the date for completing the flight review. To prevent this from happening again I have posted in my hangar a sign in plain sight reminding me of the date of my next biannual.",,,,"C120 pilot on a cross country flight with two other aircraft and a helicopter experiences engine failure and lands on a country road.

I checked weather; radar; and satellite prior to departure. The weather appeared clear with high ceilings. As I came around Uppolu Point at 3;500 FT I could see that the northeast coast now had a low ceiling of about 2;000 FT. I descended and flew along the coast over the water because the terrain to my right was sea cliffs above 1;000 MSL. I got a report over CTAF from other traffic passing me the opposite direction (from ITO). The pilot report indicated some rain but ceilings no lower than 1;300 MSL. I descended below the ceiling and continued to monitor the visibility behind me in case I had to turn around. The ceiling kept coming down. When it got to 1;000 FT I decided to turn around.With terrain to my immediate right; dark clouds in front; ceiling at 1;000 and coming down I had very few options. I could have descended further but I was already in a descent and there was an updraft along the entire coast making it difficult to go down. I did not feel experienced enough to fly below 1;000 FT over the ocean so I decided to level off at 1;000 FT and turn around. I checked behind me and it looked clear so I started a turn to the left since there was terrain to my immediate right. Upon starting the standard rate turn to the left I entered a cloud. I managed to complete the 180 degree turn by instruments while still in the cloud. I held the new course and altitude until I saw a wisp of blue below me.

The second pilot was making a normal wheel landing. The touchdown and roll-out were proceeding normally. We were landing on Runway 22. The winds were 250 at 5 with no gusts stated on the AWOS. As the aircraft slowed it began to slowly drift right. The first pilot was following through on the rudder pedals and the correction the second pilot was inputting was initially sufficient. Then the aircraft moved more quickly to the right and with full corrective rudder deflection already input the second pilot initiated left brake.

A Citabria with an instructor and student were also in the Runway 15 pattern performing training. We had both made a couple of takeoffs and landings and were halfway apart from each other in the pattern. A high wing single engine Cessna was practicing an ILS instrument approach to Runway 33 out on the procedure turn seven miles out. It was a VFR day with good visibility. It was a great day for flying. All three of us were making normal position reports on the radio. I was on left base for Runway 15 and after my 'left base 15' radio call I heard the practice instrument traffic report that they were inbound of the final approach fix for a practice ILS approach. I keyed the mic and asked; 'How will this approach terminate?' They came back saying that they were planning to execute a low approach and then asked if I thought there would be a conflict between our two aircraft; mine on left base for 15 and theirs inbound of the FAF on the ILS. I am an instrument rated pilot and familiar with the ILS 33 approach. It was good visibility and the ILS traffic had their landing light on making them quite visible. Typically when there is other traffic in the pattern for 15 the practice instrument traffic on 33 will break off the approach at the 500 FT circle to land minimums and then execute either the missed approach procedure; climb and then turn right back to the holding fix; or will enter the pattern for a circle to land. This is what I expected them to do based upon the call of 'low approach'. This was an incorrect assumption on my part! By my estimate of our positions I would be on the runway on the roll of my touch-and-go while they would be over the numbers 33; which is more than a mile away; and executing a climbing right turn back to the holding fix. That seemed a safe separation. We were talking and coordinating actions. I responded that if they were doing a low approach then I didn't think there would be a problem of conflict between us. And with that we both continued doing what we were doing. My touch-and-go landing was uneventful and I stayed on the roll on my main wheels. I kept the opposite direction ILS traffic in sight at all times. I saw the other aircraft proceeded lower and continue the approach lower than I expected. For several seconds I was in denial; surely they weren't going to actually land opposite direction. We had been talking and they had reported that they were performing a low approach. I expected they would be no lower than the circle to land minimums and would turn right for the missed approach. But it looked to me like they were now continuing on for a landing. At this point I was about five feet off the runway. Many possible scenarios flashed through my head. I might have chopped the power and landed to a full stop but if they continued and landed in front of me then that would put us together in the middle of the runway and me without a lot of options. I decided I should continue flying so that I could maneuver away but stay as low as possible expecting them to eventually climb and turn right. I started a sidestep to the right and then I became concerned that they might break off with a non-standard left turn since sometimes practice Runway 33 instrument traffic will do that to avoid the left hand pattern traffic of Runway 15. If they did that then that would put us into a serious conflict situation. Some more seconds passed and I had sidestepped off the right side of the runway and climbed to about twenty feet to ensure that I would clear the windsock but I was determined to stay as low as possible in order to give altitude separation between us when they eventually climbed away as I was sure they would do. But they were now well below 100 feet AGL and were potentially landing on the runway. Eventually I saw them suddenly bank hard right and start climbing. By that sharp action I would guess that is when they saw me. We passed each other in opposite directions off of our left sides with me at 25 FT AGL and the other aircraft about 25 FT above my altitude and 150 FT away with each of us on opposite sites of the 100 FT wide runway. I continued to keep sight of them since now we would both be making climbing turns toward each other and could be another potential conflict later. Upon making my 'left crosswind 15' radio call I told the practice instrument traffic that I had expected them to do something different than they had done and that had undoubtedly contributed to our close pass. I received two mic clicks in response and nothing more from them. I made a normal pattern and landing and put the airplane into the hanger. Even though we were on the radio and talking it didn't mean that we were communicating. And I imagine that inside the cockpit of the other aircraft the same situation applied between the pilot training and the safety pilot. I expected them to do something other than what they were doing. In later reflection upon the call 'low approach' I realize that it is a very non-specific call and could mean any of a number of things and not necessarily what I thought it would be at the time. Upon reflection I now realize that they had probably always intended to shoot the approach to minimums but were only intending not to actually touch down. If I had realized this I would have made different decisions. This misunderstanding on my part led me to accept the situation and allowed us to come to close proximity even though we were both talking and saying what we thought was appropriate and in visual contact. I then was in denial about the situation for several seconds. I imagine they thought I was either doing something different from what I was doing or that I was in a different location in the pattern. They may have confused my aircraft on the base leg with the Citabria in the pattern on the crosswind leg and thought that they had the runway clear for them. I did keep them in sight at all times and was determined to avoid them but in retrospect I imagine they did not have my airplane in sight until the last moment. When I started to see the situation develop I should have keyed the mic immediately and coordinated with them again to ensure that we each knew what the other was doing. I should have turned on my landing light to increase my visibility. I should be more vigilant when sharing airport operations with several different aircraft. I had become complacent with 'the way things normally work' here and then didn't react quickly enough when things became abnormal.",,,,"A C140 pilot reported a NMAC with an practice instrument approach aircraft whose pilot was talking on CTAF with two other pilots and did a low approach on the opposite direction runway as one of two pattern aircraft was taking off.",

A student weighing about 220 LBS and an Instructor (person filing the report and pilot in command of the airplane) weighing about 200 LBS were the only occupants. To keep gross weight under approved C150M gross weight limits; it was necessary to use partial fuel. Cessna C150M published payload is 340 LBS with full fuel which necessitated reduction of weight by partial fueling. The first flight of the day started with 3/4 fuel by visual inspection and by fuel gauge indication. No other fuel measurement method was available. The amount of fuel according to the fuel gauges and visual inspection was 3/4 of 22.5 gallons usable; or 17 gallons. The first flight after the initial inspection lasted 1.5 hours during which active leaning procedures were used. 10 more gallons were added after the first flight. A second flight of 1.2 hours was then flown during which active leaning procedures were used. 5 gallons were added and a third flight of 2.1 hours during which active leaning procedures were used; resulted in an off-airport landing. Engine surging was experienced during the takeoff portion of the flight at about 500 AGL. Partial power was available during the event flight. An off-airport landing was chosen to insure safe outcome due to surging and a plowed field was chosen for landing. No property damage or personal injury took place. The airplane was refueled and repositioned to the airport shortly after the event. A factor was a defective fuel gauge which indicated half-full during the flight. The faulty indicator was observed and verified by two independent observers.

The GPS switched to battery power and indicated that a suitable airport was about 10 miles to the south. I was still some 42 minutes from my destination. I made the decision to land there. About 6 miles north of the field the engine started making a loud strange noise. As I approached the noise got louder. I made the decision that it was essential to land as soon as possible. As I approached the airport property from the northeast I descended to about 500 FT MSL. Due to the wind direction; the active Runway was XX. I made the decision to land on Runway YY the farthest runway to the southeast. There was still no internal electric power and the engine noise was getting louder; however; the GPS was operating on its own battery power. At about midfield across from the Control Tower I passed about 500+ FT underneath an airplane apparently on a downwind leg for Runway XX; which is the only airplane I saw that was airborne. Shortly thereafter; I landed on Runway YY. As I was taxing to the tarmac I saw the first light signal which was a steady red light from the Control Tower.

She wasn't climbing anymore; and the engine seemed to have an oscillating sound to it instead of the usual full-power drone heard during take-offs. I immediately requested [return to a runway]. It would have been easier to enter left downwind of that runway's pattern and land. ATC gave it to me; but then the airplane felt like it may have been dropping; the engine sounded worse; and I had a sort of gut feeling that if the plane wasn't on the ground soon; I wouldn't be landing on a runway. I told Tower I was declaring an emergency and was going to take [the nearest runway] (winds were calm that morning). There was no other traffic in the area; and I knew I wouldn't be fighting a tailwind.

When the airplane finally stopped and the propeller stopped spinning; I noticed the airplane nose was pointing to the ground. At that moment I called CTAF and advised them of the accident.I think these were the reasons for the mishap:1. The airplane was too fast during touch down. I believed that had I extended the flaps to 30 degrees; the increased drag would have slowed the airplane down to 65.2. I did not flare enough before the moment of touchdown; and probably caused the nose wheel to come into contact with the ground before the main wheels. This might be the reason that the airplane bounded back into the air.3. I panicked and applied the brakes hard; and this probably caused the nose to tip downward; and the propeller to strike the runway. Lessons learned:1. Extend flaps to 30 degrees on final to slow the airplane further; and to increase angle of descent.2. Execute flare early enough for the airplane to have the proper attitude at touchdown.",,,,"C150 student pilot describes a bounced landing resulting in damage to the aircraft during his first solo flight.",

I noticed the aircraft as the student was setting takeoff power at approximately 35 KTS. I yelled stop over CTAF with no response. I didn't have time to be more specific. The C-172 was taxiing west along Taxiway K paralleling Runway 8R/26L and we had heard no prior radio call. I was executing a touch and go on Runway 13. Winds were reported at 120/7 on AWOS. I was the only other airplane operating in the pattern at the time. A helicopter was also doing air work in the area; two other airplanes had recently landed on Runway 13. My student had made all of the appropriate radio calls; including a final call about one mile final. I did de-brief that the landing light was not on for the landing. At the time the aircraft crossed in front we were at a speed that a continued takeoff would have used less runway than an abort. The aircraft were not at risk of a collision as the crossing aircraft was moving at about 10-15 KTS and was about 1;500 FT down the runway. We rotated prior to Taxiway J. I believe the C-172 was taxiing to Runway 8R; but then later on taxied to Runway 13 as multiple airplanes were arriving into the pattern for Runway 13.I believe that F45 is in need of a Tower. It is one of the busiest uncontrolled airports in Florida. The runway layout and weight restrictions they have make it so airplanes are required to use intersecting runways regardless of the wind. There are frequent near-misses and various aircraft using non-standard traffic patterns. This all added in with the high volume of training is making F45 a very dangerous place.",,,,"A flight instructor training a student on touch and go landings on Runway 13 at F45 was alarmed when a C-172 crossed their runway westbound on Taxiway K as the student was applying takeoff power.

I was flying and demonstrating the student's first takeoff; on Runway 31L. At [3;700] FT; this is the shorter of the two runways at the airport. Our original plan was to fly the Blake Departure to take us west of the airport. When North Flow procedures are in effect; Runway 31L is normally used for westbound departures and 31R for eastbound departures. We were cleared for takeoff from Runway 31R and instructed to fly the Blake (westbound) Departure. This essentially was a clearance to takeoff from 31R and then turn left and depart through the departure path of 31L; which was also an active runway at that time. In years of flying/instructing at the airport; I've never received a takeoff clearance from one runway that included departure instructions to cross the flight path of the other active runway. Lined up on 31R I queried the controller about the departure clearance. The same confusing clearance was delivered once again. I explained to my student that sitting on an active runway was not the place to sort out departure confusion. The weather was VFR; we had a takeoff clearance and could climb straight out until the departure issue was sorted out. I proceeded with the takeoff. The airplane had been trimmed for the proper takeoff setting. Power application and acceleration seemed normal. At 45 KIAS the airplane became airborne; a bit sooner than expected and began to climb. (Vs 1G for the airplane is about 47 KIAS) I instinctively lowered the nose to increase airspeed toward 60 KIAS in the climb. My first thought was that the wind; which had been down the runway at 7 KTS; had increased. As the airplane continued its initial climb; airspeed increased slightly; but not as much as I expected. The engine was smooth and appeared to be producing full power. Flaps were up and the airplane was very controllable but 'felt' like it had more drag than it should have. By the time I analyzed all of these possibilities; there was insufficient runway remaining to abort the climb. As the plane was controllable I continued to climb at 100 FT per minute past the airport perimeter. I notified Tower that I had a problem and would need to stay in the pattern rather than depart to the west as had been the original plan. The airplane was under control; albeit in a very shallow climb; but airspeed was still hovering around 50 KTS. I began to suspect that I might have an airspeed indicator issue; but wanted to hold off on further troubleshooting until I reached a safe altitude. I concentrated on flying a track that would clear obstacles and get me to pattern altitude safely. At 600 FT and about 2 miles from the airport I turned crosswind and declared an emergency with Tower. Nearing the downwind leg I found a large hospital protruding into my climb path. The airplane's rate of climb also seemed to diminish. Maneuvering around the hospital; the airplane eventually made it to pattern altitude. I notified Tower of my intent to stick with a landing at the airport. Next I switched on my iPad to read a GPS ground speed off of my charting application (Foreflight). Ground speed was 90 KTS. This essentially confirmed that I had a pitot issue and a safe landing was executed on Runway 31L at the airport. In training circles; a blocked pitot is often discussed. The most common example used ad nauseam represents a fully blocked pitot situation where the airspeed indicates zero airspeed. Had I seen very little or no airspeed during the takeoff roll; I would have instinctively aborted the takeoff. The partial failure in this case was far more insidious. I had just enough indicated airspeed to continue with the takeoff and commence the initial climb. The 'drag' I felt on the airplane during the subsequent climb was imagined. It stemmed from my aversion to allowing airspeed to decay further and resulted in an attempt to climb in a cruise attitude. A contributing factor may have been the preceding confusion of a takeoff clearance that included counter intuitive departure instructions.",,,,"C150 instructor pilot experiences an airspeed indicator malfunction during takeoff resulting in a low airspeed; but interpreted as excessive drag. Once safely airborne the iPad is turned on and GPS ground speed is compared with indicated airspeed to confirm that the airspeed indicator is erroneous.",

As it turned out; he was on final; but I did not see him. Good thing he did a go-around; as otherwise; he may not have been able to stop before colliding with me if he had landed.In retrospect; I suspect both pilots may have announced being on final on CTAF; but I was not aware of it being two separate aircraft.

I determined I could not land on the remaining runway and it was doubtful if I could land straight ahead without hitting the airport perimeter fence. I elected to make a 40 degree turn to the right to land in a plowed field. At this point I keyed the mike and said; 'Mayday.' After making the turn; the engine was still producing power; so I made another 40 degree turn to land across the airport property. After that turn; I then had the option to land on the grass runway. At this time; I did a second call to the tower and repeated 'Mayday' three times. It is possible I stepped on a tower transmission to clear a Mooney for takeoff. On short final to the grass crosswind runway; I heard the tower hold the Mooney in position for me. I landed uneventfully on the sod runway and requested to taxi to the hangers which was given. After taxiing to my hangar; I called the Tower on my cell phone and thanked them for their help and verified they heard my 'Mayday' call. They said they did hear it once and they were happy that I was able to land safely. The only regulations that I may have broken are that I didn't follow ATC instructions for left traffic and I landed on the sod runway without a clearance.

I immediately pitched for best glide speed and began troubleshooting as I turned southbound towards a field I determined I could land in. After exhausting my troubleshooting options; I informed Tower that I was setting down in a field north of [nearby lake]; that I had quarter to half tanks and two souls were on board. After landing successfully I informed the Tower that I was on the ground and everyone was OK. I called the FBO and asked that a ride for my student head our direction. When the fire truck arrived; I told them that everything was OK; and that our Mechanic was heading out to check the airplane. After they left I spoke with the Sheriff when he arrived and gave him my information. He then left; and the ride for my student showed up and took him back to the airport.Once the student had left; I began investigating the situation with the aircraft and determined that there may have been a fuel blockage in the system because there was still fuel in both tanks and the fuel strainer/sump showed fuel when drained. After becoming convinced that the fuel system was operating properly; I added a little more fuel to the aircraft and removed the passenger seat to keep the aircraft lighter. I then performed a soft/short field takeoff and flew it back to our home airport where I had another Mechanic further check it.Before I departed for the flight; I had preflight a Piper aircraft which I was going to take. However; as I was pulling the aircraft out to be flown; the Cessna returned from its flight with the Senior Instructor aboard. He asked me if I would take the Cessna; which I agreed to do. However; I did not preflight it; I took on faith that it was in an airworthy condition since it had just been flown. I also did not check the fuel level visually; rather I trusted the gauges which were reading just under a half tank per side.

I had been in contact with Norcal Approach most of my flight from JAQ. Just before this point approach informed me of IFR traffic in the vicinity of LVK and to stay clear of it. I asked if an alternate route was advised; approach did not suggest one. I don't remember exactly what they said. I feel it worthy to note that 1-3 miles before reaching VPALT the aircraft magnetic compass started rotating wildly in both directions while my attitude of flight was level and unaccelerated. The Bluetooth GPS (Dual) for my tablet; located in full view of the sky on the dash that I was using for navigation; had also lost its signal. At this point I maintained my heading and used the headings on my flight log and landmarks that I was already familiar with on previous flights to Livermore. The compass regained its sanity a minute or two later; the GPS regained its signal roughly 7-10 miles from LVK. I remember having to force the app (iFlight Planner) on my iPad to close and re-open it. About 10 miles out from LVK I was advised by Approach to contact Livermore Tower. I promptly did so. Tower instructed me to make a right base entry for a 2-mile final to Runway 25R. I had the airport in sight. Being aware of IFR traffic on the approach path I stayed north of Highway 580 until I was two miles out and proceeded to turn base (heading 160 roughly). Tower then proceeded to advise me saying 'what I'm going to have you do is..' or something to that effect and gave me a list of at least three instructions that were difficult to make out due to noise and the rapidity he gave them. I made out 'left turn' and 'follow Cessna' and couldn't understand why I would be directed to turn head-on into approaching traffic so I missed the rest of the details and I informed Tower that I didn't understand; I was also occupied with planning my turn to final and seeing and avoiding traffic. Tower then immediately asked me to turn east and I promptly did so. Soon after Tower asked me if I saw the Cessna. I saw it at my 10 o-clock on the approach to 25R in roughly 300 feet at my altitude. Fortunately the approaching Cessna was descending on final while I maintained the TPA of 1;400 feet. It was under me by the time our ground paths intersected at which point I reported that it was under me. I was then instructed to follow it. At this point I had to make a 160 degree right turn to make final and I was already past the approach path for 25R. I made a hard right turn lowering the nose. Tower informed me that I had crossed the approach path of 25L inappropriately. I was able to recover to a proper approach path and I had the Cessna in sight on final ahead and below me. Tower informed the Cessna that I was close behind on final. The Cessna announced a go-around. I continued my approach and landed uneventfully. Contributing Factors: I was in a critical phase of flight nearly needing to turn final when Tower advised me of his plans. I may have understood incorrectly but what I heard seemed inconsistent with safety and normal pattern procedures when on right-base. I was fully expecting to turn right not left or east first. Flying east on a 250 approach (160 R turn) made the turn to final dangerous and avoidance of the 25L approach path impossible. I figure a 45 degree angle ideal and 90 degrees the maximum. I'm not certain but it's possible that Tower instructed me to 'REPORT 2-mile base for 25R' but I didn't hear the report part and that; while I was still on the same transponder code assigned by Approach and not instructed to squawk VFR; LVK Tower may not be equipped with radar making them unaware of my position unless I reported it. I assumed Tower was aware of my position. I may have missed the report instruction because of the compass and GPS events but I do recall the Controller speaking too quickly and in a muffled tone. It's not the first time that I've heard controllers sound likethey have marbles in their mouths. No offense but for those that don't hear this muffled fast language every day it may as well be Greek at times. My past two experiences at Livermore several months ago were very easy approaches. Tower instructed me to make straight-in approaches and the worst that was unexpected was a last-minute runway change which I handled just fine. So the different VFR approach and IFR traffic definitely tested my metal and I think the Controller's as well. I also didn't have much recent flying time within the last 90 days; though I had last flown a local flight at JAQ just over two months prior. I give the Tower Controller credit for staying with me; queuing me to look for the Cessna I was supposed to follow.",,,,"A pilot reported a near miss in the LVK traffic pattern after he became confused by ATC's instructions to establish him in the traffic pattern and he could not get timely clarification.",

About 5 seconds later; at about 500 feet AGL; saw smoke coming into the cockpit through the vent on the dash. I turned immediately; called an emergency; and tear-dropped with power in to land on the opposite runway I had just taken off from. Once I saw I was high enough to glide in; I pulled power to idle and lowered the nose to try and put the fire out. I decided to leave the engine running as I was over a congested area with housing tracts below; and decided it would be more dangerous to try and make an emergency landing off airport than to leave engine on and fly back to airport as I was only maybe half a mile away. The smoke dissipated by the time I landed; and I taxied quickly back to the terminal where I shut down and exited the aircraft. Upon investigation and talking to the mechanics who inspected the aircraft; it turned out the muffler's back end had blown off; directing all the extremely hot exhaust gases towards the firewall; where the battery and other electrical components were; which was what started the fire. According to the mechanics; when the aircraft was bought the pre-buy inspection did not inspect the muffler well enough as there would have been cracks in the muffler; indicating a potentiality for a malfunction. I felt that my training really prepared me to deal with this emergency in a timely and professional manner.

Enroute to CKB at 6;500 FT; I checked weather information at nearby airports in the mountains for ceiling information. Most of the stations were reporting either clear below 12;000; or broken at 10;000. I made a PIREP to report that it was in fact overcast at 7;000. On the ground at CKB; I checked the weather again and observed the same ceiling information; either broken at 10 or clear below 12 thousand. I decided to use 6;500 FT to fly back; knowing the ceiling was at 7;000. After taking off; I saw the ceiling had dropped below 7;000; so I decided to climb to 11;500 to climb over the clouds. Upon reaching 11;300 FT; I experienced a loss of RPM and determined it to be carburetor icing. I applied carburetor heat and completed the necessary checklist items. Because I did not have full RPM; I was unable to maintain altitude and initiated a descent. I advised Washington Center that I was descending and wasn't sure what altitude I would level out at; but I would let him know. During my descent; I turned to the south and found a gap in the clouds. This gap required a steep descent to prevent from going into IMC. During the descent; I tried my best to maintain the VFR Cloud Separation Minimums; and was in VMC the entire time. When I leveled out below the cloud layer; Washington Center advised me that he had lost radar contact. I notified him that I would be diverting to a nearby airport. Also; my engine had returned to normal. Washington Center asked me if 'I could see the ground'. I responded 'Yes' and that I was about '600 FT below the clouds'. Washington Center then asked if I could go IFR. I responded that I couldn't. Then Washington Center said something along the lines of 'ok; you're IFR but the aircraft isn't?' I responded that it was 'the other way around' and that I was not IFR rated. Washington Center than asked for an aircraft at another local airport to report the ceiling at their location. This ceiling information differed from the location that I was at. After experiencing carburetor icing and performing a descent; I leveled out at a safe altitude below the clouds. I never went into IMC; and maintained VFR to the best of my ability. The carb heat worked as it should have; and the engine came back to normal. The flight resumed as normal. The reason I am filing this report is because while I descended through a gap in the clouds; I may not have been exactly 2;000 FT horizontal; 500 FT below; and 1;000 FT above the clouds; but I was in VMC and never went into IMC. I don't know why Washington Center asked so many questions; but I felt they were irrelevant and distracting.

I leveled off at 2;000 FT. At this point in the flight; no problems had been detected. Shortly after leveling off; the RPM very suddenly began alternating between the cruise setting I had set and an idle throttle setting. I immediately turned towards ZZZ and used the surges of power to climb as much as possible. I attempted to troubleshoot the problem by activating carb heat (and leaving it applied full for the duration of the flight); applying full throttle; selecting left and right mags and enriching the mixture. None of these resulted in a significant improvement. At this time I advised Approach of this emergency. The maximum altitude was 2;900 FT. Approach requested I squawk a discrete code (in the 7700 range). I complied but I was too low for radar contact. I was instructed to switch frequencies and speak to Center. I advised Approach that I was unable to comply; since by this time I was using my free hand to pump the primer to maintain altitude. I asked Approach to call ahead to ZZZ since I was unable to change the frequency to advise traffic of my approach. I was advised that they would do this and that the ground crew would be standing by. Maintaining altitude became impossible. However; sufficient altitude remained such that landing at ZZZ was successful. The cause of the mechanical problem has yet to be determined. While carb icing may be a possibility; no decrease in performance during cruise was evident prior to the very significant RPM fluctuations. Also applying carb hear did not cause any noticeable change; such as rough running or backfire.",,,,"C150 pilot experiences surging engine at 2;000 FT and is able to divert to a nearby airport before the engine quits completely.",

I was instructor pilot; passenger was a relatively new student pilot. Closest weather reporting station reported as follows: METAR ZZZ 24XA53Z 00000KT 10SM SCT013 BKN018 OVC036 16/14 A2992. The forecast was for improving conditions throughout the morning and the rest of the day. Before preflight; before taxi; and before takeoff while lined up on the departure runway; we paused to consider the weather. The lowest clouds looked lower than the report (referenced above); which is 6.7 NM to the north. My experience at departure airport is that if you can see daylight clearly between the hills that are approximately 8 miles to the south and the clouds above them; you have a good straight-out departure path during which you can maintain VFR. While this airport lies within the Class E airspace extension; the extension ends less than a mile south. In other words; taking off to the south; you are in Class G airspace almost immediately. In Class G airspace at or below 1;200 FT AGL; VFR minimums require only 'clear of clouds.' The weather south of the hills was much higher than on our side (north) of the hills; which is not uncommon when the weather is relatively stable (little or no wind). In my judgment; we had a departure path in which we could maintain VFR clear of clouds until south of the hills. I was wrong. The scud was lower than it appeared from the ground; and much lower than indicated by the METAR. We were close to entering clouds shortly after takeoff. I thought I saw an opening to the left (southeast); so we turned in that direction; which is consistent with the normal departure pattern. Within a few seconds; it was apparent that it wasn't as open as it appeared. There was more scud hidden behind and above the scud we were avoiding in order to maintain VFR. I then made the decision to return to the airport and land. This naturally took more scud running at low altitudes; perhaps 800-1000 MSL; as we navigated towards the north (upwind); then crosswind; downwind; base; and final; to land on the normal landing rwy. (Takeoffs to the south; landings to the north are the norm here.) Not only was this unsafe due to the low altitudes and proximity to clouds; it may have been in inadvertent violation of the FAR's due to the low altitudes and no-longer VFR 'clear of clouds' since we necessarily re-entered the Class E airspace extension in order to fly the traffic pattern and land. We landed safely; parked the airplane; went to a nearby restaurant for breakfast; then returned to the airport for another look (in addition to checking the new METAR; which was essentially unchanged: METAR ZZZ 24XC53Z 00000KT 10SM SCT013 BKN018 OVC036 17/14 A2992). Visually; the weather at and to the south was much better than about 2 hours earlier. Other airplanes were flying in the local area and seemed to have no trouble maintaining VFR at safe and legal altitudes. We preflight again; took the runway; considered the weather; then took off and flew to our destination safely and legally. Moral: Don't take chances. If you have to wait; wait. We wanted to catch the early seminars at the Annual Convention at ZZZ; which we missed by departing later than planned. Big deal. There will be other conventions and other seminars. If there is any doubt; wait it out.

The airplane I fly has sparse engine instrumentation so I lean it while listening for an RPM drop then enriched slightly for best power. The radio was tuned to the [departure airport] CTAF and the frequency was busy with chatter from surrounding non-towered fields. So in order to better hear the engine I turned the volume on the radio down completely. While continuing to climb I was observing the scattered cloud layer below becoming denser and the visibility deteriorating. I decided land at [an alternate airport] which was less than 10 miles away instead of continuing to [the planned destination airport]. [The alternate airport] is my home base and I had flown from there earlier in the day. At 7 miles out I tuned the Tower frequency and attempted to make radio contact. I broadcasted my location and landing intentions. There was no response. I attempted one additional time to raise the Tower on the radio. Again no response. I was unsure whether the communication failure was due to a radio malfunction or perhaps that the Tower had closed early. It was [a holiday] so even though my preflight briefing did not mention early Tower closure I saw it as a possibility. I thought maybe the briefer had overlooked it. Since the radio had been functioning all day I concluded that the most likely scenario was that the Tower had closed early due to the holiday. I proceeded to approach the airport as I would a non-towered field. I made frequent position reports and entered the traffic pattern on a left downwind for Runway XX. While in the pattern I watched the Tower for light gun signals and did not see any; this seemed to confirm my suspicion that the Tower was closed. I made position reports on every leg of the pattern and proceeded to land on Runway XX. While taxiing back to the parking area an FBO employee intercepted me and directed me to park at the FBO. During shutdown I was turning off the avionics and finally the problem became apparent; I had never turned the radio volume back up. Once I stopped the engine he advised me that I was to call the Tower. After mentally reviewing the incident I realized that it was immediately after setting the mixture that I decided to divert because of the weather. My mind was switching gears from one task to the next and I simply neglected to turn the radio back up. I did not thoroughly troubleshoot the issue because the holiday provided what seemed like a reasonable explanation for not hearing a response on the radio. I am not sure what can be done to prevent someone else from making this error. I do know for sure that I will never make it again.",,,,"The pilot of a C150 lowered the volume on the communication panel to better hear the engine during mixture adjustment; but then neglected to recognize it resulting in the inability to hear Tower communications.

On the previous two uneventful test flights; two occupants of the same C-150 had worn standard emergency aircraft parachutes and had experimented with the ability to open and close the passenger door in flight; without having it removed. On this third flight; the pilot wore a standard emergency parachute and the brief flight test was to have the right seat occupant wear a standard sport single harness dual parachute system; and test the required space requirements; the amount of force required to open the door; and the possible body exit positions. During the process of maneuvering with the door open; the passenger's main pilot chute accidentally became dislodged and was pulled aft by airflow; and could not be retracted. The passenger elected to depart the aircraft to avoid potential imminent entanglement of the main parachute with the right horizontal stabilizer of the C-150. Upon deployment; the main canopy of the passenger was open but was twisted; and the pilot chute had wrapped around the left steering line; which caused a hard left turn and loss of altitude. The passenger did not use his reserve canopy as he estimated that he was too low. The passenger landed in a grass area in a partially controlled left turn and was unable to flare normally. This otherwise normal flight test became an in flight emergency due to the uncommanded inadvertent release of the passenger's main canopy pilot chute; and the relatively low altitude of the aircraft. As a result of this problem; it has been determined that there is not enough cabin space to use the C-150 as a jump aircraft and that the possibility of [accidental] parachute [deployment] is too great for this aircraft type in standard configuration.",,,,"A passenger; wearing a standard sport dual parachute; in the right seat of a C-150 was obligated to jump out in flight when the main chute pilot exited the pack and was threatening to entangle with the right stabilizer.

I noticed a sudden loss of engine RPM. I responded by immediately pushing the mixture control to full rich mixture. The engine responded by increasing RPM back to my cruise power setting. After a few seconds the engine lost power again and I applied full carburetor heat. The engine RPM stabilized but full power was not being produced. I decided to turn towards the nearest airport; ZZZ Municipal. As I turned towards ZZZ the engine power began to fluctuate between roughly 1;100 RPM and 2;000 RPM despite the mixture being full rich; full carb heat; and throttle open roughly half way. I had been receiving VFR radar advisories/flight following from ATC and immediately declared an emergency when the RPM began to fluctuate. I checked my fuel valve was open; mixture rich; carb heat on; magnetos on both; and primer locked. Engine gauges were normal. I briefed my passenger on an emergency landing (seat belts secure; doors ajar; evacuate when stopped) and positioned myself over ZZZ Airport and ran the engine failure checklists. While in contact with ATC I squawked 7700 and advised [them] I expected a normal landing on runway at ZZZ. ATC approved a changed of frequency to the CTAF. At 4;300 FT I brought the throttle to idle and announced my intentions on the CTAF. An aircraft holding short of the runway said they would hold in position and assist me if needed after landing and would monitor my descent and watch for traffic. I established best glide speed; briefed my passenger again and continued my descent. At 1;800 FT on a downwind leg abeam the numbers I lowered 20 degrees flaps. At 1;200 FT I lowered 40 degrees flaps and turned base. I turned a short final and applied a forward slip. I told my passenger 'Doors ajar!' and stated I thought we might go off the end of the runway. I touched down halfway down the runway and made a normal landing. My passenger and I smelled smoke. I turned the aircraft onto Taxiway A and said 'Evacuate!' I got out of the plane with the fire extinguisher. No fire or smoke was observed. I called ATC on the phone and said we were landed safe in ZZZ. The plane was towed to a maintenance shop on the airport. The mechanic thought the engine was having carburetor problems. This was my first real engine failure. I handled it identically to my engine out training flights with my CFI. My handling of the situation was 'textbook' in that I remembered every step of the Emergency Checklist; communicated effectively with ATC; briefed my passenger; stayed calm; and landed safely. I credit my training; my CFI; regular engine out practice; and thorough pre-flight planning and route selection. The one thing I could have done better was make 1 more revolution above the airport before turning base. This would have ensured a landing with more runway available for roll out.

I had forgotten that my son wanted me to take him and his 22-month old son for an airplane ride. Right after securing the airplane; they arrived at the FBO. After taking care of the student's post flight procedures; I brought my son and grandson to the airplane. Having just flown the airplane; I did not do a new preflight inspection; but asked my son; who had also learned to fly in this airplane to untie the tie-downs; etc.The little guy was somewhat apprehensive about the whole affair; and was scared when the control yoke moved so quickly during the 'flight controls; free and correct' sequence. This may have diverted my attention causing me to miss the normal check of the rudder right and left. After calling Ground Control; we taxied to the runway.The wind was about 4 or 5 knots; pretty well aligned with the runway. After takeoff the airplane climbed straight ahead just as one would normally expect. I found myself doing a mental check-up if everything had been taken care off. I asked my son if he had removed the rudder lock. He indicated he didn't know what I was referring to. When he had learned to fly; we had not installed this home-made rudder lock as part of our normal routine. He looked back at the vertical fin; and could see the wooden rudder lock was still in place. Of course I wondered how serious a control problem this would be; but started a gentle climbing right turn. Everything continued to feel almost normal; the ball stayed centered; etc. We entered a right downwind for the runway. I wondered how much control would be affected at lower power settings; but continued the normal pattern; and landed safely right on the centerline without any control problems. After having given thousands of hours of flight instruction; always emphasizing the importance of a through preflight inspection; the proper use of checklists; and not trusting crucial elements to others; I had actually taken off with a rudder lock installed! Ironically; there was nothing about the flight control characteristics that alerted me to the problem. This could be because the steerable nose wheel still works while the rudder is immobilized; and there was a little movement of the rudder underneath the installed boards on each side of the vertical fin and rudder. Still; this could have been a very serious problem if there had been a strong cross wind to contend with. What did I learn? Always recheck the most crucial items of the preflight inspection. It's okay to use a trained helper for some things; but 'Trust but verify!' I should have done at least a 'walk-around' myself. Even under excellent conditions be sure to cover every item of the checklist thoroughly.

I established visual with the prior airplane which was 5+ miles ahead and no factor. Shortly after this a third airplane reported as a Commander called 6 miles out from OKV on the ILS 32 Approach. The reported position at the time put the Commander behind me by approximately 2 miles. No communication was ever established with the Commander. When I was 3 miles out from OKV established on the ILS 32 Approach the Commander reported 4 miles out. Again I inquired if the Commander had traffic ahead of them in sight. Again; there was no reply. Immediately after this the traffic ahead of me landed and advised they would need to roll to the end of the runway due to spongy brakes. I was still looking for the airplane trailing me (the Commander) and lifted my right wing and saw the Commander at my 5 o'clock position just 30-40 FT away and 10-15 FT above. I immediately turned left; descended and reduced power. No contact was ever established with the Commander. They must have seen my evasive maneuvering; because they turned the opposite direction and left the area.I had in continuous operation all 3 navigation position lights; red anti-collision beacon; wingtip mounted white anti-collision strobes and LED landing light. Post flight checks verified all external lights were operational. In my opinion there is no reason the Commander airplane could not see my airplane unless they were simply not looking for me.

I was on a flight at 5;500 feet MSL when the engine began to run rough. Although the humidity was low; I suspected it could be carburetor ice. I applied carburetor heat with negative results. Having leaned the mixture for flight at 5;500 feet I enriched the mixture to full rich again having no effect on the rough running engine. I reduced the throttle and the engine almost completely stopped running. I immediately went back to full throttle. The engine was now beginning to get worse and I was experiencing a loss in RPM's and altitude as a result. Knowing I could make it; I had decided to turn the airplane 180 degrees and go back to airport. I contacted Approach and notified them of the problem which continued to get worse and that I was going back to land. They informed me they contacted the Tower to let them know of my situation. I told Approach that I was going to maintain as much altitude as possible to assure I could make the airport. I was then asked if I wanted to declare an emergency to which I replied yes; and 3 hours of fuel and 1 person on board. I was told by Approach that I could contact the Control Tower; and the Tower cleared me for landing. I maintained as much altitude as possible to assure making the airport. At about three miles out and about 3;000 feet the Tower cleared me for any maneuver and to land on any runway. Now knowing I would make the airport I began to slip the aircraft. During this maneuver the engine began to almost run as if nothing was wrong which seemed very strange to me. After landing and taxiing off the runway I was surprised that the engine was now running like normal. I contacted Ground; continued to the run-up area with emergency equipment following me. I shut down and was met by fire equipment and the police. After explaining my situation and presenting the requested documents; I started up the engine which again to my surprise; everything seemed normal. I proceeded to parking and began to evaluate the problem to the best of my ability. I called my A&P to explain the situation so we could try and analyze the situation over the phone. While talking to him I checked for water in the fuel tanks. Having already done this during my preflight inspection and not finding any; I was surprised to find that here was indeed some water in the tanks. I checked the fuel strainer; holding the cup used to check the tanks so I could measure the amount; if any; of water in the strainer. I was shocked to get about 7 ounces of water from the strainer before getting fuel. I mentioned to my A&P that he needed to get in touch with the Airport Manager where I last purchased fuel to check their avgas tank for water and contamination. I was hoping that no others would be in jeopardy having topped off their aircraft. They contacted me a while later and said they had pumped out about 10 gallons from the only avgas fuel tank on the airport and found no water in the fuel. I'm certain that the water in the fuel on my aircraft was the problem but am completely mystified along with others as to where it came from. I left the aircraft with the intention of checking it out more thoroughly before flying it home the following Saturday. I topped off the tanks so there would be little space for condensation to develop. I was unable to retrieve the aircraft the following Saturday because of weather and intend to do so this Saturday; weather permitting. Knowing the aircraft is mechanically sound; I intend to check the fuel tanks and strainer for any water and then do a 15 to 20 minute run-up. Afterwards; if everything appears to be normal; I will shut down the engine and again check for any water in the system. If none is found; I intend to do another run-up and then fly it back to home base.",,,,"During cruise flight the pilot of a Cessna 150 experienced degraded engine performance bordering on failure; declared an emergency; and with assistance from ATC completed a successful emergency landing at a nearby airport.

Just before take-off a change was made so that my aircraft would become the third in a heat of four aircraft that would be making circuits in the pattern around the airfield. The original plan was for my aircraft to be number one in a heat of two. Upon reaching the end of Runway XX there were two aircraft from the heat before us waiting for take-off clearance. The four aircraft were notified that the two heats of two aircraft would be combined to one heat of four just before take-off via tower frequency. I did not know of this change until the second of the four aircraft were departing. Realizing I had mis-dialed the Tower frequency; I changed to the proper frequency and realized the change to the number of aircraft in the heat. I quickly acknowledged the change and took Runway XX to depart about 45 seconds behind the aircraft ahead. Aircraft in the pattern were calling mid-field downwind for landing clearance. After my second landing of three I heard what I thought was the aircraft ahead call mid-field downwind as I was crossing the end of runway XX on an upwind. I proceeded to turn crosswind and the tower controller notified me that I had turned ahead of the aircraft that was ahead of me in the heat. I quickly spotted the aircraft about 300 feet above and 200 feet out to my 11 o clock.

Upon completion of the first pass; I maintained position of the upwind until the preceding aircraft was off my right wing on the downwind to ensure adequate spacing between us for the following pass. The preceding aircraft called midfield downwind for Runway XX as I began my turn from upwind to crosswind for the same runway. Upon turning onto downwind I observed the aircraft following mine abeam my right wing and about 200 ft below my position; and began to initiate a climb away from the other aircraft. Tower informed both aircraft of our proximity to each other; and as both aircraft verbally communicated that they had visual upon the other I maintained my altitude and continued with the pattern.",,"C150 pilot reports losing track of the C172 ahead in the traffic pattern and turning crosswind too early resulting in a NMAC.

As I cleaned up my aircraft it appeared this is when the other aircraft; a Cessna single; seemed to have noticed me as he pitched up and banked hard to the left. It was hard to be sure; but it looked as though he entered an accelerated stall and made a single rotation of spin and came down to my altitude somewhere behind me. I lost visual at this time and began to climb back to 2500 feet. Continued flight and landed at as planned. There was a slight haze below and a low ceiling of about 1200 AGL. So all the VFR traffic seems to have been in the same altitude space as it was the only compromise of altitude safety and vertical clearance and visibility. Because of the haze; visual distance was not very good and most of the state was MVFR with an expectation that it would improve in the evening. I was very lucky that I had contacted approach.

Approximately 20 miles east of the airport; while I was at 6;500 feet altitude; NORCAL advised me that flight following was terminated and squawk 1200. I descended to 1300 feet (approximate TPA for E16) over the private golf course; which is a well-established landmark three miles north of the airport; known to most pilots at South County Airport; as a landmark used to announce 45 degree entry for right downwind for E16 Runway 32. At this point; I heard another pilot announce that he was 'downwind' runway 32 in a Cessna airplane.Realizing that another airplane was maneuvering in the pattern; I proceeded to clearly announce my position; numerous times; over the course of the next five minutes...At no time did I hear the pilot of the other airplane make any announcement; other than the initial report of downwind when I was still over the golf course. I did not observe the airplane on the ground. Since it had been so long since I heard from the other airplane; I assumed he had either landed or left the vicinity. I assumed that if I was announcing my position; and if the other pilot made no attempt to announce his position; then the other airplane must not be a factor.At this time; a third airplane; announced that he was north of the airport and entering a right 45 for runway 32. Less than .25 mile from the approach end of the runway; on my short final; 30 degrees flaps; I saw the wings of another high wing airplane appear beneath me. He was maybe 30 feet below me and traveling slightly faster than me; so he was maybe 30 feet in front of me when I saw him. He must have been directly underneath me before he finally overtook me and I was able to see him.I became extremely agitated and shouted over the radio 'There's another airplane; near collision; going around!' I applied full power; climbed; and veered right slightly so that I could see the other airplane in my sight. The third airplane; said over the radio 'what happened?' I was still agitated and said 'some idiot just pulled out in front of me.' The pilot of the airplane that nearly hit me remained silent. I engaged in a heated discussion with the other airplane in the pattern and warned him about a reckless pilot who was now taxiing on the ground. At this point -- finally -- the pilot of [the offending Cessna] spoke up and said he was unaware of any near collision; and that he had 'announced' his position clearly. The other pilot [in the pattern] said 'I never heard you say anything; pal.' On the ground the pilot of [the offending Cessna]; who was still on the taxiway; contacted me by radio; and asked to come over to speak with me. I said OK. As I was tying down my airplane; he came over; shook my hand; but insisted that he had communicated clearly; and that he never saw me. He also at one point told me he was 'doing touch and go's' and 'was the only plane in the pattern.' He then got back in his plane; and departed runway 32 heading north.",,"I was involved in an almost mid air collision while on final approach at South County Airport (E16) in San Martin; CA. I was practicing landings; flew the second traffic pattern. While flying on the downwind leg for runway 32 I realized another airplane [was] entering the pattern on the right 45. A third aircraft was also in the pattern; following me and the other plane involved. I announced each traffic pattern leg on the radio; also hearing the other 2 planes. While I was on final approach I heard the plane behind me announcing that he is turning base. My thoughts were that this plane is following me pretty close. All the sudden I heard another pilot cursing on the radio; warning the 3rd guy that he almost had a mid air collision. I finished my landing without noticing anything of an incident. After taxiing off the runway I heard the involved pilot and the pilot of the third plane talking to each other on the radio. Just at that time I realized that they were actually talking about me and that it has been my plane that was involved in this incident. I taxied to the parking area and the other pilot parked his plane too. We talked to each other and he told me that he all the sudden saw me about 50 feet below him. Since I was the lower plane and was on final approach I had the right of way. Obviously the other pilot was flying the base leg closer to the runway than me. I had no chance seeing him; as I am in a high wing airplane and he was approaching from the blind spot over my wings to the right. On the other hand I cannot understand how he could not see me while he was on the base leg. He was flying a high wing aircraft too; a Cessna 150 or 152. He must have looked only to the right; direction runway; so he did not see me on final approach from the left. The pilot told me that he did not hear me on the radio; but I announced each and every leg. Before and after this incident I had no problem communicating with ATC. So I assume my radio working fine; as I could also hear the other pilots in the pattern talking. Maybe his volume was set too low. Anyway; even without radio I was flying all the time right in front of him; so I really cannot understand how this incident happened.",,"Reports from both pilots of an NMAC event at non-towered E16 provide classic narratives of the same event seen from different points of view...and cockpits.",

Due to the high utilization of the Cessna 150 involved; the sole pilot and owner sought relief from the 100 hour inspection requirement. Approved AMOC L115W-11-986 extends the sub-annual inspection interval to 220 hours for aircraft not involved in for-hire or flight instruction ops (such as this aircraft). The individual owner and operator of the Cessna 150 sought to apply this AMOC (originally from the Cessna Aircraft Company).AD2011-10-09 includes the statement 'Before using any approved AMOC; notify your appropriate principal inspector; or lacking a principal inspector; the manager of the local flight standards district office/certificate holding district office.' As directed in the AD; and following a phone call with the local FSDO stating his intent; the owner then proceeded to fax a letter to the manager of the aircraft's FSDO stating his application of the AMOC to the airframe involved. Having notified the FSDO of his application of the approved AMOC; the owner then proceeded to operate the aircraft beyond 100 hours between seat rail inspections (but less than 220 hours). A subsequent phone call with the FSDO approximately 10 months later revealed that the owner or responsible Maintenance Technician should have received a letter approving the application of the AMOC from the FSDO before the aircraft changes its maintenance schedule. The aircraft had just had the necessary inspections detailed in the AD performed. As a corrective action going forward; the owner will comply with the AD as written (inspect every 100 hours) unless a letter specifically authorizing an alternative compliance is in hand.A contributing factor to this oversight was a lack of clear requirements for AMOC application in either the AD or the approved AMOC itself. AD's state that operators must notify the appropriate FSDO; but do not state that an official letter or paperwork must be received and on-hand prior to transferring/applying an already approved AMOC.",,,,"A pilot owner-operator reported that he had advised the FAA Flight Standard District Office of the desire to apply an Alternate Means of Compliance for an Airworthiness Directive.

I performed some pattern work and landings at my home airport; then decided to fly south to the Class D airport adjacent to the city I live near.  This airport is situated in a river valley; and is hemmed in by large hills with several residential neighborhoods.  It is also just underneath the approach path of the Class B airport just 5 miles away.     I performed one full stop landing at this airport.  On the downwind leg and cleared to land; I pulled power back; entered my first 10 degrees of flaps and began my descent.  Turning onto the base leg; I noticed I was descending a little steeper than I was comfortable with; so I added some power.  The tower called me to point out traffic inbound to land on the parallel runway.  I started to fixate between my runway; and the parallel landing traffic and allowed my altitude to deteriorate further.  I suddenly saw trees and a couple houses close below me; but before I could add power; the hill dropped away to the valley floor.  Even after this; I was still above the visual glideslope of my runway; so I calmed myself down enough to land; then taxi back for departure.  The tower never pointed out any problems.  There are a couple flight schools on the field; so maybe this is not an unusual occurrence.Normally; I have no problem flying into this airport.  However; I should have respected that my skills would become rusty after 6 months away.  I fixated far too long on the other traffic as well as my runway and allowed my scan to deteriorate to the point that I did not notice my altitude.  I should have waited a little while longer to turn base where the hill dips lower; or perhaps not began my descent until I was established on the base leg.  Even though the tower did not call me out; and I still ended up above the glideslope; I should have been more careful and perhaps waited until I had regained enough proficiency before returning to this airport.",,,,"A C150 pilot reports completing a currency check with his flight club after 6 months away from flying.

I landed; shut down the airplane and called FSS on my phone to get a weather briefing for the remainder of my flight.  I waited until the top of the hour when the new weather advisories were issued.  With good VFR conditions for the route; I conducted a quick preflight and prepared to depart for [home].During the start checklist I gave the engine a pump of primer.  While cranking the engine for start there were no signs of it firing or turning over.  I waited about 30 seconds and tried again without priming; as the engine was still warm from the prior flight.  Again; there were no signs that the engine would start.  I then waited over a minute; and leaned the mixture and advanced the throttle before another attempt; suspecting that the engine may have been flooded.  I cranked again and the engine sounded like it was going to start but never did.Shortly after this and while awaiting another try; I noticed some smoke near the front of the cowling.  Although I couldn't see any visible flames; I pulled out the mixture control and cranked the engine with the throttle full open as a precaution for an engine fire.  I also moved the fuel shutoff up to the closed position as best as I could; although it appeared jammed and was extremely difficult to turn.  When I got out of the airplane I noticed a small fire burning on the nose wheel.  I went back to the cabin to search for a fire extinguisher but couldn't find one.  Upon going back to the front of the airplane I noticed that there was also a small fire in the air inlet/filter.  My reaction at this point was to call 911 for help.  I removed a few personal belongings and assured that the switches were off.A police officer arrived in about 5 minutes and handed me a fire extinguisher from his vehicle; which ended up not spraying as it needed to be recharged.  The fire department arrived in the next 5 minutes and the fire was still burning in the engine cowling.  While they were preparing to put out the fire; the engine started to crank for no apparent reason; which seemed strange since everything had been turned off.  This happened for almost a minute with the engine never actually starting; until they sprayed the cowling with water to extinguish the fire.Considerations- Considering the earlier weather at my destination; it was a non-rushed evening and I wasn't hurried.- I had started the airplane three other times that day.

On my last landing (which was a 3 point landing dead on center-line) during the roll-out I failed to maintain directional control using left rudder to counteract weathervaning which caused the plane to ground loop. The winds were coming from the west at 280/13 KTS and the airport was landing aircraft on 180. This was a direct crosswind. I have done training before with winds much higher than this. However; after 5 months absence my skill level declined and I was not quick enough to respond to the relative high crosswinds. (However; the Cessna 120 does not have a designated crosswind limit since it was manufactured in the 1940s) In the future; I will retrain with winds more benign than the ones that were present on the day of this incident.Very minor damage occurred to the L wing tip and no bodily injuries occurred.

The flight was a personal flight. I had filed and opened a VFR flight plan using commercially available flight planning software.  The engine start; run-up; taxi; and takeoff all were normal.  I climbed to 3500 FT MSL and leveled off where I leaned the engine mixture and set engine RPM to 2400.  Engine oil pressure and temperature were noted as well within the 'green arc'. While still in the cruise configuration the engine without warning had a significant loss of engine RPM accompanied by a severe engine vibration.  I immediately place the mixture to 'full rich'; applied full power and carburetor heat.  With the engine controls set in this configuration the engine was producing about 1500 RPM. I slowed the aircraft to approximately 60 KIAS; but the engine vibration remained severe; making it difficult to read the flight instruments.  At this point we were in about a 500 FPM rate of descent.  I quickly ascertained the nearest suitable airport.  I set up a course direct and made a distress call 'in the blind' on 121.5 while descending through 3000 FT MSL.  I then set the carburetor heat to off; which had no impact on engine operation so I elected to leave it in the off position.  I then attempted to lean the engine fuel mixture; which only further reduced engine RPM.  I quickly placed the mixture to 'full rich'.  I did not adjust carb heat or engine fuel mixture for the remainder of the flight.  The engine was producing approximately 1500 RPM with the severe vibration still present.  The airspeed was still about 60 KIAS and the rate of descent remained relatively steady at approximately 500 FPM.   My distress call on 121.5 was heard by what was an unknown aircraft or agency in the area.  They advised me they were relaying my report of engine trouble; approximate location; aircraft type and people on board.  Descending through 2000 FT MSL; it was apparent that making it to the airport was not going to be possible.  I made another distress call advising of my attempt to land in an open field and gave my grid coordinates.  I am not sure that this call was received by or relayed to any agency.  As I was making the distress call I made a right hand turn toward the East to find a suitable landing area while still maintaining about 60 KIAS.  Again; exact speed was difficult to ascertain due to engine vibration.  I continued my right hand turn to the South as this put us in a direction for the most suitable landing areas and it also placed the aircraft into the predominately southerly wind.  At the completion of the turn the aircraft was at about 1700 FT MSL.  I located one paved road and two gravel roads; but I quickly assessed them as unsuitable due to wires running parallel along them.  My first choice was a roadway or other hard packed area. Upon realizing that the roads were not a possibility I selected a large grassy field that was free of obstacles; relatively flat and was obtainable by our glide path.  The field also provided a paved highway and a house near by that I was hoping would offer easier access by Emergency Services should they be needed.  Descending through 1400 FT MSL and on a Southerly heading; I determined our glide path made making the field a certainty.  At about this same point the engine quit producing any power which had little effect on our flight at this point as the intended landing spot was assured.  Nearing the field I began to slow the aircraft in order to clear a terrace in the field and to allow the aircraft to touchdown as slow as possible.  Once clear of the terrace the aircraft touched down in the field.  Immediately the landing gear began to 'dig in'.  As the nose wheel dug into the soil; our momentum caused the aircraft to flip about its nose onto its back. The aircraft immediately came to a stop.  Once stopped; I assessed myself as ok and turned off the master power switch and magneto key switch.I opened the door on my side; released my seatbelt and exited the aircraft.  I then ran to the passenger side; opened the passenger door and helped the passenger exit as well.  We then moved to the west side of the aircraft about 30 yards away.  I didn't detect any fuel spillage so I returned to the aircraft to recover my cellular phone in order to contact emergency personnel.  At about the same time the residents of the nearby house arrived on their ATVs; offered assistance and advised that they had contacted emergency services.  Within just a few minutes I received a phone call from the local FSDO advising me they had received my distress call and offered assistance. I advised them that we did not require any more assistance and that our flight plan could be closed out. Emergency personnel arrived and we declined any medical assistance.  The FAA contacted me and directed me on how to secure the aircraft and that we were released from the scene.  My passenger and I were transported by EMS personnel to their station where family members met us to transport us home.",,,,"Cessna 150 pilot experienced a complete engine failure and landed the aircraft in a field.",

I was in cruise flight about to descend to the OFP traffic pattern for Runway 16. I was monitoring Potomac Approach on 126.75 but not in contact or receiving traffic advisories from Potomac Approach. The controller was talking to a Boeing 737. The controller called out traffic to the B737 ahead at 3;000 feet. I looked back and there was the B737 at my 5 o'clock position a few hundred feet away at the same altitude. I immediately descended and turned to the left and observed the B737 climbing to the right. I was very surprised that such a large aircraft got so close and that they were at such a low altitude so far out from RIC (over 20NM). I would have thought the controller would have vectored the B737 away from my VFR aircraft much earlier. I called the Approach Control Supervisor and was told that this was common altitude that they use for approaches to Runway 16 at RIC.

We were inbound to the airport from the south; and were directed by Tower to enter left traffic for runway 19.At approximately 1400 feet MSL on the descent to traffic pattern altitude (1300 feet); I encountered a loss in RPM of approximately 500-600 RPM. At the time of the power loss; I had full power (2400 RPM) selected. Due to my low proximity to the ground; and the fact that runway 01 was almost directly in front of me; I elected to request a landing straight in to runway 01. I believed it to be carburetor icing; and I applied full carburetor heat. I knew that the carburetor on the O-200 engine on the Cessna 150 is very susceptible to carb icing; and the relative humidity on this day was also unusually high (approx 80%). The conditions to form carburetor icing were set.Following my landing on runway 01; I ran the engine up to full power; and the engine ran smooth; both with carb heat on and off. This confirmed by suspicion of carb ice. We taxied to the transient parking to shut down; and call the flight school to report it. We decided to go to the run up area and do another run up to check engine function. Engine ran fine; both with carb heat on and off. It was determined that the carb ice had been eliminated and the engine was running normally. I've encountered carburetor icing before.

Smell was very faint. During taxi back to runway; smell became slightly more pronounced but still faint. I did not believe that it was coming from the aircraft because we had not smelled it while flying except briefly on short final. I believed it to be coming from an outside source.During takeoff and our left turn out; smell became thicker and stronger. Approximately 2-3 miles south; southwest of the field; I reached to turn off the wing landing/taxi lights. The panel containing the switches for the lights; fuses; and other electrical systems was very hot. I turned off the lights.I then [advised ATC] of possible fire on board; and turned left back to the airport. I was confident that we would be able to make it to the airport with little difficulty. FBO personnel came on frequency and asked if we required a fire truck. I responded yes because I was witnessing faint white smoke drifting from the panel with the lighting switches/fuses. I then turned off the master and alternator. We landed without incident; although we were unable to utilize flaps during our approach due to the master being turned off. I had one window open to vent the smoke in the cabin.After braking hard; I pulled off at the first available taxiway and pulled the mixture to CUT; throttle to IDLE; fuel to OFF; and mags to OFF.

Holding short of runway we completed the run up and no anomalies were seen so we took off; student flying; and headed south until we established contact with Approach. After contact we proceeded on course direct to ZZZ1. [While enroute]; I noticed a random; very light; what seemed to be misfire in the engine. Since it was so cold my first thought went to carb ice. I turned on carb heat and noted the RPM drop but no engine roughness usually associated with carb ice. I then asked my student what airspeed he was maintaining and if he was able to climb. He told me about 60-65 kts and he was only able to maintain altitude with full power. After about 3-5 mins of carb heat and full power; I turned it off and; still and full power; noted the RPM only came up to around 2000; bottom of the green arc. At that point I told my student to head back to ZZZ and I advised Approach of our intentions making a 180 degree turn back. We were cleared as requested and while my student flew; I trouble shot the issue and reviewed the emergency checklists. Not finding any applicable items in the checklists I began leaning the mixture and adjusting the throttle to get any better power. I noticed no RPM climb as I leaned the mixture until I hit engine roughness associated with an excessively lean mixture. I then returned the mixture to full rich and reduced the throttle. When I pulled the throttle about an inch back I noticed the RPM climbed about 200. I elected to leave the throttle there since it was generating the best power. About 2-3 minutes later we got extreme engine roughness that felt like a dead cylinder. At this point I took over flying and [advised] Approach. I then decided that I was going to head for ZZZ2 since [terrain] was between me and ZZZ and the city was between me and ZZZ3 and also not confident that the engine would make it to either airport.

This loss was corrected with the application of intermittent carb heat. As my flight progressed; I needed more frequent application of carb heat and the RPM loss without carb heat became increasingly more pronounced. About 10 minutes after my initial detection of RPM change; the carb icing had become significant enough that the engine would not run without full application of carb heat. At this time I advised ATC that I was descending down to 3;000 feet hoping that the warmer air down lower could improve the situation.I saw no improvement at the lower altitude; but the engine continued to lose power; even with full carb heat applied. Within about 30 seconds after my descent; the engine slowly but steadily lost power and ultimately ceased operation. At this point; I notified ATC that I had an engine failure likely due to carb ice and [requested assistance].After establishing best glide and locating a suitable field for an off airport landing; I attempted to restart the engine. I was concurrently updating ATC of my situation. They offered vectors to [the nearest airport] but it was too far to glide. I advised them that I was continuing to attempt a restart; but was most likely going to make a forced landing in a farmer's field.At approximately 1;000 feet AGL; I successfully restarted the engine and climbed to a safe altitude. I notified ATC that I had restarted the engine and that I planned to circle the field for a few minutes. At this point; I advised them that I no longer needed emergency handling. After about 10 minutes of circling; I determined that the engine was performing without issue. I flew home uneventfully under the watchful eye of [ATC].Upon landing; I called [ATC] to thank them and let them know that I had made it safely home. They advised me that there was nothing else that I needed to do at that point. That evening; I pulled the relevant weather history and determined that at the time of my engine quitting the atmospheric conditions put me in the range of 'serious carb icing at cruise power.' I grounded the plane and reviewed with my mechanic a few days later. He determined that I wasn't aggressive enough with early carb heat and given the favorable conditions and design of the Cessna 150; that I reached a point where I was making carb ice faster than I was able to melt it.In the future; I plan to laminate and keep a copy of a carb ice chart in the airplane and be aware of conditions that are conducive to the formation of carb ice.

The seller had multiple people interested in the plane; and it was first come first serve. I had another pilot who had a VFR only Cessna 150 who offered his airplane for the flight; and was going to fly the plane home if I purchased the new plane. The weather was forecast to be marginal VFR with some IFR along the route; but ceilings of 800-1;000 feet; becoming broken to clear as the day progressed. The weather was forecast to be bad the following day; so I 'had' to take the flight that day.To complicate issues; I needed to get back to pick my son up from school that evening. Needless to say; I had a huge case of get-there-itis clouding my judgment.I spoke to the aircraft seller; he said there was a bit of fog at our destination; but it appeared to be very thin and breaking up.We departed home base in marginal VFR broken conditions. I actually did maintain VFR in the climb on top (barely). We were cruising on top in sunshine and clear skies.I had a portable ADS-B capable GPS unit; and I was paying close attention to the weather enroute. I saw a couple stations near our destination reporting marginal VFR broken conditions; and an airport near the destination was VFR; 10 miles and clear! Perfect! I got lucky! It took me another hour to realize that the VFR airport report was 4 hours old; and was not being updated by ADS-B. Oops! What's more; I had received a weather brief earlier that day; and I supplemented it with my iPad; for whatever reason my weather program was not updating; so I was still on the 4 hour old weather at our departure time.To add insult to injury; this plane literally has no equipment; we had a handheld transceiver and the portable GPS; that was it. We could get 5 miles of range out of the handheld on a good day. At least it had an attitude indicator.So; we're now 2 hours into the flight; I'm waiting for the ADS-B to refresh. Not good; all the areas within range of our fuel supply were reporting overcast ceilings and anywhere from low IFR to 1;000 feet ceilings and 5 miles visibility. We continued another half hour; and I'm literally saying a prayer hoping for a hole. Nothing! We saw an area that looked like an opening; but it was actually an area of ground fog; not good. At this point; the left fuel gauge is bouncing off 'E'. I ask the owner if the fuel gauges were accurate; he assured me they were 'pretty close'. We did find an airport at the very edge of our fuel supply that was reporting 1;000 feet broken ceilings and set course for it. I'm sitting in the plane thinking 'I don't want to get busted for VFR into IMC'! All the while watching the gauge bounce off of 'E' was really unnerving; plus I thought; what if the weather closes in there; then I'm out of gas and have to cobble together an emergency approach.All the while; my mind is starting to race; thinking of what an idiot I was; how do I explain this; the guy with me has a family too; etc. Now I'm going to be a statistic. Then I pulled myself back together; realized that we were in an emergency; and I was landing. I looked at the aircraft owner; and told him that I was taking control of the plane. I was concerned about the possibilities of a mid-air collision; so I abandoned the thought of going to our intended destination; and instead picked an airport well away from a major city that was reporting good visibility below the clouds and (reasonably) high ceilings. I dialed up an RNAV approach on my handheld; switched to UNICOM (figuring I could break things off if I heard another plane on the approach); and into the soup we went.The approach went well; and thankfully the 50 year old altimeter was pretty close. The aircraft owner was pretty well messing himself in the other seat; I had to ignore him and fly the airplane. We broke out of the clouds right at 1;000 feet; and landed safely.We had 3 gallons of fuel remaining; we would have run out had we gone to the other airport. I still am shaking about that a little bit. We waited a couple hours on the ground for conditions to improve; then continued to our destination.Lessons for the day; nothing; and I mean nothing is worth taking a chance like that. Here I am; as a senior pilot and an instructor; supposed to be setting the standard for not taking chances; add a dose of get-there-itis and a weather report from an airplane seller had me blasting off into weather I should never have been in. I wanted to fly the new plane back if I bought it; so we took the owner's marginally equipped plane out on a very marginal day for a long cross country. Not very bright. Had I been in a well equipped airplane; this flight would have been a non-issue. I had multiple IFR capable planes I could've taken.If nothing else; I think I pretty well scared the aircraft owner into upgrading his plane and getting his instrument ticket. Even though he was rated in his plane and was flying; I know he didn't make an objective decision about the weather because he had me with him.We would be dead had I not been rated and current. I have made myself a couple promises out of this; one is 'no long cross countries in a non-IFR plane if I have any; and I do mean any type of schedule to keep'. Another is that 'it can wait;' we flew back in nice VFR conditions later that day. Finally; no marginal IFR in an under equipped airplane; ever. I did buy the plane; once I saw it was IFR equipped and current! I did miss picking up my son from school; however my in-laws picked him up and all worked out anyhow.",,,,"A C150 pilot reported the pressures that led to departing into marginal weather and resulted in a descent through IFR conditions to a precautionary landing for fuel.",

Preflight and run up were fine and I received a taxi clearance to runway 35 at E. After I got to the hold short line; I saw a jet on the south end of the runway which appeared to also be holding short for takeoff; I assumed at A. I received a clearance for takeoff on runway 35 with a right turn out to the south. Tower told me the jet was on the south end of the runway doing engine tests. I took off and due to the strong headwind; was between 400 feet and 500 feet AGL when I was over the end of the runway and turned crosswind. Tower told me to advise when I left class D airspace. I turned downwind about 700 feet to 800 feet AGL about 1/2 to 1 mile east of the runway. Shortly after turning downwind; I thought I detected a slight miss in the engine. Within 2-3 seconds; the engine started running rough and losing RPM. I verified the mixture was all the way in and pulled carb heat in case I was getting carb ice. This did not fix the problem and the engine quickly lost power and began running so roughly it was shaking the plane. I turned towards the airport; verified I was getting about 75 MPH airspeed and [transmitted to ATC]; stating I had lost my engine. There was no response from tower. I started to set up to come in and attempt a left turn to land on runway 17. As I was doing this; I remembered the jet on the end of the runway and figured with the strong tailwind; I would not be able to get stopped in time to avoid crashing into it. Because my engine was still running so rough it was shaking the airplane; I knew it was still running and figured it was still producing at least some power. I decided to instead attempt a 180 degree turn for a landing on runway 35. I was somewhere between 1/3 to 1/2 of the way south of the north end of the runway so I turned south to set up my turn and to give me a little more runway for a landing. After I made this turn; I again [tried to contact ATC] and again there was no response from the tower. Somewhere around half-way down the runway I started my 180 degree turn. Because of how close I was to the runway; I knew the turn was going to be steep so I lowered my nose to gain a little more airspeed so I wouldn't stall and concentrated on keeping the turn coordinated. I ended up west of the runway but was able to keep turning and line up over the runway with about 75 feet of altitude to spare. I then was able to realize the shaking from the engine had popped my audio panel button out. I pushed it back in and was able to communicate with tower. Tower cleared me to land and advised they saw me making a turn by the tower and smoke was coming from my airplane. When I got on the ground; I realized my oil pressure was low. After I got stopped; there was oil noticeably leaking from the engine compartment. A preliminary check by the mechanic revealed oil in two cylinders and no compression in the left two cylinders.Problem-Deviation from ATC instructionsContributing Factors-Engine failure; com failureCorrective Actions-[Return to the field]Corrective Actions-After landing was assured; troubleshoot/correct com failurePerceptions; Judgements; Decisions-Strong tailwind and jet on runway prevented original plan to land on runway 17.Perceptions; Judgements; Decisions-Realization that rough engine meant engine was at least still running and may provide some power to allow 180 degree turn for landing on runway 35.Actions or Inactions-Emergency landing on runway 35.Factors Affecting Quality of Human Performance-Stress of situation prevented me from realizing my com failure and its cause until I was lined up over the runway and knew I was going to be able to land safely. Stress of situation also prevented me from realizing other options such as simply landing in the center of the airport on the grass or attempting a 90 degree turn to the right to land on runway 30.",,,,"The pilot of a C150 reported an engine malfunction and return to the field that included a temporary loss of communication.",

I then attempted a restart; the only way I could get the engine running was to use the primer and pump the throttle; I was able to clear the runway and then the engine lost power again. I noticed the primer began sucking air. I notified the tower I would need a tow; at which point I switched to ground; let them know and then called the FBO and was towed to the ramp. The fuel gauges showed over a quarter tank in the left and less than a quarter but above 1/8 on the right. I jumped up on the wing prior to the tow and noted that the right tank was empty and the left tank had a decent quantity of fuel remaining. I had flown 5.9 hours at that point; this was the longest flight I had done between fueling; the next longest was around 5 hours. This c-150 was equipped with extended range tanks. 38 gallons total; 3 gallons unusable. 35 gallons usable; I had flown the aircraft approximately 43 hours prior to the incident in the past two weeks. The fuel burn was averaging 5 to 5.5 gallons per hour. When I fueled the aircraft the right tank took 19.1 gallons and the left took 13.0 gallons this left me with 7.9 gallons remaining total with 1.5 unusable remaining. (The unusable fuel in the right tank was used). The math showed that assuming 3 gallons unusable I had 4.9 gallons remaining. The fuel burn on that flight came out to 5.35 GPH which left me with 0.9 hours of fuel remaining. After refueling the aircraft I called a mechanic and explained the situation to him we both agreed the aircraft had an issue with the fuel system; not the engine. I noted that I did not fly an extended period of uncoordinated flight or turns around a point for an extended time. The plan was to sump the fuel and do an extended ground runup. I filled out accident/incident paperwork with the FBO and they took a copy of my pilot certificate.

My aircraft had strobes; beacon and high-intensity wingtip pulse lights (all on).Instructor on ground in Piper with student preparing for flight mid-field replied that 'Looked good to him; as no one in pattern and they would be another 5 minutes'.Called '1.5 m RB 16 2200; planning long landing' (to allow the Piper to back-taxi if they were ready).Another aircraft; a C150; then called 'Entering Downwind.'I looked to downwind and saw nothing.Called C150 asked 'What is your position?'Reply: 'Just departed the runway and am turning downwind.'Not seeing him on the expected 16 RH XWIND asked 'What runway did you depart from?'Reply: '34'I banked sharply away from base to the north; belatedly looking for an aircraft about in my position.As the wing came up I saw a C150 turning 34 LH XWIND to Downwind less than 50 feet horizontally and less than a wingspan above my altitude.We were turning away from each other. I called 'Have C150 turning downwind 34 in sight - do you have me 16 Base?'He replied; 'No; but am looking.'I advised him that I was now at his 8 o'clock; not a factor.Landed 16 and cleared at the first exit; next to the Piper as the C150 continued in pattern for 34. The Piper decided to hold; and so advised the C150.The C150 landed 34 and attempted to make the first turnout as was evident by the smoke coming from what must have been locked mains. Sliding past the turnout; he made a 180 so the Piper could take the runway.The instructor with the student on the ground was unaware of the C150 until the 'turning downwind' call. It is possible that the C150 - based on the landing I observed - had waved off from a first approach and was never low enough for the IP to be aware of. This would also fit with his being at pattern altitude on 34 XWIND about 3/4 mile N of the field (remarkable performance for a C150).  All Speculation.The C150 was a transient aircraft flown by pilot who had not briefed properly as to the traffic flow at ZZZ (16 Being the Calm Wind Runway). As I had been listening since 10 miles out; also do not believe he had made any calls until 'entering downwind' in response to my second call.My own flying was not optimal. Given the mid-field smoke; it may have been better to have made a straight-in to 16; for then I could have seen traffic on either 16 or 34. However; do not like straight-in approaches; and did not want to fly in the thin; but pungent; smoke - thus chose; and announced the RB entry.I was lulled into a lack of vigilance by it being early on a [weekend] at my rural home field when little traffic was expected and which expectation had mistakenly been confirmed by another based aircraft.When I became aware of another aircraft near the airport I made the serious error of looking where I expected it to be based upon his ambiguous radio call; not; as I should have; to first see if there was any immediate threat in the vicinity of my aircraft.That was a near-fatal error.",,,,"A general aviation pilot reported a near mid air collision in the pattern of an uncontrolled airport.",

I was in line for takeoff at Okeechobee; FL; an un-towered field. When I first lined up there were 5 planes in line for takeoff not including myself; along with a pretty clobbered pattern. I started getting a little nervous. It eventually gets to be my turn; and I turn my plane short of the hold-short line towards the final leg to watch for traffic. One plane lands; and I immediately spot another on final; so I wait for it as well. This plane lands; and I do not see another plane on final; so I turn to watch the plane that just landed. This plane taxis all the way down the runway before turning off; contributing to my impatience to depart. By the time this plane exits the runway; I have heard a call for a final turn and see the plane on approach. This plane lands; and I hear another plane call a base turn. At this point someone else; I assume someone behind me suggests I lineup and hold on the runway to expedite departure. This makes me feel even more impatient; like I'm holding all of these people up. The landing plane departs the runway promptly; so I begin rolling out to the runway; over the hold-short line. As I'm rolling out to the runway; I hear a call for a final turn. I hadn't called for entering the runway yet due to a clobbered frequency so I make that call. At this point; I hadn't seen anyone on the final or base leg just earlier; so I'm almost rolling onto the runway; so I elect to depart; as I believe the traffic that just called final is adequately far back.At this point I'm recalling the experience I had on my initial approach to this same field; where a plane lined up and held on the runway as I was turning final; and held until I was nearly on short final before departing. I figured this kind of close-in traffic is the way a super-busy uncontrolled airspace is (I typically fly out of TIX; a controlled field). I understand now; that that should not be the case (lining up and holding prevents the PIC from seeing traffic behind them to a large degree...)As I hit my takeoff speed; I see a yellow biplane appear off my right; 100 to 200 feet up; having apparently been on short final when calling final. This is my first time at this airfield and have never performed a high-speed takeoff abort; so at this point I elect to continue flying and divert slightly left to provide space; but continue on heading so as to not-complicate the situation further. I continue out and depart the airspace; unclear where the biplane deviated off of my right side. At that point I was highly upset.I believe the combination of factors contributed to my choice to take off. First being my experience on approach to the airfield; where I got uncomfortably (for me) close to departing traffic which was holding on the runway while I was on my final leg. Second was my overall nerves; I hadn't been to this airfield before; and had not experienced this amount of traffic before either. Thirdly; the people behind me calling (seemingly) impatiently for my departure. Finally; my assumption about the position of the traffic making radio calls.As far as corrective actions; I will no longer let other people and pressure affect my decision to depart. Additionally; I will even more earnestly visually verify the position of traffic in the pattern. Finally; if I ever feel uncomfortable departing in a clobbered pattern like that; I will request that traffic in pattern extend the downwind to give me a little extra time.",,,,"C150 student pilot reported a NMAC occurred on takeoff from OBE; a non-tower airport.",

My single-engine training (and much of my personal flying since) was almost exclusively in Grumman Cheetahs; but I've started renting 150/52s from a different school in the last few weeks to save some money while building time. To get checked out with them; I did a tailwheel endorsement in their converted 152; including a good number of takeoffs and landings on grass. Before the incident described below; though; I did already have about 10 hours in the nose wheel 150 involved.One of the jobs I've talked to in the past few months told me to get in touch again once I had 400 hours. Being about ten short of that; I set out this weekend to be able to finally email them back next week by taking a roundabout trip [to multiple locations] to get lunch. I was trying to get off pretty early to make it to [my destination] before dark; since ceilings were marginal there and none of the 150/52s are equipped with GPS; and I'm still reacquainting myself with navigation solely by VOR. But while I was pre-flighting; the owner and head instructor of the school showed up; so I got to talking over my plans with him briefly. He mentioned ZZZ usually had avgas for a steal; and that the 24 gallons I was starting out with should be enough to get me to ZZZ1 then halfway back to ZZZ; where I could pick up enough fuel to make it all the way down to [my destination]. (This particular plane has long-range tanks; just barely shy of 40 gallons.)The flight up was uneventful. In ZZZ1; I dipped the tanks and showed six gallons per side still. I assumed if I had made it the whole way there from [my departure airport] on just half of what I started out with; I could easily make it halfway back before refueling.The first thing that gave me pause was that both gas gauges were pegged at empty when I started up. (It certainly made me miss the Shadin fuel computers I'm used to in my regular Cheetahs.) But I had literally just seen the gas in the tanks with my own eyes; so I trusted my arithmetic and set off. Still; those two gigantic E's staring at me from the gas gauges convinced me to fly at economy cruise at least half the way to ZZZ. At that setting; though; I was seeing a groundspeed in the mid-40-knot range; and my estimated time en route ballooned from one hour and 20 minutes to close to three hours--which should have been my first gigantic red flag. About halfway there; the needle on the right gas gauge started to bounce off of empty; which inspired me to go back to full power; pushing my groundspeed into the 70s. I was feeling more confident in my mental fuel calculations; despite the wind. Before long (relatively speaking); I was approaching ZZZ2; about ten miles north of ZZZ. To see the airport practically within gliding distance melted my last bit of unease about fuel right about the time Center sent me to the advisory frequency. I called ZZZ traffic on a four-mile final; but within 60 seconds the engine started to sputter. I pumped the mixture and throttle to see if it was just a hiccup; then once I was convinced low fuel was the actual problem; I wagged the nose up and down to see if I could re-port the last few drops. But at about 1500 feet and two miles from the runway; the engine stopped for good. I felt overwhelmed for about a second; but then accepted that it was actually happening and that I was going to have to decide what to do. I quickly went back to Center so someone would know to come looking for me in case I was knocked unconscious; but I was already too low for them to receive me. For a few seconds; it looked like I might actually be able to make the runway; but the 20 knot headwind quickly made it apparent that wasn't possible. In fact; it became pretty clear that the field directly in front of me; was where I was going to land. It looked like very neatly planted curving rows of short grass; with apparent furrows between the rows; and ridges about five feet from top to bottom spaced maybe 100 feet apart. I was amazed at how steeply I had to nose over to maintain best glide speed; I guess because of either the strong headwind or the wind milling propeller; which sure seems to create a lot more drag than the engine pulled to idle as I was used to it from training. Still; I managed to flare and touch down pretty gently; all things considered; and came to a stop very shortly.Not long after shutting down; calling the airport for help; and thanking God that everything had gone as well as it had; the farmer whose field I had just made a runway pulled up to the gate along [the highway] and drove out to greet me. He had heard me lose power and seen me coming down; although my actual landing was obscured from his vantage point at his house in the southwest corner of the field. He said he was afraid he was going to find a flipped plane when he got out to the see what had happened; but was quite calm and friendly when he saw me walking around and that nothing seemed damaged. He informed me that there were cows in the field that might come by to see the plane; and that I should call him if I needed help with anything. My hope was that I'd be able to get some gas and take off again from the field; and I thought I might need him to corral the cows; which I had yet to see anywhere around the part of the field I had landed in. I gave him my number and told him to let me know if there was any damage to the field; but he didn't seem at all concerned about that; although he did say he'd appreciate a call before I took off so he could come watch.He left; while I waited for the airport manager; who had sounded very concerned and ready to come help as quickly as possible when I had talked to her on the phone; although she wasn't sure what to do about gas. She called one more time to confirm exactly where I was; but just before she arrived; the farmer came back with his wife and granddaughter to see how things were going. When the airport manager did arrive; she had a man with her as well; who turned out to be a doctor and himself a pilot with lots of experience landing and taking off from fields; a rather happy combination for someone who finds himself in the situation I was in. They had brought two five-gallon cans of avgas; but before we even bothered with that; he looked the plane over and started scanning the field for the feasibility of getting back in the air. I had been thinking about the length of the field--the farmer had told me it was about half-a-mile--as well as the the upward slope from north to south; the direction into the wind; but he pointed out that the terracing presented a real danger of a prop-strike as I picked up speed; which would not have occurred to me. (He noted that there were no signs on the propeller of any contact from the landing; which I assume I would have noticed had it happened; but it was reassuring to hear it from a clearly more experienced pilot who knew what to look for.) We walked and drove all around the upper portion of the field; and scouted a route that seemed feasible. It started on one crest; moved diagonally down and up the next; then curved to the right to stay on top of that ridge as it bent due south directly toward a line of trees (and more into the wind); a small billboard; and [a highway].After talking over short-field technique and the particular importance of getting and keeping the nose wheel up as I accelerated down one crest and up the next; we (mostly) emptied one gas can into each wing; swung the plane around by hand to get it facing the starting point we had decided upon; and I got the engine going and taxied back while the airport manager and the pilot drove their car to a point along my path at which I would abort my takeoff if I didn't seem to be getting airborne. After a run up; I held my brakes; revved the engine all the way up; and embarked on my curved take-off path. I got down the first ridge and up the second without any problems or prop strikes; by which point the plane was starting to feel light on its wheels. As I passed the car; only my right wheel was on the ground as I lowered my right wing into the wind and finished my turn southward. Shortly thereafter; I was completely off the ground; and I lowered my nose to point directly at the billboard as I gathered speed. The poor 150 does not feel athletic; but it does feel light; and I was confident by this point that I was going to be able to climb over any of the obstacles in my path; however meagerly. And indeed; I gave the interstate quite a show; being surely no higher than 200 feet over the passing cars. Within a minute; I was touching down on runway XY at ZZZ; and another minute later was refueling at the much more conventional self-serve pumps.The whole experience left me with several strong impressions. First of all; all the clich?? you hear training for your private certificate and in case studies are true. When the engine first seized; so did I; refusing to believe what was actually happening. Once I overcame that; I had to convince myself as the headwind pushed the airport out of reach that I was not going to stretch my range enough to make a still embarrassing but ultimately much less consequential landing on the runway. I actually took the time to think to myself in that moment how inconvenient this off-airport landing was going to be. Realizing the ridiculousness of that concern in the face of a still very potential crash landing; I did what I had been taught to do; even though it felt very different than any of the simulations I had done with an instructor sitting next to me. As I've already mentioned; the downward attitude necessary to maintain glide speed was far more dramatic than I would have expected; but I'm exceedingly glad I committed to it.When I had a little more time to decompress back at the airport and on my return flight; the precarious balance of bad luck versus good luck really struck me. On the bad side; if the winds had been a little bit weaker; if I had stayed at my economy cruise setting a little longer; heck; if I had left with two more tablespoons of fuel in the tanks; I might have had a moment of fear when I fit a whole 40 gallons in my tanks while refueling at the airport; but the experience would have been much easier to forget in the long run. But of course; when I say bad luck; I really mean bad planning and dangerous assumptions on my part as PIC. (As my wife quoted me from months before when I told her all this after getting home from this long day's journey: 'There's no excuse for running out of fuel.') The good luck really is amazing; though: at 1500 feet AGL with a 20 knot headwind; my only real decision was to execute a forced landing on the beautiful field right below me; or crash trying to make it to the runway; if I had been at an airport surrounded by trees; there would have been no outcome as neat and tidy as what I experienced today. Of course; the mere fact that almost all of my flying is within the [local area] means I often have a nice field below me to land on. Or if I had been less cautious and tried to fly the whole way at high-speed cruise; I might have ended up in a field far less convenient than one mile from my intended fuel stop; right by two big highways; between two towns; and within cellphone reception. And how could I have possibly planned a forced landing a mere phone call away from an experienced pilot with an extensive history flying in and out of soft-fields; an airport manager all too happy to help out an embarrassed pilot; and a farmer undeservedly unconcerned about a little thing like an airplane scratching up his field.",,,,"A pilot of a Cessna 150 reported that he ran out of gas prior to reaching the airport.",

They were not within 300 feet of pattern altitude and not even past the departure end of the runway; they passed very close in front of the Runway 21R upwind Cessna for no reason whatsoever other than the Local 2 controller trying to prove a point.

Additionally; Aircraft Y is considerably faster than Aircraft X. Aircraft Y was going to takeoff and fly right into Aircraft X because Aircraft X was instructed to turn straight in front of Aircraft Y. The only thing that stopped a NMAC or mid-air collision from occurring was Aircraft Y saw the problem unfolding and told the local controller that he would wait a few seconds before starting takeoff roll because of the other aircraft about to cross his upwind path.

The air was calm and temperature was a little warm but not yet hot. The preflight and run up were normal. I took off; flew the pattern and had a good landing. I powered up for my next lap. The airspeed was alive and close to rotate speed when I noticed a nose wheel shimmy. I increased back pressure to take some weight off of the nose wheel. The plane rotated and took off; but the shimmy continued. I thought; this is a motor problem. I was still accelerating and climbing so rather than try to force the plane back on the runway and try to stop I continued to climb straight out. I wasn't climbing very well and at about 200 feet the climb stopped. There was no safe place to land straight out so I began a very shallow left turn; maybe 10 degrees bank. I radioed [local] traffic; told them I was having engine trouble and to clear all runways I was attempting to return. They acknowledged and said the runway is clear. My thought was; I'm above all obstacles; if I can maintain 200 feet and can make it. Of course; the plane started losing altitude during the turn. By the time I was lined up on the highway; which parallels the runway; I was at about 100 feet. I stopped the turn in the hopes of gaining some altitude. I wasn't gaining and the stall horn was chirping. I looked about 20 degrees to my left and there was the runway. But there was no safe place to land between me and the runway and it would have meant another 20 degree turn. As badly as I wanted to land on the airport; I knew this would be my fatal 'I can make it' error many pilots make.I radioed local traffic again and told them I would be landing on the highway. I now focused on the highway. This stretch of [road] is two lanes in both directions with a large grass center with a dividing barrier. I have often thought to myself; if I am ever forced to land on the highway to not line up on the white line. My right wing might hit a highway sign. Instead; I set up on the fast lane. My right wing would be in the slow lane and my left wing over the median where there are no signs. There were no cars in front of me but I couldn't see what was directly below me or behind me. I didn't want someone driving up underneath me so I nosed down for a little burst of speed.I leveled at about 20 feet hoping someone behind me wasn't texting while driving. I glanced over at the oncoming traffic and saw bulging eyes and open mouths. I made a flaps up landing on the narrowest runway I've ever landed on; the width of a single car lane. I came to a stop in the slow lane and shut down. Avionics off; master off; key off and removed.I climbed out of the aircraft and turned around to look at traffic. Right behind me was a fire truck. They were returning from putting out a small brush fire and saw the whole thing. I gave them a thumbs up and went to the back of the plane. Pushing down on the rear of the plane; I rotated it 90 degrees so the tail was off the highway with the wings parallel to the highway. I rolled it back to clear the traffic lanes then sat down on the tire to call my wife; also a pilot. Poor thing was at the airport and had watched the whole thing. I wanted to let her know I was down and safe.Looking back; had I not been wearing active noise reduction headsets I probably would have heard it was an engine problem and aborted the takeoff. Once off the ground I didn't panic. Fly the plane. I knew the location of all my nearby emergency landing areas at that end of the runway. As I was turning first up was some long straight shallow sewage ponds (not my first choice). Next is a grass field then the highway. I didn't get sucked into the 'I can make it' mindset. I trusted in the skills I had been taught; what the aircraft was giving me.",,,,"C150 pilot reported a loss of engine power that resulted in an off-field landing.",

Prior to my departure the owner of [the banner business] told me that no one had ever towed a banner this big with this aircraft. Based upon my experience with [this aircraft]; I expected it to do very well. I hooked the sign on the first pass and experienced a slower rate of climb. I was instantly told to return for a drop because it wasn't flying correctly. By the time I turned base I still hadn't reached pattern altitude but I believed it likely had to do with whatever was wrong with the sign. I dropped the sign in the grass without incident and returned to assist setting it up for another pick. While we were doing this; [the owner] asked me if I thought I was going to be able to pull it okay. I said; 'Yes; I think so; as long as it's okay for me to climb straight to reach 1000 ft prior to any turns'. He agreed with this strategy.I departed a second time for closed traffic; missed the first attempt and successfully picked up the sign on my second. The tower verified that the sign was towing straight but again I experienced a very anemic rate of climb. Despite some radio problems; I was given permission to pick up the banner and continue banner ops just using the hand held. However; since the throttle friction lock; allows the throttle to back off a tiny bit I never felt like I could abandon it under this poor performance to pick up the radio. I continued south as I said I would. I reached 300 ft and could not climb higher and struggled with this all the way. My airspeed was between 45 and 50. At some point I began experiencing a 200 FPM rate of descent. If something didn't change fast I was going to drop it. I cleaned the wings to zero flaps (was on 5 degrees) and zig zagged a little towards headings more favorable for wind lift or towards hotter areas for thermal assist. I continued south all the way to a point in where again I was unable to sustain altitude and the banner apparently clipped the top of a tree. I felt a light tug and turned to see some leaves falling. Later inspection by a fellow tow pilot revealed no damage to the sign. I successfully turned back north and eventually was able to climb to 600 ft and return to drop to the north. Apparently 80 x 40 ft is just too big for this airplane.My boss expressed his disapproval of my decision-making and insisted that I should have ditched the sign off airport instead of struggling to continue. There were perhaps eight to ten sites where I could have done so. Each time; the reason I continued was that it seemed to me that what I was doing was working and I was able to climb again. However; my gains were unsustainable and I was never able to get past 400 ft while heading south.The reason I continued south so far was that I did not want to diminish my vertical component of lift with the demands of a turn. When I later told this to [the owner]; he reminded me that turning is how banner tows slack the line and climb. In retrospect; I do remember hearing this during my training but it's not something we ever practiced with a drill of any kind and I never had it reinforced with any kind of reading. Perhaps it would have worked to some degree but the reality is this: that banner was too big for that airplane and the drag was too great. Based upon my limited experience with towing; I believed it would be up to the job. It definitely wasn't. Originally; I was trying to climb at 50 MPH with 5 degrees of flaps as I was trained. When that failed; I cleaned the wings to zero flaps and tried multiple air speeds to find that about 47 MPH produced the most climb.After the incident with the tree; I was over an obstacle free flat pasture area. This was another location where I could have safely ditched but again I was able to get it to climb. I slowly continued a slight left turn through the valley and started tracking back to the north. I tightened the throttle friction lock; pitched down a little and communicated to ZZZ Tower that there was a problem with the sign and I needed to return for a drop. They told me I was cleared to drop to the north and I did so without incident.I suspect [the owner's] inquiry about my ability to tow this banner with this plane reveals what he already knew: this was questionable and I was performing as a test pilot. In retrospect; I think we should have attempted it early one cool morning instead of finding out in the thinner air of an 80 degree day with 1360 ft density altitude. If permitted to continue to serve in this way I will not tow an 80x40 banner with this aircraft and if I ever face with the same scenario I will ditch the sign at the first suitable site.",,,,"C150 banner tow pilot reported operating with a banner that was much too large for the aircraft.",

Both of us were loud and clear on 123.0. About 30 minutes prior to this I had observed an aircraft taking off to the north (Rwy 35); but since winds were light from the southeast; both of us on the ground taxied to Rwy 17 for departure. The other aircraft departed first and turned left to downwind for a touch-and-go. I departed next; also turning left to downwind.  We both continuously called pattern position in the traffic pattern. The aircraft ahead of me performed a touch-and-go; and since I planned a full-stop; I offered to turn off at mid-field. The other pilot said to go ahead and back-taxi and he would just extend. The other pilot was on crosswind as I turned base.  I was a bit high and fast so I concentrated on losing altitude and speed with a sideslip. I touched down just a bit long but on speed. At that moment I noticed an aircraft at the other end of the runway. He was not displaying a landing light (I was). I realized he had just touched down and that we were on a collision course. I considered leaving the runway surface to the right; but there were taxiway lights at midfield and I was concerned about colliding with one.  So I got as far right on the runway as I could and depended on the other pilot to do the same. There was insufficient room for me to come to a complete stop short of the midfield taxiway. We passed near midfield with wing clearance fortunately; and I was doing 30-40 mph. I was also calling out on the radio to the other pilot in the pattern that we had an aircraft landing opposite direction so he would not turn final. Afterward I taxied back; and finally the Cardinal came up on frequency 123.0 and called out that he was back-taxiing on 35. I advised him that 17 was the active. The only other communication from the Cardinal was when he exited the runway at the south end. My daughter was also monitoring 123.0 and verified that the Cardinal never made any transmissions on frequency prior to landing.

We were at maximum gross weight with 16 gallons of fuel in our tanks. 3.5 gallons of fuel is unusable; meaning we had 12.5 usable gallons onboard. The 1-hour flight to ZZZ would take 1 hour; meaning we would have burned 6 gallons. Usable fuel remaining would be 6.5 gallons. A flight back to our home airport would take roughly 30 minutes; meaning we would only have 3.5 usable gallons remaining after we landed back home if we did not refuel. Therefore we knew we would need to re-fuel before heading home.My personal minimum is to have 1 hour of fuel remaining after each flight. The TAFs in our area were forecasting MVFR and IFR weather to arrive within 6 hours. This region is known for having bad weather arrive earlier than forecast. Therefore I wanted more than 1 hour of fuel to be in the tanks after we landed at our home airport so that we wouldn't be left without ample options to find a different place to land if the weather rolled in early.[By the time] we landed at ZZZ; both FBOs had closed. No self-serve fuel was available. Neither of us realized this until after we landed at ZZZ. Further complicating the matter is the fact that no airports on the way home had self-serve fuel. Rather than pay a fee for a line service after-hours call; we elected to go to a nearby airport to refuel. We chose ZZZ1; which had low-intensity runway lighting and self-serve fuel available; or so we thought. So we departed towards ZZZ1. The total enroute time was 20 minutes. We estimated we would have 4 usable gallons remaining. This was legal per actual fuel consumption numbers; but per a conservative burn rate estimate; it would have been below my personal minimums. I had not realized this until later when I would write this report.When we arrived over ZZZ1; we realized that the low-intensity runway lights were inoperative. This was an unexpected problem. Further complicating the matter is that this airport is located in essentially the middle of nowhere. I could see the beacon briefly illuminate portions of the pavement as it rotated around; but I could not take the chance at landing on a dark runway in unfamiliar territory. With 4 usable gallons remaining; we were now technically in emergency fuel status; but did not realize it at the time. We did know; however; that our fuel situation was getting uncomfortably tight.We had to make the decision to go back to ZZZ or choose another airport. We believed ZZZ would be slightly upwind and another airport to be slightly downwind based on our wind aloft estimations. The slightly downwind airport was ZZZ2; and it had self-serve fuel. The total time to ZZZ2 would be about 25 minutes. A conservative fuel burn estimate of 6 gallons/hour would mean we would use 3 gallons. In writing this report; I realize that would leave us with 1 usable gallon remaining. While actually flying the leg; I failed to account for the 'unusable' fuel and figured we would land with 5 gallons; failing to remember that 3.5 gallons of that would be unusable. I believe I was in denial about the whole situation.I notified the overlying approach control of the lighting situation at ZZZ1 and requested flight following to ZZZ2. The Approach Controller acknowledged my report and provided us with radar flight following to ZZZ2.Thankfully; all of our fuel calculation with a 20% more conservative burn rate than what is published in the POH. Despite knowing we had inflated the burn rate to be conservative; I was extremely nervous going into ZZZ2 because of the thought of exhausting all of our usable fuel. We made it to ZZZ2 without incident. When I exited the airplane; I used a dipstick to measure the fuel tank quantity. We had 2.5 gallons per tank for a total of 5 gallons remaining. 3.5 of those total gallons are unusable; meaning we had 1.5 gallons of usable fuel remaining. This was both illegal and below my personal minimums. I was horrified at what had happened.The chain of events went as follows: We depart at maximum gross weight with 16 gallons of fuel. We plan to arrive at an airport before the FBOs close; but land later than planned. Not wanting to pay an FBO call out fee; we depart for a nearby airport that has both runway lighting and self-serve fuel advertised in the Chart Supplement U.S. We arrive at the nearby airport with minimum fuel only to find the runway lighting inoperative. We make a decision to go to another airport that is downwind of the wind aloft and end up landing with 1 gallon of usable fuel; or 10 minutes of usable fuel remaining.This whole incident has resulted in a big change in approach to how I will conduct night cross country training in the future. First; our SOPs will be amended as follows:1. Flights to any airport must have an ETA of no later than 1 hour prior to the closing time of airport fuel vendors if the destination does not have self-serve fuel available.2. Night flights must have enough usable fuel onboard to reach two alternate airports; both of which must have fuel available and airfield lighting.3. In the event a flight lands at the planned destination and no fuel vendors or self-serve fuel are available; students are required to pay the call out fee to refuel. At night; the alternate airports may be flown to only if a call out is not possible.Next; I will be more involved in the cross country planning of my students. I should have recognized the fact that ZZZ had no fueling available well prior to arriving there after the FBOs had closed. And I should have required my student to pay a call out fee rather than agreeing to fly somewhere else considering that we didn't have legal fuel remaining to make it to an alternate should our refueling airport be closed; or in this case; should our refueling airport have an unexpected lighting outage.I reported the outage to the overlying approach control listed in this report. I then called FSS in the morning to report the outage. The Approach Controller seemed uninterested in the problem; and the FSS specialist referred me to the airport administration. When I called the airport administration; the manager was unavailable; and I was told to leave a message. To this day; 48 hours later; the problem has not been fixed; and no NOTAM has been issued.",,,,"Cessna 150 flight instructor reported departing with minimal fuel after founding that fuel was unavailable at the destination airport when the FBO closed.",

I did this several times. I checked NOAA weather for ZZZ and the local weather was clear and sunny. I had checked AIRNAV for ZZZ field to get frequencies and runway information the night before. I proceeded with my flight. Prior to descending I tuned into AWOS-2 and there was no information being transmitted. I tried continuously as I got closer with the same results. My pilot friend who was meeting me there was a couple of minutes ahead of me. I had never been to this airport before. High terrain is near the airport. My friend landed as I was on right downwind and flying over a high ridge obscuring the runway on my right. I announced right base and while turning final. I could see runway was closed with a large yellow X but the taxiway clear and available with no obstructions so I landed as my friend did a couple of minutes before. It was very quiet and not busy. The landing on the hard surface was uneventful and normal. I taxied to the parking area and noticed orange wheel blocks at the taxiway entrance at the parking area. After I got out of my airplane I saw someone driving towards the hangar area and stopped to ask him if the airport was closed and he told me it was. I now realized I landed in error. I also saw another pilot preparing his plane to depart the airport. It was apparent he is a tenant at the airport.The issue I have is AWOS and the phone number for AWOS was not operational but should have been announcing the airport is closed. I inadvertently missed a NOTAM that my pilot friend checked on the FAA link for NOTAMs for this airport and was unable to find it prior to landing. I along with most pilots rely on AWOS information for information for situation like this. It is just another avenue to information in case you miss something. We were met by several pilot/tenants who expressed their frustration with the airport closure. Most if not all the pilots based at the field were not notified of the closure until the day before it was closed. We were told a sign was placed at the airport the day of the closure so arriving pilots would know. We were told the manager is a non-pilot which makes it awkward to complain about issues at the airport. The concerned pilot/tenants have several other safety issues that have not been addressed.I recommend that AWOS frequency and the phone number be operational and broadcast the airport closure. This is one of several sources pilots rely on.

I could not find my way back to my home airport. I went west to our practice area for some slow flight and turns around a point and some S turns. I drifted south much more than I believed and when I turned east to go back to my home airport; I realized I was lost. I spent an hour or so trying to find a landmark I recognized to no avail. After approximately 2 hours in the air I was concerned about my fuel supply. I had only about 15 gallons on board when I left. I was increasingly concerned about running out of fuel and crashing. I had previously believed I would find my way back home and made a bad decision to pass up a couple of small airports where I could have landed and refueled. By the time I saw ZZZ Airport I was convinced I was in an emergency situation and had to land and refuel.Unfortunately; I had not brought my sectional chart with me that day and could not use it to help me find some recognizable landmarks. I also had nothing with me to give me the radio frequencies of any airports or towers. I felt I could not contact the Tower at ZZZ so as I was fearful of fuel starvation; I decided it was better to land and not crash. I carefully observed no traffic in the vicinity of ZZZ and no planes moving on the ground even.I decided I must land. Unfortunately; I did not think of trying to get the Tower's attention and get a green light permission to land. I was not even sure that towers gave permission to land by lights in these modern times. I know now that they still do that. I called the tower by phone that I borrowed and apologized and gave them my name; tail number and phone number. I got the tower frequencies from the FBO and established radio contact with the Tower and Ground Control. I got permission to taxi and clearance to takeoff and went on my way to my home base.I learned many valuable lessons that day.First; I learned to always take everything I might need; even on a short flight near my own airport. Charts; navigation aids on my phone which I had left in my car; full gas tanks; letting someone know where I was going and how soon I should be back; which I did not do that day. I know now that even if I lose my radios; I know to Squawk 7600 and wait for a light signal from the Tower before I attempt to land.I made many questionable or downright bad decisions that day due to poor decision making and not ever having been lost before. But; I do learn from my mistakes and this situation if it ever happens that I am lost or low on fuel will never find me so ill prepared.I did two hours of ground instruction with my CFI friend today on what to do if [I get] lost and how to prevent getting lost in the first place; and how to contact someone by radio or phone to help me in such situations. I deeply regret my entering Class Delta airspace as I have never had any problems and do realize that I might have put others; in the air or on the ground; in jeopardy. Thankfully no one was hurt and no property was damaged.I now know that I must be prepared every time I go up in the air for any unforeseen circumstance.

In so doing; I verified that the aircraft had full fuel; which is about four hours of flying time; and found that its VHF radio was operative. The takeoff went as expected; with no issues. I [departed] VFR. After about 3 hours and fifteen minutes of flying; while on approach to ZZZ; my engine began to sputter. I immediately suspected induction icing due to temperature and visible moisture; but after an inflight check of my systems; I was unable to get the engine to run smoothly. Eventually the engine; completely died; and I was unable to restart it. After the engine died; I stabilized the airplane at the best rate of glide. I was not near any airports and was not flying very high. I spotted a hard surface roadway and landed the Cessna 150 without any incident or damage to the airplane. It was decided that the aircraft should be towed to the nearest airport for mechanical assessment. I was not cited or arrested for landing on the highway. I believe that the cause of the engine failure was carburetor icing and low fuel. I had just purchased this Cessna 150; and this was my first time flying [it] cross country. I verified that it had full fuel on board before departing and it should have been able to fly four hours on the full fuel; according to the POH.  Later that day; the airplane was refueled; and I elected to depart and fly on to ZZZ. While I was enroute to ZZZ; I noticed that the ATC approach controllers were not responding to any of my radio ATC transmissions; but I could hear them speaking to me. I attempted to get the Cessna's panel installed radio to work; but it would not. I had a handheld backup radio on board; but it also did not enable me to talk to ATC. Since I had previously experienced the issue with having the less than four hours of fuel available on full tanks; and I had been flying for over three hours by that time; I elected to land at ZZZ1.

Forecast overcast conditions were moving into the area; and our home base of ZZZ1 was reporting OVC010. I filed an IFR flight plan while at ZZZ; departed VFR; and requested an IFR clearance from D10 TRACON. The controller asked me if I could maintain my own terrain and obstruction clearance from my present altitude through 2;500 ft MSL. I accepted; noting that a large antenna complex with tops at 2;500 ft MSL was approximately 2 miles north. The controller advised me that upon reaching 2;500 to fly heading 250.When I reached 2;500; I flew heading 250. The controller then asked me if I could maintain my own terrain and obstruction clearance for 3 more miles. Because I was local to the area and was familiar with the relevant obstructions; I accepted; however; this is still a misuse of Section 4-2-8 in the 7110.65. The 250 heading I was assigned was actually not sufficient to prevent the wind from drifting me into the antenna complex. As a result; when I accepted (for a second time) terrain and obstruction clearance; I made a left turn to about a 210 heading; which put me on a track that diverged from the antennas.Had this procedure been applied to a non-local pilot; the controller would have essentially allowed a pilot to climb from VFR into IMC conditions near an antenna complex; with the false expectation that upon reaching the 2;500 ft altitude specified that he would no longer have responsibility for terrain and obstruction clearance. The problem is that by the time 2;500 ft was reached; we were much closer to the antenna complex than when we started the climb. Factoring in any delays in notifying a pilot that he needs to take back terrain and obstruction clearance responsibility when he is that close to the antennas; or any other factors; and this could cause a CFIT accident.The simple solution is to follow the procedures already in the 7110.65. When asking pilots who are requesting an IFR clearance to maintain terrain and obstruction clearance from our present altitude through X altitude; 'X' should be the minimum IFR altitude so that when we reach it; we know terrain and obstruction clearance responsibility goes back to and is retained by the controller. The idea that we can reach the altitude requested (in my case 2;500) and then be asked to again take back this responsibility; after flying an assigned heading no less; is not congruent with the procedures in the 7110.65 and is not addressed anywhere in the AIM.If what I propose means I get vectored across the localizer for the ILS 34 at GKY while climbing to the MVA/MIA; then so be it. I'd rather be vectored across a localizer for a few miles than not be at a sufficient altitude and have a CFIT.",,,,"A C150 pilot reported a TRACON Controller improperly applied JO7110.65; 4-2-8(d); procedure.

While executing a touch and go; close to the end of the runway at about 150-250 ft the aircraft had a partial loss of power that occurred so suddenly it left me without many options. I had no doubt I would have to land the plane somewhere very soon without enough power to keep it aloft very much longer; so with not much room to work with; and no chance to safely returning to the airport; or land on the remaining part of runway that was left; and not wanting to go off the steep end of the runway with a significant drop; I made a 90 degree turn and landed the plane in an open field next to the airport safely and with only minor damage to the airplane and no personal injuries or damage to anyone's property.Taking immediate action in a very difficult situation without many options prevented this incident from not turning out very well. However; years of good flight training resulted in a positive outcome as I did not attempt to return to the field due to low altitude and no runway left to land on; and due to good emergency and stall awareness training.Cause of engine problem is still being evaluated; what can be learned to date is that an engine power loss at low altitude demands that you are ready and prepared for such and emergency otherwise the results could be catastrophic.

I was cleared to the initial approach fix at to climb to 3;000 FT (this was to be a demonstration for my student). After climbing through 850 FT MSL I was directed to contact departure. Departure cleared me to 3;000 FT and direct to [the] IAF for the ILS approach. All initially went well. I then noted that my heading indicator was rotating freely. I asked my student to see if he could get it to stop and set it for the same heading shown in TRK on the GPS. We could not get it to stop. We then noted that the turn coordinator was not functioning correctly (it returned some time later). In the absence of a heading indicator; I changed the 430 to NAV screen 1 to match the direct heading with the indicated tracking heading. However; we learned that it was also moving about and did not match the compass.ATC asked me to report my altitude and noted that they did not have a primary radar reading on my airplane. Shortly after; I declared that I was in a 'no gyro' situation and needed assistance. They vectored me on a heading of 270 and ask that I climb to 4;000 FT to see if they could get a radar reading on me. I entered a climb but had great difficulty stabilizing my heading. At times the artificial horizon and turn coordinators worked sporadically. At 4000' I broke out of the clouds and was able to stabilize heading and climb with pilotage. ATC asked me to climb to 8;000 FT on 270 degree. I replied that I was unable in that airplane but would continue to climb. At 5;000 FT ATC directed me to turn to a heading of 180 degrees. I was able to do so with the systems operating; mostly compass. After a couple of minutes I noted the localizer for the ILS approach coming in and reported that to ATC. They asked if I was established. I replied I would be in I turned inbound immediately. The cleared me to do so and I tracked the localizer inbound. ATC then cleared me to descend to 3;000 FT. Shortly thereafter; they told me to not respond to future instructions and began reporting distance from airport and the desired altitude. I slowed the airplane and descended to intersect the glideslope. I broke out of IMC at 700 FT AGL prior to the threshold and was cleared to land and directed to contact ground on rollout.I believe I flew this mission to the best of my ability given the number of systems that were not working in the aircraft. During preflight and during the flight; the gauges indicated I had normal vacuum and electrical charge. ATC personnel met me at the airplane and we had a long discussion of what happened and I thanked them profusely for their professionalism and help.

My student preformed a pre-flight and I checked the fuel and oil quantity. Using the dipstick provided with the plane we both determined the plane had a total of 15 gallons; and at 6 GPH this would provide 2.5 hours of flight; more than enough to make the 50 NM flight and return. When we got to ZZZ1 the wind conditions were conducive to practicing cross wind landings and we performed a full stop landing and two touch and goes.We headed back to ZZZ and on the way discussed engine failure and what to do if that were to happen. We used flight following to transit [other] airspace. Once the airport was in sight and we had the weather flight following was canceled and we were switched to advisory frequency. On a straight in approach at 700 feet the engine quit. I took controls and determined that the plane would not make it to the runway. We landed on the highway a quarter mile from the airport. There were no injuries and no damage to property. Because the plane was low on fuel and the intake was located towards the back of the wing; when we pitched down for our descent; fuel could not reach the intake. In my training at a different flight school; fuel dipsticks were calibrated to show usable fuel. The dipstick provided with the plane I was flying showed total fuel and we were supposed to factor in the unusable portion. I was unaware of this.On final; the engine became rough. I asked my student 'What are you doing?' and he said 'I'm not doing that'. I took controls of the plane and found that the throttle was not responsive and at about 700 feet AGL the engine stopped.I pitched for glide. Determined we wouldn't be able to make the runway and chose the road as our best place to land. I made sure carb heat was on; turned off the fuel shutoff; mixture full lean; key out; master off; and landed it.As PIC (pilot in command) I take full responsibility for the flight. My honest opinion is that it was the result of unintentional fuel starvation. I misunderstood what the reading on the fuel dipstick was telling me. I also could've scanned the fuel gauges more thoroughly.I was concerned about staying underweight in the Cessna 150; otherwise I would have used full fuel. Because I thought that the plane had 3.5 gallons more fuel than it actually did; I thought I had 40 more minutes of reserve. This was in fact the unusable portion of fuel for a Cessna 150. I should have refueled the plane at ZZZ1.I wanted my student to save money by continuing training in the C150 as opposed to the 172. Because we had a smaller plane; the fuel we could carry was limited. I have read several publications on the fuel system of the Cessna 150 since the incident. I want to learn as much as possible; so that this never happens again. The flight school that I work for now explicitly details the fueling requirements to include the unusable portion. I will now consider whether a fuel stick is calibrated to show unusable and usable or just the usable portion of fuel.",,,,"C150 flight instructor reported an off field landing due to fuel starvation on short final.",

Abeam and east of ZZZ; I had a sudden interruption of power; a surge; and a further interruption. At the time; I was receiving Flight Following from Approach. Since emergency landing sites are very poor in the area; I decided to head to ZZZ. I was able to retain intermittent power by pumping the throttle. I first enriched mixture; but did not apply carburetor heat until later in in the glide when the engine was probably too cool to take effect. Approach turned me over to ZZZ Tower who cleared me to land on Runway XXR. I was able to make a right base approach and high final until I had the field made and performed a normal full flap landing. The engine was still running and I was able to clear the runway without interfering with other traffic.Carburetor icing was undoubtedly the problem; but I misdiagnosed it due to the sudden reduction of power. Prior experiences with carburetor icing were a gradual reduction in power. Instead of applying carburetor heat immediately; I richened mixture thinking I had a fuel contamination or sticking valve problem. I had plenty of fuel on board and subsequent examination of the sumps were clear. A full power run-up confirmed my opinion.In this case; I violated my personal rule to apply carburetor heat on first sensing an engine problem; having been misled by the sudden severe power reduction.

We had planned to practice Simulated Emergencies and basic maneuvers. Like always; since we have reduced fuel we estimated how much fuel we would need. We calculated roughly 7 gallons were all we were going to need for our 1.5 hr flight today. The weather was clear. Winds were 200 at 10 knots. Fairly calm.Upon arrival to the airplane; we began the preflight. Everything checked out to be ok; except for the right tank. The right tank had some water contaminate in the fuel. We had to sump the tank 3 times to get the water out and to be able to verify that the fuel was clean. Once we verified that the fuel was clean; we manually dipped the tanks to find that we had a total of 17 gallons. 9 gallons in the left tank and 8 gallons in the right tank. Seeing that we had 7 gallons we knew that that should give us roughly 2.5 hrs of flight allowing us to meet VFR fuel requirements of a reserve and then some. From there we started the plane up; with no issues. The run up was text book perfect. We had no issues with flying the plane.We departed from ZZZ and made a slow climb; avoiding Bravo airspace; up to 6;000 feet MSL. We started our maneuvers like Steep Turns and Slow flight. We were in slow flight with reduced power for roughly 30 minutes. We then practiced a Simulated Emergency Engine Failure; which allowed us to get to an altitude appropriate for Ground Reference maneuvers. From there flew over to ZZZ1 for 1 touch'n'go and 1 go-around. We then departed the area to the north back to ZZZ.Once we were above the VFR Waypoint at 4;000 feet; we called to Tower and received clearance to enter Right Traffic 17R and to Report Mid-Field Downwind. Shortly after reporting back the call we felt the engine start to sputter. In attempt to give the airplane as much possible power; we gave the airplane a full rich mixture; fuel pump on; and full throttle. We noticed no change in power; so we started to prepare ourselves for a forced landing. I considered turning and trying to glide towards ZZZ since we were so close; but being only 1;500 feet off of the ground the math didn't add up. We wouldn't have made it to ZZZ. Fortunately; my student has a couple of thousands of hours in helicopters; so he took the radios; and I flew the plane. We executed good Crew Resource Management. He helped me by pointing out obstacles to avoid on our way down. I had made my 180 degrees turn to face into the southerly wind and when landing on the [highway] was assured I nosed down to allow myself to have some extra speed to bleed off during the landing flare. I tried to stay 15-20 feet off the ground while bleeding the speed to allow car traffic to see me. As we slowed down; I slowly bumped in flaps helping keep us aloft. Traffic cleared and we had plenty of space to touch down. We did not hit anything. The touch-down was very soft. There were no injuries to [the student] nor I.

I had decided to bring her along to do some pattern work with me; and was making clear radio calls on my position in the traffic pattern. Upon turning crosswind; I heard a radio call from a Piper Cherokee in a thick foreign accent reporting on a 45 for the left downwind to Runway XX. After hearing their call; I made my crosswind call; and began to look for the traffic. I turned onto downwind; still looking for the Cherokee; and made my downwind call. At that time the Cherokee [pilot] made a call that they were entering the downwind and had 'traffic in sight;' which I assumed was me. At that time I did not have them in sight and stopped looking; assuming that the Cherokee [pilot] was maintaining separation with me. I reported midfield and heard the Cherokee within seconds also report midfield. I had a sinking feeling that something was not right and began looking for the Cherokee with my girlfriend's help. I couldn't see the Cherokee to my right; left; or behind me. I looked up in the skylights and saw the Cherokee approximately 50 feet above and slightly ahead of me descending. At that time I immediately descended and exited the pattern; briefly said some unfriendly but radio appropriate words to the Cherokee; came back around and re-entered the pattern from a 45 for the left downwind to Runway XX.I think the largest factor in the near-miss was my assumption that the Cherokee did indeed have me in sight and would maintain separation with me; with other contributing factors including myself flying a high wing aircraft looking for low wing traffic above me; creating a situation where we were both in each other's blind spots. A lesser factor; in my opinion; was a language barrier between myself and the Cherokee [pilot]. I suspect the Cherokee [pilot] might not have fully understood what he was saying; which goes back into my bad assumption that the Cherokee [pilot] indeed had me in sight and was maintaining separation. In the future I need to be more vigilant in the traffic pattern; especially at ZZZ which is a very busy GA airport. Most of my flying has been done at a Bravo airport and traffic separation is the responsibility of ATC. I can also be more forward with my CTAF communication and ask the pilot if he indeed has me in sight and is maintaining proper separation.",,,,"C150 pilot reported a NMAC while in traffic pattern at a non-towered airport.",

She was being vectored to a left heading of 040 to set up for the ILS XX at ZZZ. I watched her turn past her heading. I told her to turn back. She continued to the left. I was starting to question if her heading was really that off or if we were experiencing a vacuum failure. She said your flight controls. I took over but was already getting disoriented when I took the controls and struggled to regain control of the aircraft. My student became afraid we could stall; although we were not slow. She pushed the controls forward. We lost about 1;500 feet in a turn before regaining control of the aircraft. I feel that my student became spatially disoriented while I fell behind what was happening due to my questioning of the instruments. We lost altitude due to the unusual attitude. She and I are both current instrument rated pilots. She passed a check ride [a few months ago]. I passed a multi-commercial check ride [a few months ago]. We have both flown approaches since then. Neither of us had been in an unusual attitude in actual conditions before. We did unusual attitudes on a simulator the next day. We will both do it in the plane as soon as weather and schedule permits.",,"I was working on my commercial rating; but the ceilings were too low to do maneuvers. I still needed total time and I was scheduled to fly the next day for a fly-out; and I had never flown that airplane before; so we decided to take that airplane IFR to familiarize ourselves with it. My instructor had never flown that particular airplane IFR. I was; and am; a VERY low-time pilot in actual IMC. We decided to shoot one approach. ATC cleared us to 3;000 feet; heading 090; with vectors for the ILS XX. We entered the clouds at ~1;300 AGL. Everything went well initially; but early on I asked my CFI to be in charge of tuning radios and putting things into the GPS because I knew it would task-saturate me. However; I continued to talk on the radios. I turned left to a heading of 100 at ATC's instruction; and leveled out at 3;000 feet. While finishing my briefing of the approach; ATC gave me another turn to the left; and I blew past the heading because I was fixating on the gradual descent shown on the VSI. With the airplane in a left descending turn and ATC talking on the radio directing us to turn back to the right; I began to feel disoriented and uncomfortable; and I gave the controls to my CFI. She said; 'What are you doing? Are you okay?' and I said something like; 'I feel a little disoriented; please take the controls' and she said 'I have the controls'.We proceeded to enter an unusual attitude with a steeply banked right turn; according to the attitude indicator. My CFI called ATC and told them that we were having trouble; and that we had lost our vacuum pump. I looked at the vacuum gauge and it was in the green; I told my instructor the vacuum looked like it was working and I thought we were in an unusual attitude. I began to panic and completely lost my scan. At some point; hearing the panic also in my CFI's voice; I decided to take the controls again; but said nothing. Based on engine noise and afraid of deteriorating airspeed/impending stall; I pushed the stick forward. That must have put us into a dive because a few seconds later I heard the engine getting loud so I pulled the throttle back and looked at the ASI; which showed an IAS of ~130 MPH...in the yellow arc... so I began to bring the airplane back to a level pitch. I felt we were level again in controlled flight and began looking for the ground - I announced as I soon as I could see the ground; and leveled out under the clouds. ATC began to vector us to ZZZ at our request; then vectored us back to ZZZ1 when we changed our mind. We realized we did not know the weather at ZZZ and we did not want to fly back into the clouds inadvertently.We flew back to ZZZ1 at 1;400 feet MSL without incident; staying visual; and landed.Factors involved in this loss of control / unusual attitude in IMC incident were as follows:1. Pressure to fly to build total time.2. Pressure to fly this particular aircraft since I was scheduled in it the next day and had never flown it before.3. Me being a low-time pilot; and an extremely low-time actual IMC pilot.4. Me having never flown this particular aircraft; and having done all my IFR training in a C-172; which has very different control feel compared to a C-150.5. Me relying on my CFI to be able to get me out of trouble.6. My CFI being relatively unfamiliar with the incident aircraft and not having any IFR experience in it; and having most of her recent experience in 172's as well.7. My CFI relying on me to not get myself into trouble and getting 'behind' the situation.8. Overcast at 1;300 feet AGL; hard IMC conditions at the time of loss of control.9. Possible temporary loss of the vacuum system.10. Panicking - on my part and my CFI's11. Failing to maintain an instrument scan leading up to the incident and while I was panicking.12. Failure on my part to uphold the initial 'positive transfer of control' - since I took the controls back without speaking and we were probably both trying to control the aircraft at that point / loss of trust in my CFI to recover the situation when I heard her panicking.13. Mild fatigue on my part - I had slept for maybe 5-6 hours the night before; which is not quite enough for me in general.14. Task saturation on my part - inability to think about briefing the approach; talk on the radio to ATC; and maintain my scan / control the aircraft.The only factor in our favor about this event was that we had a 1;300 feet ceiling; no adverse weather conditions; and no rising terrain or obstructions.The best way to prevent this would have been to realize that it was stupid; especially as a low-time pilot; to take an unfamiliar airplane (both in terms of model of airplane and avionics on board) into actual IMC without practicing in it first under the hood in VMC [and] learning the control pressures and the avionics in a safer environment. We should have stayed on the ground. We could have flown the simulator to build time. Better ways to respond as the situation unfolded would have been for me to turn ALL non-flying tasks over to my CFI (better Crew Resource Management) when we entered the clouds so I could concentrate 100% on flying the airplane. When I first began to feel disoriented; I could have taken a deep breath; leveled the wings; and continued a careful scan; before worrying about ATC's instructions. After my CFI took the controls; she could have done the same thing - leveled the airplane and made sure she had positive aircraft control before trying to comply with ATC's directive to turn right. In the middle of it; I do not know if I should have taken the controls back or not from my instructor; because I do not know if she had positive aircraft control or not; but I should have said something about it. It was dangerous for me to make control inputs based on engine noise alone while in a (literally) blind panic. We were lucky to survive. Other ways to prevent future such incidents; besides the above; is to pay very close attention to the IMSAFE and PAVE checklists before each flight; especially IMC flights. I plan to gain more actual IMC time in familiar airplanes with CFI's who are also very familiar with the given airplane in IFR situations. I plan to never take an unfamiliar airplane or avionics suite into actual IMC before flying a proficiency check under the hood in VMC or a proficiency check in IMC with an instructor who is high-time in that airplane. I will maintain my proficiency by flying MANY more approaches/holds/etc.; per 6 months than are prescribed to stay legal as an instrument pilot. I will maximize my crew resources as needed to ensure that I can maintain aircraft control and not task-saturate. In general; I will avoid single-pilot IFR/IMC operations until I have a few hundred hours of actual IMC time. I also need to train myself to think rationally and maintain an instrument scan even in high-stress situations - this will be harder to do.",,"C150 student and instructor reported becoming disoriented and entering an unusual attitude in IMC conditions during practice instrument approach.",

Student pilot replied 'unable 2500 after 60 seconds'. ATC did not acknowledge; but then gave two vectors to what I (the CFI) believed to be the other conflicting aircraft). 2 minutes later (approaching 3000 MSL) ATC queried our altitude and repeated the 2500 MSL restriction. I replied (as CFI) to ATC that we were unable to maintain that altitude because we needed to cross the water at a higher altitude. I heard in background a 'traffic alert' and the controller then called traffic '1-2 o'clock'. I sighted the traffic which was slightly moving in the windscreen; but not much. Possibly on collision course. I took the aircraft from the student and rolled a 45 degree right bank turn in VMC; reduced power and descended about 200 feet. I then called to ATC that traffic was in sight; no longer a factor; and I would keep in sight.I resumed the climb toward 4500 and crossed the water climbing through about 3300 MSL.

I could see the edge of the cloudy area and decided to descend in a river valley to below the ceiling for the remaining 25 miles to my destination. Soon after entering below the ceiling; I could not maintain the required cloud clearance/terrain obstruction clearance. To avoid further descent; and assessing that a 180 turn was not possible due to terrain; I began a climb in the direction of the river valley. I entered IMC and broke out about 500' higher.This situation reflects poor judgment on my part and arose because of an incorrect assumption I had about what was under the cloud layer. My home base is in this area and I expected to see the usual; well-defined ceiling with good visibility underneath. This was not the case in this circumstance.I am well aware that continued VFR into IMC is a leading cause of fatal GA accidents.

ATC instructed me to stay at or above 600 feet; so that an inspection truck could enter onto the runway. I initially was confused and asked them to repeat a second time. They did and I read back the instructions. I still was a little confused; but thought they were instructing me to land at a steeper descent rate. I was used to hearing the term 'go around' and by hearing 'at or above 600 feet' didn't match with what I normally heard in the past. So maintaining 600 feet or above would have resulted in me 'going around' and I just didn't understand. When ATC realized that I wasn't complying; they asked the inspection truck to 'hold short' of the runway and no incident resulted. I reviewed the Pilot Controller Glossary and we weren't able to find the phrase 'restricted low approach at or above 600 feet'. Although; it was found in the Air Traffic Controller's Handbook (7110.65). But as my instructor suggested; it seems like it's asking a lot for a student pilot to review the ATC handbook. I found this to be a very confusing instruction when I was in a phase of flight; which required my complete attention on landing the airplane. For me; as a student pilot; is still a very new experience.I'm really sorry! I definitely understand the instructions now and won't make that mistake in the future.

He did not comply with the clearance and elected to continue his approach for a touch and go. ATC saw that he was not complying with the clearance and instructed the city vehicle to hold short of his runway.As the instructor; I clearly failed in my duty to ensure that he was familiar with this clearance. However; I must also add that it is a rather confusing instruction and one that is not used very often. I have since polled several pilots and many of them find it a confusing instruction. I have talked extensively with this student. We have discussed the Pilot Controller Glossary and I have tested him on several of the phrases. I have also made it very clear; and I believe he understands; that a pilot cannot under any circumstances occupy a runway until he hears phrases that involve the word 'cleared' and the runway name. I have also re-insisted that he inform every controller he interacts with that he is a student pilot on the initial call.

Prior to the roll-out; the aircraft bounced lightly once on landing; the bounce was corrected with some power and another flare and landed without another bounce. During the roll-out the aircraft maintained runway center-line briefly and then began a slight right turn. Left rudder pedal pressure was applied in an attempt to correct the turn. The aircraft continued to turn right; with the rate of turn increasing rapidly. In response; more left rudder pedal pressure was applied and left brake was momentarily activated but quickly released. Aircraft continued the right turn off the runway; control could not be regained.The cause of the incident may have been due to shifting winds that were not observed during the roll-out. Winds on the field were light but were enough to cause an issue with the aircraft during roll-out. The aircraft listed is a C150 with a tail-wheel conversion.Typically; no brake pressure is applied during the roll-out until after a significant decrease in speed is observed; hence no brake pressure being applied sooner during the roll-out. This is to prevent flipping the aircraft onto its back and/or to prevent pilot induced oscillations leading to a ground loop and/or subsequent loss of control.In retrospect; when the aircraft began its turn to the right; the left rudder pedal pressure applied was the correct measure. However; with the turn rate increasing; left brake pressure should have been applied sooner to arrest the turn.","Reporter stated wind shift more then likely was the cause; possible tail wheel was not aligned correctly; propeller damaged.",,,"Cessna 150 pilot reported a loss of aircraft control during landing resulting in a runway excursion.",

Then; I attempted to contact a Tower; where I still could not hear their transmissions. I still flew the last assigned heading and altitude. Fortunately; I had received the telephone number for a different Control Tower on a previous flight. I used that number to call from my cell phone. I explained my situation and asked them for the phone number for my destination Control Tower. I also told them to contact my destination Tower and tell them to expect an airborne phone call from me. If I couldn't reach them by telephone; I told them that I would then squawk 7600 on the transponder; fly direct to the Initial Approach Fix for the ILS approach; and then fly the ILS approach.On my first attempt to call; my cell phone reception was dropped. I then squawked 7600 and turned to intercept the IAF. After a few minutes; my cell phone reception improved and I called again. The Control Tower gave me a landing clearance over the phone; and I flew the ILS approach.

If I had not been able to contact them; I would have had no way of finding the phone number for the other Tower; unless I tried reaching a Flight Service Station by phone.In order to make this information more quickly accessible to pilots in an emergency; I would like to suggest publishing the phone number for an airport's control tower in the 'communications' section of the airport's A/FD page.",,,,"A Cessna pilot reported losing radio communications with ATC but was able to contact the Tower on their cell phone for an approach clearance.",

Generally; on the well-drained strips - conditions were expected to be firm with very short grass which has not started to grow significantly in the spring.An online brief (Foreflight) indicated VFR over the whole planned route with generally light SW to SE winds. Temperature was 12-15C across the area and Density Altitudes were - minus 100ft to 200ft depending on airport elevation and temperature. No Airport/Navigation NOTAMS of significance or TFR's.Worst case Performance Calculation for standard day / sea level / maximum gross was 1400ft to clear 50ft. Add 20% for grass 1;700 ft. The plane was not at maximum gross as there was no passenger. On full fuel departure from -ZZZ1 the plane had 128lb usable load remaining. At time of incident with 6 gallons burned off 144lb usable remaining. The Cessna 150 performance is particularly sensitive to loading at near maximum gross. In line with my personal minimum for flying grass strips - I have the plane at no more than 80% usable load used. (Usable load is 504 lb). And as we move into warmer weather with higher density altitudes - this was a last chance to fly all these strips till the fall when temperatures cool again. I don't consider this factor a pressure to 'complete the mission'. It was a nice day - I had plenty of local airports to choose from. On departure from ZZZ1 - I confirmed the plane was performing well and it broke ground into a Vy climb at 800ft of runway used. This is a deliberate check I use to for aircraft and personal performance at the start of this kind of flying.ZZZ is private owned. The airport is just inside the ZZZ2 Class Delta and a clearance is required from ZZZ2 to transition to the airport. This was easily given as the active runway at ZZZ2 was 15. This was influenced more by construction work at ZZZ2 than wind direction.ZZZ permits public use though PPL is required. I have PPL which is good for a year and had previously flown this airport. The Runway X/XX was firm; dry and grass was very short. It undulates slightly. Wind was almost square across the runway and 40ft pine trees were sheltering the runway from this cross wind. Based on the general wind across the region - I expected to use Runway XX. On making a 45 right downwind entry the midfield windsock indicated a steady 5-10 knots and slightly but positively favored 06. I modified my pattern and landed 06 informing ZZZ2 Tower of my status on final and intention to land and stay on the ground for 'about an hour'. This was acknowledged. I came in over trees and easily stopped normally in 1;100ft without having to perform a maximum performance short field landing. Book for over 50ft is 1;075ft at maximum gross/sea level. I performed another full preflight of the aircraft. Engine oil was at the same 5 qt level as when I departed ZZZ1. Fuel was approximately 6 gallons used since full - checked with dipstick - though hard to gauge accurately due to field slope. But there was positively enough fuel for the mission. Level matched engine run time since departing ZZZ1. Fuel is not a factor.On departure the wind remained square to the runway but the sock suggested XX was perhaps slightly more favored. This correlated with the wind field in the area and the adjacent ZZZ2. I watched the windsock carefully during the normal run up as I'm always concerned when wind is essentially 90 degree cross wind to the active. After observing during preflight and run up I judged that as I broke out of the shelter of the trees on the upwind side of the runway - XX would be the preferred runway and give me a slight headwind component. This was essentially the same decision I made when I last flew the field and had no problem climbing out from Runway XX.No flaps were used per Owner's Manual and experience. The Owner's Manual notes that flaps 10 gets the plane to break ground quicker but does nothing to help you climb over an obstacle. From practice - this is also my experience.A first take off attempt was a rolling turn onto the Runway XX at maximum length. I got the plane in ground effect OK but the undulations in the field did not synchronize with the plane well and a couple of gear touches slowed acceleration. As I passed a partial gap in the trees on the left midfield - I was twisted into wind a little. I was only at 40 KIAS (I rotate at 60KIAS to be sure of a positive rate of climb) and half runway was used. I kicked the plane to align with the runway again; closed the throttle; put the plane back down; easily braked and taxied back. I was not concerned about performance as such. Another run and timing of the undulations should yield a better result.The second take off attempt was much better. I was 40KIAS at 1/3rd field used and had not been slowed by gear touching undulations. I did not get twisted by wind at the gap in the trees and the plane was at 60 KIAS - my rotation speed at 50% field used. The plane rotated normally and I put the plane in a 54 KIAS Vx climb. The plane was positively climbing out the field and I just needed to follow Vx for a good departure. I usually do this by a mixture of attitude; checking the ASI (Airspeed Indicator) and from very faint squeaks from the stall warning horn. I am very aware it is important to rapidly lower the nose slightly if needed to keep flying rather than the alternate of pulling back too hard and sinking in. As I cleared the trees on my left - one of two things happened. EITHER - a rotor of wind from the trees sank me in - OR I was actually slightly in a downwind situation and the plane gave the appearance of sinking. I was certainly not convinced I was going to clear the trees at the departure end of the runway and a second 'sink' would mean I would not.I had to make a snap decision and I used my regularly practiced 'engine out on take-off / runway remaining' drill. With about 1/3rd runway remaining - I chopped power; kicked a very hard left forward slip and planted the plane back on the runway. Without flaps it sank on good and hard - it did not bounce and I was kicked reasonable square with no side loads as I touched down. However it was a hard touchdown. I was aiming for maximum braking action. I yoked back hard for aerodynamic braking and hit the brakes. With the fence coming up and a collision inevitable I deliberately tried a ground loop to the left to try and avoid hitting it. I managed about 120 degrees of the loop before running out of room and slowly hit the fence in the side/corner of the runway - to my left. Plane was not moving fast; my harness did not even need to restrain me but the fence wire tangled and stopped the prop and I can only assume the (now dented) right wing tip hit the fence post which broke.I was able to push the plane back off the fence so the wing overhanging was not blocking the trail immediately outside the fence.There were oil fumes under the cowl - though the engine dipped normal oil which was same as at departure. One prop blade (the tangled one) is slightly bent back in a curve. Left gear leg looks over cambered and might be loose in gear box. Right wing tip has a dent. Cowl is distorted - wonder if the firewall is distorted. Not sure at time of report. Waiting A&P inspection.The engine rotated freely and with no other way to get the plane off the runway - it started normally and I taxied it gently back to the tie downs.On the first attempt - the climb into ground effect did not synchronize with the undulations of the strip which hindered acceleration. The pivoting into wind as I passed the gap in the trees was more than expected. With plenty of runway remaining - stopping and trying again was valid.On the second take off performance was nominal and the plane achieved expected Vx performance at approximately 1;000ft runway used. As the plane cleared the sheltering tree line to the left it experienced EITHER - a sink from rotors of wind in the lee of the trees that sank it towards the ground. OR I was not slightly upwind as expected and was actually downwind. The plane may have not sunk in this scenario - but visually would have the appearance of doing so as carried towards the trees.I have always had a healthy respect for runways with sheltering trees and square crosswinds that can end up being up or downwind as you clear the trees. Plenty of them out in the Midwest! As a result I spend some time considering take offs in this situation. If local pilots are available (not on this day) I seek opinions as to what is 'normal' in the prevailing conditions - though ultimately the decision is mine.In the event that my abort had been successful with no damage I would not have attempted the takeoff on Runway XX again that day. I would have checked with the owners and if agreeable; made a PIC decision to take off on the closed; mown; downhill and into wind runway that is used as a taxiway and is only closed to keep the peace with the neighboring golfers.",,,,"C150 pilot reported after liftoff the aircraft was not going to clear tree line.

I was number two on 2-3 mile final at about 900 feet. The aircraft in front of me reported '[Callsign] going missed' and immediately made a hard right turn and climb. I immediately queried them as to the reason of their go-around due to the notable evasive action. They responded that traffic [an Ercoupe] had just passed underneath them. I immediately began a climbing right turn to attempt to avoid the traffic; which I could not see. About 15 seconds later; I sighted the Ercoupe coming straight at me; about 100 feet below. I initiated an immediate climb to build space. They passed underneath me and continued through the final approach course. At the point of closest approach; I estimate the Ercoupe passed within 100 feet horizontally and 200 below me. Following the miss; I reported the position of the Ercoupe to JVL tower (they had asked the Ercoupe where they were and the Ercoupe had not responded) and rejoined final for a landing.I believe what caused the issue was the Ercoupe incorrectly reporting their position throughout their attempt to land at JVL and the tower's lack of radar capability. The Ercoupe reported numerously that he was in the left downwind for 22; when in reality it appears he was in a very wide left downwind for 36. Because tower only could rely on the position reports coming from the aircraft (which were incorrect); they had no idea where the Ercoupe was until we reported his position heading directly up the final approach course. To rectify this issue; I believe that the tower at Janesville needs increased surveillance capabilities and as always pilots need to remain proficient in their ability to navigate the airport environment. Of note is the fact another NMAC occurred a couple minutes later at JVL involving two separate aircraft (described in another report from one of the pilots involved); which I believe can also be partially attributed to the tower not being able to keep up with the traffic due to lack of radar capability and the base turns being pushed 3+ miles from the airport; making it hard for tower to keep up with who was who.",,,,"Cessna pilot reported an NMAC with an aircraft that did not know where it was at and had reported a different position in the traffic pattern of JVL.",

The Cessna 150 aircraft had performed as expected for the entirety of the flight leading up to this event. ZZZ was the point of intended landing for a fuel stop. Preflight planning calculations indicated that the flight would require approximately 18 gallons of fuel. With 22.5 gallons of usable fuel on board; the night VFR reserve fuel requirements were met. On initial approach to the airport the engine begin running rough and losing power. Several adjustments were made to remedy the situation; including several restart attempts. Ultimately these efforts proved unsuccessful and the engine lost all power. Given the current winds aloft; distance from the field; and gliding characteristic; it quickly became apparent that landing at the airport would not be a possible option. Upon descending towards an open field; a nearby road appeared as the best viable option to land the aircraft. After touchdown the aircraft rolled to a stop on the side of the county road. There was no injury or damage to any persons or property. Local authorities assisted with securing the aircraft for the night in a nearby opening. The following morning a mechanic inspected the aircraft for possible defects and it was determined that the aircraft was exhausted of fuel. Upon replenishing the fuel tanks with gas; several engine test runs were conducted. The mechanic concluded that there was an issue with the fuel and/or carburetor system and the engine controls were providing an inherently rich fuel mixture. This defect created an excess fuel burn that was undetectable upon preflight inspection. The excess fuel burn rate had caused the engine to deplete the extra fuel throughout the flight and starve the engine of gas causing the engine out situation. The fuel level gauges were also discovered to be displaying inaccurate information. It was noted that the engine tachometer could also possibly be off by 100 rpm. These undetectable circumstances lead to misleading information about the engine performance and fuel status. In the end it was a successful emergency landing with absolutely no damage or injury whatsoever. The aircraft will be scheduled for maintenance; further inspection; and repair in order to remedy all discrepancies and return to service.",,,,"C-150 Pilot experienced in flight engine failure.",

It is a tail dragger.[In the morning during our flight; CFI A] was demonstrating a soft field takeoff at a private turf strip. The 2000 foot runway condition was recently mowed and dry. During the takeoff roll [CFI A] held the tail down; [CFI A] was unable to achieve sufficient airspeed during the takeoff roll. Two thirds down the runway he jerked the flaps from 0 to 30 degrees.

We never got above 20 foot AGL and he was unable to gain any additional airspeed and eventually fully stalled the plane into the corn field about one half mile from our departure point. The engine was producing full power and the fuel was about 1/2 full in each tank. There were no injuries but significant damage was done to the airframe and power plant.[CFI A] was deep into the reverse region of command where there was no escape.

After doing the pre-flight check; everything appeared to be in working order. I taxied the airplane slowly from FBO1 to FBO2 for fuel. So it maybe took me about 0.3 or 0.4 hour from engine start because I needed to wait for the fuel person. After refilling; I taxied to the run up area with full fuel. My destination airport was ZZZ1. After taking off; the engine [shuddered] suddenly; I checked all the engine gauges but everything was good. Few minutes later; the engine [was] back to normal. It took me about 1.8h to ZZZ1 which was less than what I planned. So I didn't think I needed additional fuel. I made a full stop for the restroom.After a few minutes rest; I took off from ZZZ1. I picked another route. At the start of the flight everything worked; but when I flew above ZZZ2; the engine started [shuddering] again. I tried to find out what the problem weas but everything still looked good. And the engine stopped [shuddering] few minutes later. I checked the fuel gauges and I[recall] that it showed me 1/4 per tank (about 5.6 gallons in total). It was enough for me to fly back to ZZZ.After the radar service [was] terminated by Approach; I got the landing clearance from ZZZ Tower. At the time I was descending to 2000ft; my engine started to lose power with RPM dropping. I noticed the fuel gauges still showed me 1/4 per tank. I tried to restart the engine but I failed. I talked to ZZZ Tower immediately for emergency landing. Fortunately I landed on Taxiway A. I really appreciate ZZZ Tower's help. I didn't know what the problems were. But [when] I turned on the battery again the fuel gauges showed completely different. Left tanks showed the fuel almost empty (maybe 0.5-1 gallon I thought). Right one still showed 1/4 (approximately 2.5 gallons). The total fuel of the flight on my flight plan in day VFR is 22.17 gallons. I made a perfect flight plan; but I didn't realized my flight cannot be [done within] that time. I ignored other factors. Also under the influence of the fuel gauges. I made a bad decision.

I was asked to do a 360 and rejoin base leg which I started. I didn't like the setup for landing so I requested to rejoin downwind instead of base and was granted that. As I was turning back to downwind (almost at the point where I would have to turn base); another IFR plane approached and was cleared for landing. Again I had to maneuver for spacing. I joined base and turned on final when I noticed I had full flaps; a low power setting; carb heat and was below glide path. My airspeed had decayed to between 40 and 45 MPH (my Cessna is calibrated in MPH; not KPH which is below published stall speed. I was also in a bank to align with the runway. I added power; retracted some flaps and made a normal landing. I was lucky. I should have been in a stall/spin at an altitude too low to recover. When talking to the Tower; I was paying more attention to trying to accommodate them than I was to flying the airplane and it almost cost me my life. I didn't reconfigure the plane for normal flight and I didn't take into account that I had been descending from pattern altitude or had flaps and carb heat on since reducing power on downwind so my 360 was performed at too low an altitude and with the wrong configuration of the airplane. In retrospect; and in the future; I will request vectors out of the traffic pattern so I can rejoin and make a stabilized approach. I was a student pilot in the 1990's so I know training has changed since then; but during the stall recovery training; the scenarios were power on stalls; wings level; and power off stalls; again with wings level. Training at altitude for this type of scenario where the student is presented with a pattern altitude above 3;000 feet AGL then asked to make changes and trained to reconfigure the plane would be a life saver. My scenario was pretty much the same as the Cirrus that spun in at Houston Hobby airport. The difference is my plane is much more forgiving than a Cirrus. Given the number of stall/spin accidents; I think training needs to be updated to make the pilots much more aware of potential problems before they can happen. Another possible improvement; if it isn't already implemented; would be for air traffic controllers to get some sort of training on where the most critical areas of flight are (low altitude; low power; flaps down). I want to stress that this situation is in NO WAY the controllers fault or responsibility. They can't fly the plane for me. I'm not sure what; if anything; could be gained by this training but I put it out there for thought.",,,,"Pilot flying C-150 allowed airspeed to decay on approach to landing.",

There was no intention to fly. After approximately one hour of discussing how ground handling a tailwheel aircraft is different from a tricycle gear aircraft; the pilots boarded the aircraft and the CFI called Ground Control to establish an acceptable location to taxi. Ground Control instructed the aircraft to taxi on the [1; 2 and 3] taxiways and remain south of [4] taxiway (and clear of all runways). While taxiing within this area; the Private Pilot and the CFI transferred control back-and-forth several times as the unique handling characteristics of the tailwheel aircraft were demonstrated and observed. After approximately 15 minutes of taxiing; the Private Pilot attempted to turn left from [taxiway 1] to [taxiway 2]. During this turn; it is estimated that the aircraft was traveling approximately 8mph when the Private Pilot lost control and the aircraft veered sharply to the left. The CFI attempted to correct by exclaiming 'My airplane!' and applying right rudder and right brake. The CFI also attempted to reduce power since the Private Pilot was adding power through the turn. The Private Pilot; however; did not immediately relinquish control and briefly resisted the CFI's efforts. After a brief moment; the Private Pilot relinquished the controls and the CFI was able to prevent a ground loop but the aircraft had already departed the taxiway into the grass. With the engine at idle and with hard braking; the CFI was simply unable to get the aircraft to stop in time before striking the taxiway sign. Unbeknownst to the Private Pilot and the CFI; the registration status of this aircraft had been changed to 'deregistered' the day before the event. The owner of the aircraft had been trying to renew the registration for a number months with the FAA returning the application multiple times. From what I understand; the owner accidentally let the registration lapse [many months earlier]. When he attempted to renew shortly thereafter; the application was rejected since it was now a new registration and not a renewal. This rejection took several weeks. The new application was submitted along with payment. The check used to pay for the registration cleared the bank [a couple months ago]. Knowing that the FAA is 6-8 weeks behind in processing registrations; we continued to look at the FAA website to monitor status. The night before the event; the owner looked at the website to see that the registration status still had not changed. With the cancelled check and the delay in processing; it was believed that the aircraft was properly registered and that some taxiing exercises would not be an issue. It was not until after the mishap that it was brought to our attention that the new application was again rejected and the aircraft status had changed to deregistered.",,,,"C140 Instructor reported taxiway excursion resulted in aircraft striking taxiway sign.",

The coordination on the VFR strip stated he was going to be headed to Kihei for fish spotting. Once he was in his right turn SE bound; I switched him to departure. As he approached the outer boundary of Kahului's Class C airspace; his squawk code changed to 1200. Meanwhile; Aircraft Y was on the RNAV Z approach to Runway 2; and was east of the airport on the right downwind. The 1200 code; which was Aircraft X; started to circle back towards the airport and appeared to be making a 5 mile straight in for Runway 2 as Aircraft Y was on a 5 mile right base. I picked up the binoculars and spotted Aircraft X pointed at the airport. I then noticed that Aircraft Y was high at about 3;600 feet. While this was taking place; the Cab Coordinator (CC) was on the line with approach discussing Aircraft X's priority status. Aircraft Y was being sent around. Aircraft X checked in on my frequency on about a 4 mile final. I cleared him to land Runway 2 and issued the winds at the approach end. He said he was unsure if he would be able to make it to the airport. I asked for the nature of his situation. He said his engine was in rough shape and it was not looking good. I advised him that rescue vehicles would be standing by. The Supervisor on duty worked to get a hold of crash fire rescue on ground frequency as well as the crash phone. Aircraft X's transmissions were coming in partially broken and it was tough to understand at times what he needed and what exactly the problem was. I issued a cautionary wake turbulence advisory for the Aircraft Y aircraft that had passed above him. Aircraft X landed safely on Runway 2 and exited at F to parking. He was met by rescue vehicles on the East Ramp. A follow up Runway inspection was performed by operations to make sure the Runway was clear of debris and ready for use. No separation was lost and all aircrafts made it to their destinations safely.During an emergency; it is important that everyone in the tower cab be made aware of the emergency and which aircraft is experiencing it. Although the cab coordinator and myself were aware of the emergency; and the OS and Ground Controller became aware of it from overhearing our conversation; it would have been more beneficial for both the CC and I to announce to the rest of the cab; that Aircraft X was inbound as an emergency. That way we acquire extra human resources who can help us safely handle the dire situation with many moving parts. I do not believe there was anything I could do to prevent the emergency; but I do believe that my coordination with my team members could have been better. I also think I could have slowed down the operations at the airport. While Aircraft X was inbound with the emergency; I was still departing aircraft. This forces the extra workload on my CC as well as the coordinating sectors who will be affected by having to work the departures. Although no aircraft were put at risk; it may be wiser in the future to minimize my amount of work and put my full focus into providing the best service I possibly can; to any emergency aircraft.",,,,"OGG Tower Controller reported a VFR aircraft had to return due to a engine that was rough running which caused an aircraft to be resequenced.",

After several minutes a 'whooshing' sound developed very lightly in my headset. I tried to see if any instrumentation had an indication that aligned with the rhythmic sound in my headset. With no further indications of problems (no warning lights; no ammeter issues; no vacuum or oil pressure issues; I continued on to ZZZ1.After receiving ATIS at ZZZ1; I called the Tower at 9.2 miles out to notify them of my intention to land at ZZZ1.I was asked to report a 2 mile left base for Runway XX. At 4.2 miles on my GPS (approximately 2.5 miles out from an extended base leg; I notified Tower that I was on an extended base to Runway XX. With no traffic in the area; ZZZ1 Tower cleared me to land for Runway XX.Almost immediately after I received the clearance to land and I acknowledged it; my instrument panel start to show signs of a power failure with the blinking of both my nav/comm radios and the loss of power to my portable avionics via the auxiliary/cigar lighter adapter. In an attempt to locate any issues; unplugged the adapter and left the portable avionics unpowered. I toggled the switch to the rotating beacon and began powering down the nav/com radios one at a time. Nothing improved the situation. The power plant continued to generate power; so being cleared to for landing and having the runway safely in sight; I continued my approach. I tried to put in flaps and noticed the motors sounding sluggish; so I stopped after 15 degrees of flap. The approach was normal and I landed safely on Runway XX at ZZZ1. I turned off the first taxiway that was to my left about halfway down the runway and moved off the active and stopped with my tail safely off the runway. My instrument panel and nav/com radios were completely dead. I have two portable radios and found that the batteries for both portable units did not contain enough charge to power the radio. I took out my cell phone and opened up the AOPA Airport app to see if I could locate the Tower phone number; but it was not listed. I kept looking at the Tower but my relative position to the Tower was skewed and without moving the aircraft further; I could not see the Tower for any light signals. My destination was [Company] to drop my plane off for an avionics upgrade; so I did have the phone number of [Company] on my phone. I called [Company] and asked him to contact the Tower and let them know of my dilemma. He said he would and I told him that I was going to cross the main taxiway and get on the service taxiway so that I would be in a position of less potential traffic conflict. I immediately proceeded to the service taxiway and proceeded to [Company] without delay.Upon arrival; [Company] indicated that he called the Tower and let them know of my issue.Things I learned that I need to do before my next flight...1. Always research the phone number of the Tower and have it close at hand 2. Test both portable comm radios before take off to assure that both are operational3.

I glanced down at the rudder pedals and it appears that one has broken and is jammed. I texted a picture of the rudder pedal & mechanical failure to my boss who is an A&P (Airframe and Powerplant) with IA (Inspection Authorization). He insisted that I must remove the rudder pedal/cotter pins to help him determine what is mechanically wrong. He insisted that this is legal since he's 'supervising' me and told me I can simply remove the rudder and fly the aircraft from the right seat back to my home airport. I told him I don't want to fly the aircraft and would prefer if he sent another aerial survey pilot or taxi to pick me up. He then insisted that I should try to remove the cotter pins while I wait for a taxi; and I proceeded with removing one. I took a break and consulted with other pilots who informed me that he physically has to be present for it to be legal for me to work on the aircraft; and that it is obviously not airworthy. I fortunately met another pilot at the airport who told me they would fly me back to my home airport where my car was and I gratefully accepted their invitation. After further research; I determined that this incident is required by the operator to be reported to the NTSB immediately since loss of flight controls was involved. I'm certain that my boss never reported this incident. In addition; I came to the conclusion that I could have unintentionally violated FARs by removing one of the rudders cotter pins.",,,,"C150 pilot reported a rudder pedal jammed during taxi; resulting in a complete loss of rudder control.",

Aircraft X is on downwind. Aircraft Y is on the 45; tucks in nicely behind Aircraft X on downwind with proper separation and radio calls. Aircraft X flies an exceptionally long downwind; nearly 2 NM past the runway threshold; for no apparent reason (no one ahead of them; no one waiting for takeoff). Radio calls from Aircraft X are unintelligible due to strong accent; neither pilot in Aircraft Y can understand them other than the name of the airport. Seeing Aircraft X so far out on downwind; not being sure if they were departing or just flying a huge pattern; Aircraft Y turns base at the normal time (roughly 0.5 NM past the runway threshold) and calls it out on CTAF. Appears to be plenty of spacing. Aircraft Y is not intending to 'cut off' Aircraft X. Plenty of time for Aircraft Y to land; touch-n-go; or go-around without impeding Aircraft X's plans at all. Remember; similar types; therefore similar speeds. With as little as 1 NM separation; that's a full minute in trail at a reasonable 150/152 approach speed of 60 kts; slightly less than a minute at let's say 70 kts. Nonetheless; someone might interpret Aircraft Y's action as taking 'advantage of this rule to cut in front of another which is on final approach to land or to overtake that aircraft;' (FAR 91.113) even though Aircraft X was not on final approach; and we (Aircraft Y) clearly were not 'overtaking' them. As soon as we started turning base; we noticed visually (since we could not understand their transmissions) that they turned base at roughly the same time. Here's where it gets crazy. We saw on our ADS-B In display that they were gaining on us while we were both on final approach. Not wanting to hold them up at all; we executed a go-around from roughly 200 feet AGL and announced our go-around on the CTAF. We then lost track of Aircraft X temporarily while focusing on the go-around procedure. Once we re-established ourselves on downwind; we noticed that Aircraft Y had come up behind us and was GAINING on us on downwind. Without any radio calls from Aircraft X; to boot! We in Aircraft Y were making the usual radio calls 'turning crosswind;' 'turning downwind;' 'on downwind.' Nothing but silence from Aircraft X. Our ADS-B In told us they were same altitude and ZERO NM behind us. My student looked back and did catch a glimpse of them; not sure how far behind. On flightradar24; it appears Aircraft X caught up with Aircraft Y to within 1/2 NM; although I suspect it was even closer. With both of us confused and getting nervous; my student elected to depart the pattern on effectively a downwind departure; and I agreed. I instructed full power; carb heat off; flaps up to give us a chance of outrunning the closing Aircraft X aircraft behind us. We announced our departure on CTAF and turned slightly right in case Aircraft X simply did not see us (fat chance). That way; we would be out of their way if they continued straight on the downwind. Our tactic did manage to provide some extra distance from Aircraft X; but get this - Aircraft X turned slightly right just like we did and appeared to be chasing us! Again; flightradar24 shows these maneuvers clearly. After a few seconds; Aircraft X appeared to give up the chase and returned via a slight left turn back to the downwind while we climbed out on the heading discussed above (approximately 20 degrees east of the downwind heading). Again; we called our position and intentions on the CTAF stating that there was a traffic conflict we were unable to resolve; so we were exiting the pattern to the <direction>. In my opinion as pilot in command; the closing-from-behind aircraft presented a clear and present danger. While I did not advise ATC (nor were we in contact with any ATC facility to declare to); I exercised my authority per FAR 91.3(b) to the extent required to meet the situation. Thus; the non-standard exit from the traffic pattern; in other words not one of the exits recommended by AC 90-66B(or whatever suffix it' s up to nowadays).",,,,"Flight Instructor reported a NORAD aircraft in pattern traffic overtaking them resulted in pilot exiting traffic pattern to avoid conflict.",

There was a band of clouds on the route and as it was bumpy down low I wanted to climb up above the clouds and take advantage of the smooth air and hopefully a tailwind. I maneuvered a little to maintain VFR while climbing and eventually leveled out at 5;500 ft. MSL. I noted the lack of any distinct horizon to the north and northeast while to the south and southeast there was a horizon. It looked like the air to the north and northeast was trying to decide if it wanted to be a cloud or not. Since I could not determine distance and did not want to run into IMC I turned more eastward. About this time I caught a sudden movement out of the corner of my right eye. I first thought that it was extremely strange for a bird. I quickly turned and saw a skydiver; pilot chute deployed dragging the bag and risers out. I quickly turned my head to the left and noted a white square canopy fully deployed on my left side about 8 o'clock and lower. This scared me and I scanned rapidly for other canopies; not seeing any others. I have a Stratux for ADS-B in and I looked for traffic. I noted a contact about 2;600 ft. below and descending rapidly. I had not noticed him before and I guessed this was likely the jump plane. I had also immediately tuned into the CTAF to listen. I didn't hear any radio traffic. I am a USPA licensed sport parachutist with XXX jumps logged; though I haven't jumped in XX years or so. I fly very often by airports with jump activity and listen in for activity and give them a wide berth so as to avoid any unannounced activity. I have flown by ZZZ quite a few times; in fact I had flown by on the way to ZZZ1 from ZZZ3 earlier. I had listened to the CTAF and there had been no activity in the 15 minutes or so I listened while I passed well to the east and southeast en route to ZZZ1. I wasn't thinking about that on my return trip. I believe I was pre-occupied with evaluating the clouds and clearance when I lost situational awareness and found myself over ZZZ. I'm not so sure that the conditions were good enough for skydiving given I could not see the airport. I continued on to ZZZ2 descending after passing by the band of clouds. My normal flying is all low in my Cessna 140 and I am rarely above 3000 ft. MSL. I am normally quite conscious of my position in relation to the airports I am near. I think it likely the distraction of getting above the clouds; loss of visual ground cues for my position and the unusual visibility contributed to loss of focus on remaining clear of ZZZ. I'm going to have to make a concerted effort to maintain situational awareness at all times.",,,,"C140 pilot reported an NMAC with a skydiver.",

I was PIC; Person Y was the only passenger. We had previously flown Aircraft X on July [date] 2020 from ZZZ; ZZZ4; ZZZ3 and had noted that the passenger door was not closing properly -- a small gap in the upper-left corner of the window frame allowed wind to enter the cabin. The owner of the plane investigated the issue then and found that the upper window frame was bent. I assumed that the issue was fixed by an A&P mechanic after the investigation. The plane has been regularly flown by other pilots since July.On November [date] 2020; I noticed no irregularities during pre-flight. During run-up; I noticed that the gap in the passenger door was still present and was a bit bigger than I remembered it from July. I thought that the slight wind in the cabin would be unpleasant but not otherwise an issue and continued with the flight. During the take-off roll just after rotation; the passenger door swung open. Once we were stabilized on the downwind; I shut the door and reassured my passenger. However the passenger door swung open again -- the wind through the upper-left gap torqued the entire door outward and that overpowered the door latch. So I requested landing clearance from ZZZ Tower and executed a precautionary landing without any incident. I taxied back to parking; shut off the engine and investigated the passenger door. The upper window frame was flexing slightly and could be bent to snap into the correct position. I pushed the frame into the correct position; verified that the frame was now snug against all the door frame inserts and that no wind was leaking into the cabin.I took off from ZZZ around XB:00 and noted no issues this time. As we were transitioning ZZZ3 Class D airspace; my passenger noted that she heard some sound from her door. I verified that the gap in the window frame was not present and that the door was shut properly. Shortly after we flew through the Class D; my passenger also reported that she could feel cold air from near the lower-right part of her door. As we flew past the marina; the door again swung open. This time the door shook violently which caused the window also to be flung open. I requested landing clearance from ZZZ3 was given priority and then I clarified my situation. I noted that reducing the throttle helped remove the violent door shaking. I reached over to shut the door; then pulled the upper window frame back into the door inserts and then closed the window. The ATC alerted me with a low altitude warning; so I decided to ignore the door and climb 300 ft. to intercept the glide slope and fly the plane first. As I increased RPM; the door again flung open. The door was twisting and wobbling around the hinge like a sheet of paper with the hinge as a paper-clip; and either wind or resonant frequency was increasing the severity of the wobbles. My passenger held the door to dampen its shaking. The landing at ZZZ3 was without any incident; and I taxied to a maintenance shop on the field. An A&P mechanic diagnosed that the passenger door needs to be replaced entirely and that the plane was not airworthy. We drove back to ZZZ after ensuring that the owner of Aircraft X knew what had happened and where to find the plane's key.In follow-up communication with the owner; I do not believe that the plane door was inspected and fixed by an A&P mechanic in July. The owner mentioned that he adjusted the door latches and attempted to bend the window frame back into place. This 'fix' ensured that the 'door shut properly 90% of the time'. He mentioned that he drove up to ZZZ3 with a spare C150 door and replaced it -- I do not know that he is qualified to make such repairs. His name does not show up in the airmen registry as holding an A&P license. The owner also mentioned that he was checking the door occasionally and that it had clearly worsened in the lastcouple of weeks and that there is no strength left in the window frame.Based on our conversations; I believe that the owner fixed the discrepancies that pilots reported using methods that are not by the book.(1) Normalization of deviance. I should have canceled the flight after landing at ZZZ after the initial trouble with the door.(2) Normalization of deviance. Owner should have replaced the door in July; rather than waiting for the door condition to get worse and create an [issue].(3) Crew management. I should have briefed my passenger during/after the [event]. She thankfully did all the right things (e.g. dampen the door vibrations) purely on instinct.(4) Aviate & Declare. I did not use 'emergency' or 'mayday' in my communications; despite that; the ATC at ZZZ and ZZZ3 both realized that something was up and gave me priority. Kudos to them. When diverting to ZZZ3; I flew very close to the prohibited airspace near marina to minimize my flight path to the runway.(5) Pre-flight Airworthiness Check. I should have insisted on viewing the maintenance records of the airplane to verify that my previous squawks were satisfactorily addressed.",,,,"C150 pilot reported multiple issues with the passenger door opening in flight on a rental plane.",

The lesson began normally with a preflight inspection by the student and an abbreviated inspection by myself; which showed no abnormality. There were five quarts of oil in the engine; I tightened the cap myself after double-checking. I personally watched the student add 10 gallons on fuel to the aircraft and sump uncontaminated fuel from both tanks immediately prior to flying. The run up was performed prior to takeoff with normal RPM drops on both magnetos and with application of carburetor heat. On takeoff the oil pressure and temperature read normal; and the engine was generating what appeared to be normal maximum power (~2;500 RPM). Takeoff and climb to the west were uneventful; with the student being the pilot flying. Several minutes into the flight I took the controls to demonstrate a maneuver. After performing a clearing turn at 3;000 ft. to prepare to demonstrate stalls to the student; I pressed the mixture in to prepare for full-power recovery from the maneuvers. Shortly after doing so; I noticed a drastic decrease in engine power (roughly 1;500 RPM maximum). After moving the throttle through most of its range to see if any setting would produce more power; I executed the engine failure checklist from memory (fuel on; mixture rich; carb heat on; magnetos on both; master on; primer in and locked). All items were configured correctly; I cycled each magneto individually to see if using one alone would produce more power; but this did not work. As I was doing this I was turning back toward land to the east and searching for a nearby grass runway. I requested priority handling to Approach; who assisted in locating ZZZ which was only several miles away and within gliding distance. A safe landing was made on the runway; which was in good condition and dry. When shutting down the aircraft; I noticed a sharp increase in RPM while pulling the mixture out to cutoff. I called the TRACON on the phone to let them know of our safe landing. After exiting the aircraft; I checked the oil level again; it was still at five quarts; and the cap had been tight. There was no obvious cause of the engine malfunction visible through the air inlets or the oil door. My student did find some acorns underneath the aircraft on the runway; the plane had recently undergone maintenance to remove debris in the engine cowling placed by squirrels that had gotten into the hangar. Several minutes after landing; deputies from the Sheriff's Department arrived to verify our safety; as they had been contacted by the approach controller. I was able to restart the aircraft normally; though in the full rich position the aircraft was not able to produce more than 1;500 RPM and ran very rough. With the mixture pulled out about two inches; I was able to generate a normal static RPM at full throttle. The aircraft was secured so that it could be inspected and repaired by the on-field A&P when he was available later in the week. I was informed by the student several days later that the mechanic found acorns in the air induction system.",,,,"Flight Instructor reported loss of engine power during a training flight which caused a diversion and a precautionary emergency landing.

We were practicing ground reference maneuvers; specifically S-turns across a road. Except we used the river as a 'road.' My thinking was that no traffic should be near us if we are 1;000 feet AGL (1;200MSL) at that location. Boy; was I wrong.My student had completed a few S-turns across the river and was just turning westbound to cross the river again when I noticed a target on our ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast) in display less than a mile to our right (north) -- actually; much less than a mile -- showing 100 feet below us; coming straight toward our right rear quarter. It looked like a 90-degree track compared to ours; meaning the offending aircraft was heading roughly 190 while we were heading approximately 270 (all magnetic). I took control immediately; raised the right wing; and looked intently to our right rear and all other parts of our right side in an effort to make visual contact. Alas; no joy.Since the ADS-B track showed he was likely to pass behind us; I went full throttle in order to give the other aircraft the best chance of doing so. That appeared to work; but we only knew that when the target (after what seemed like an eternity) moved to our left rear on its same heading. Finally; we were diverging. We both looked in the direction of the target; still no joy. Never saw the guy. Thank goodness for ADS-B in this case.Let me add that I was scanning for traffic the whole time my student was S-turning. Whenever he banked left; I took the opportunity to look under the raised (right) wing. When he turned right; the other raised wing. Nonetheless; no joy whatsoever.We were not monitoring any radio frequency at the time since we were not close to an airport traffic pattern nor in a designated practice area (the 'west practice area' near there is several miles west of our position). Now this: Thanks again to ADS-B; I was able to find both our flight tracks on FlightRadar24 (FR24). I identified the other aircraft's N-number; looked it up in the FAA database; found the owner's information; and called him. Nice; retired fellow on this third Cirrus; based at the airport 3 NM to our north-northeast; ZZZ. He had just departed ZZZ Runway XX and was climbing; per the FlightRadar24 track; via track 235 degrees at a ground speed of 132 knots. Our track at the time; per FlightRadar24; was 283 degrees with a ground speed of 71 knots. So roughly 50 degrees different in ground tracks; not 90 as estimated above.I asked the owner; who was the pilot in the Cirrus; if he saw us either visually or on ADS-B. He said he did not recall seeing us on either and that he did not get a traffic alert on his ADS-B device. I think we received an alert; but not positive in retrospect. I am just glad I glanced at the display when I did.The Cirrus pilot said that he always announces his takeoffs from ZZZ on the CTAF; which is Multicom 122.9. I admitted that I should have been monitoring that frequency for traffic awareness.I mentioned as gently as possible to him that the FAA recommends (via AC 90-66B; Non-Towered Airport Flight Operations) that airplanes departing a non-towered airport should fly straight out until reaching pattern altitude; then continue straight out or turn 45 degrees in the direction of the traffic pattern for that runway. This gentleman did neither. His FR24 shows that he went straight out off Runway XX for less than a mile; then turned 65 degrees!! To his right!! Even though Runway XX is a left-traffic runway. He did not seem impressed when I mentioned that to him; he was more eager to repeat that I should have been monitoring CTAF so we would have known he was departing.The upshot of our conversation for me was to guard the nearby CTAF whether or not I am in a location where I 'shouldn't' need to do so; and to realize that pilots operating at quiet; non-towered airports will do whatever they darned well please regardless ofany FAA guidance.Lastly; I offered to do his next flight review or IPC for free since I have never been in a Cirrus and would be eager to be his 'passenger.' Scolding him will not do any good; but perhaps by instructing him; should he decide to take me up on my offer; I may be able to remind him of proper non-towered airport procedures.",,,,"Instructor Pilot reported a NMAC.",

Since this was the student's 2nd training flight; I was explaining the correct traffic pattern entry and radio calls to him. I made the initial radio call 10 miles away from the airport and stated location; altitude and intentions. A short time later; a Mooney checked on to the CTAF and announced his location and intentions. I noted to myself that the Mooney was near us; but behind and decided to be vigilant. The wind favored landings on Runway XX that day; which meant that we would have to fly from the practice area to the northwest of the airport to an area southwest of the airport in order to make the 45 degree entry to the right traffic. I was a bit concerned as the student and I were flying in a Cessna 150 which is very slow and was worried about being overtaken by the faster Mooney as we both set up for the traffic pattern entry. I made my next radio call at a location approximately 4-5 miles northwest of the airport and stated that we intended to maneuver for the 45 degree entry to the traffic pattern. I also directed the student to descend to traffic pattern altitude. I continued to visually scan for the Mooney. Since I expected the Mooney to overtake us and since the right of way rules state that overtaking aircraft should pass on the right; I spent most of my time searching on our right. The pilot of the Mooney made a radio call and stated a position and distance from the airport that was very similar to ours. I became even more concerned about the possibility for a collision and made an additional radio call with our revised position and stated that we were in a Cessna 150; in an attempt to inform the Mooney pilot of our speed and the possibility for collision. The pilot of the Mooney made another radio call and stated his position; which was very similar to ours; 5 miles west of the airport. I became very concerned about the situation and began to aggressively scan for them. I didn't feel that it would be appropriate to divert towards the airport; as it would cause me to conflict with the traffic pattern. I also didn't feel that it would be appropriate to divert away from the airport; as I expected the Mooney to pass on the right. A very short time later; the Mooney passed by us on our left and slightly above us. It appeared to me that we were vertically separated by less than 200 feet and laterally separated by less than 200 feet.I realized after the fact; that I had allowed myself to continue into the possibility of a collision because I felt I had the right of way as the slower aircraft and because I did not want to cause my student an undue expense of maneuvering away from the airport. I noted that the other pilot made three radio calls that expressed essentially the same position and distance from the airport; yet I made no attempt to escape the situation. In the future; I will be more aggressive about maneuvering out of or away from potential traffic pattern conflicts.",,,,"Instructor Pilot reported a Near Mid Air Collision while on approach to landing.",

To make sure it was not just a problem with the lights at ZZZ1; I flew over to ZZZ2 and also could not get the lights to turn on there.

I flew towards ZZZ at 2;000 feet; stayed clear of Class B airspace for as long as possible; and was closely watching for traffic visually and on my iPad with the ADS-B in device I had connected. After flying above ZZZ4 and seeing the airport was dark I continued flying to ZZZ and concluded that it was my only option to land safely. Since I was low on fuel; when the airport was in sight; I began my descent into Runway XXR. During my approach I saw another aircraft taking off Runway XYL; I immediately turned left and landed on the parallel Runway XXL to stay clear of departing traffic. I taxied off the runway as fast as possible and worked with airport operations to safely secure my Cessna.This experience has taught me a lot of things to prevent [a situation] like this from happening in the future.

He continued to the transient parking area and called ZZZ Tower per their instructions.As the instructor; my student called me to inform me he had run off the runway; no damage had occurred; and he had spoken with the tower and FAA. I did not know he was flying by himself that day and had received no notification from him. I asked him to recount what happened to me several times trying to understand what happened. I called the Tower and confirmed that the winds were variable at 3 knots and visibility was very good. Based on his recount; I do not fully understand how he thought going off the runway was his safest option. I have not offered him any training or instruction that would indicate that was good judgment. He has never landed far off centerline with me in the plane and has never demonstrated that he would ever act in such a way. He and I have logged extensive dual hours at ZZZ doing pattern work; and he has never flown in a way that indicated he would act or make a decision in this manner. He had demonstrated consistently with me that he was able to maintain directional control of the airplane both in the air and on the ground. I have informed him that all of his solo endorsements are no longer valid. I was planning to spend an extensive amount of time with him on the ground and in the air addressing what happened yesterday through re-training; but he has decided to discontinue his flight training at this time. As a result of this incident; I have re-clarified to all students that they must inform me of any time they plan to solo and must receive my permission before doing so. I have also implemented a strict rule of no solo touch and goes. Solo pattern work will from now on only be full stop landings.",,"While doing solo touch/goes at ZZZ; on my second landing; I touched down just left of center. While rolling with the throttle in the idle position; I turned off the carb heat and began to retract the flaps. The nose of the plane began to veer right.

I felt it best; to reduce the chances of injury or damage. I applied just enough left rudder to straighten the nose movement and rolled onto the grass adjacent to the runway. No contact was made with any runway signage or lights. No damage to plane; runway or grass area and there were no injuries. Tower cleared for continued movement to the taxiway.

This caused him to get low and slow. I asked if he wanted to go around and he decided to continue. His focus was mainly on that and he failed to notice he was coming in crabbed to the right. I told him to use left rudder to straighten; which he did about 10 ft above the ground but at that point we were extremely left of center line and he panicked banked to the right; very hard; I told him to go around but he did not respond and we touched down completely side loaded and fairly hard. I took the controls and went around; but with all the flaps in it took a bit to get off the ground and the tail dragged on the runway. Once we got off the ground; I told the tower we were going around and that we were making this a full stop because we had a hard landing. [They] responded by telling us to set up for a left downwind for Runway XX1; and that we were cleared to land. In the meantime I did hear the tower send maintenance to inspect the runway; and they found no damage. This landing was fine and we taxied back and had maintenance (Name) inspect the tail.

Traffic was light until I got to a few miles from the airport. I initially was planning to cross midfield to enter downwind for Runway XX as the wind was out of the south at ten to fifteen knots on the surface. But an aircraft called in from the southeast and was going to enter the downwind at a forty-five-degree angle. When I was about ready to cross midfield; the aircraft called entering downwind. I continued on the upwind leg and then announced I would enter crosswind for Runway XX. An aircraft having taken off about a minute earlier and I had that plane in sight climbing out on the departure leg. As I entered crosswind; another plane departed intending to stay in the pattern. I was at cruise speed of 85 knots but with a twenty to twenty-five knot headwind at a thousand; I was only doing a ground speed of 60 to 65 knots.A pilot called me and asked if I had him in sight. I believing it was the aircraft having departed earlier said I did. The other pilot in the cockpit with me had pointed at the plane and I said to the pilot with me to keep track of the plane.I began to rock my wings for several seconds to help the last plane to depart to see me on the crosswind leg I was still on. I was then asked to turn out to the right while on crosswind. I did as requested; continued to look for traffic.A few seconds later; I saw a Piper Arrow pass me on my left within a few hundred feet of me at the same altitude having come up from behind me. I was then given a lecture on the CTAF that entering on crosswind was a very dangerous thing to do by the pilot who was clearly a flight instructor with a student to make a point. I decided not to bother to get into a shouting match as flying the airplane; both mine and the other pilot's plane was more important.What was wrong with what happened? First; the plane who I had a conflict with saw me on crosswind and did not give way to me as I was clearly on the right. All he had to do was have his student do was to alter course a little to the right to pass me as required by FAR. Second; an over taking aircraft by FAR is to pass to the right and well clear of slower aircraft. Finally; by allowing his student to come so close to me was operating in a careless manner.Based upon the amount of flight training conducted by the large university flight school; they need to have a control tower; to avoid potential mid air collisions. Until then; even though I have stopped there many times; I will avoid this airport.",,,,"GA pilot reported an NMAC while entering the traffic pattern at a non-towered airport.

The flight plan was to do air work in the area NNE of ZZZ bounded roughly by ZZZ1 and ZZZ2. After climbing to approximately 2200 feet MSL we practiced turns; dutch rolls and coordination exercises for about 25 minutes at 2200+/-100 MSL and groundspeed between 80 and 100 MPH per ADS-B tracking. At this time ZZZ2 winds were 6 MPH; Temp 69F and Dewpoint 58F for RH 68%. Engine RPMs were approximately 2200; consistent with these speeds and level flight. No engine roughness or loss of power was observed. Airspeed and altitude were maintained without noticeable changes in throttle or retrimming/loss of airspeed. About [30 minutes in to flight] we were near the dragstrip on a roughly NW heading and decided to climb to 3000 ft. When the throttle was advanced power was substantially or totally lost. Power loss occurred when the throttle was advanced; not prior to or after throttle advance and a power loss; not merely a failure to increase was observed. No sputtering; backfiring; roughness; surging or any engine change except a loss of power was observed.The aircraft had an annual signed off the day before and as part of that annual the throttle linkage end link had been upgraded from a ball and socket style to a rod end style per Cessna SE79-6. The throttle seemed to be disconnected with no response over the full range from idle to full. This motion was repeated several times to confirm. The failure to respond led me to conclude the throttle had failed in some way associated with the maintenance and I began a descent at about 65 MPH and 600 FPM and turned N toward the dragstrip. At this point I began the engine out checklist with fuel (tank; mixture and CH (carb heat)) and then checked the mags. These checks had no noticeable effect. The engine seemed to be operating at either idle; very low power or windmilling. Based on the fact that it stopped on roll out I believe that it was windmilling at this time.At this point we were at approx. 1;500 feet MSL/1;300 feet AGL and I decided that the field was preferable to the dragstrip being less obstructed and we began a 180 turn to reach the field. At the end of this turn we were at about 500 ft. and well above standard glidepath and began slipping to reach the field and not overrun it. During this turn we contacted ZZZ Tower; which was the last frequency set in our comm radio; though we were well outside their airspace. At no point during this descent and turn did the engine make any noises indicating an attempt/willingness to restart. After the first diagnostic attempt and after choosing the field as target no more attempts to troubleshoot or restart were made. The engine continued to windmill and the prop was never stopped.We touched down approximately ½ way through the field and rolled out without hard braking. The engine was dead on rollout. We attempted to contact ZZZ when on the ground and were unable and then managed to make a weak connection on 121.5 to an aircraft and requested relay of message but didn't hear if this actually got through. Then managed to google ZZZ Tower telephone and made cell call. Soon after the authorities arrived and we made provisions to secure the aircraft. Before leaving that night I tested for fuel flow at the gascolator in the as-landed state and got fuel flow.The following day the engine controls (throttle; mix; CH) were determined to be operational. Fuel flowed to gascolator. The aircraft left ZZZ with 9.5 and 10 Gals (L/R) and on the ground had 7.25 and 9.5. These measurements are based on a calibrated stick and approximate. Tanks were sumped and no water observed; fuel blue. The aircraft had been fueled in the morning and flown 1.3 hours before this flight; on both tanks. This flight had a Hobbs duration 0.8. The first 30-35 mins were run on left tank; the last several minutes before the failure on the right tank. Fuel flow was observed to gascolator from both tanks. Gascolator screen appeared clean. Oil level 3 3/8 qts. No damage or evidence of bird strike or obstruction on aircleaner. The engine was then started; warmed up and run up with no issues. Static run up was ok.[Later] the aircraft was inspected by an A&P/IA and these checks were repeated. Compression was observed on all cylinders; the magnetos were checked and the gascolator screen; carb inlet screen were checked and cleaned with no obstructions found. The carb bowl was drained and flushed. Fuel flow from both tanks to the bowl was confirmed. The carb inlet was checked and boroscoped with no problems found. The engine was again started and run up; passing all tests. Having eliminated all mechanical possibilities; the aircraft was signed off and was flown out of the field and back to ZZZ.I believe we were operating at all times within the POH and standard practice; at least as I was instructed. My instruction was CH on descent and when RPM <2;000; and when icing is observed. The Cessna 140 POH lists 2;100 RPM as a cruise setting and does not call for CH during cruise. We flew extensively prior to losing power at constant altitude and generally constant airspeed (discounting variations due to maneuvering). This profile in this airplane requires about 2;200 RPM and this is where we were operating for the 20+ minutes prior to losing power. The Cessna 140 POH is not very detailed; but the Cessna 150 has essentially the same engine (O-200 vs C-85) and its POH has similar guidance. It does not call for CH for cruise flight unless symptoms noted and cruise flight is listed as 2;000-2;750 RPM (which corresponds to the green tach arc). The FAA knowledge test and PHAK identify below 70F and high humidity (80%) thus we were operating (68F and 70%) just inside or on the boundary. Conditions at altitude would be more conducive to carb icing of course. Flying in the northeast one rarely flies outside the 'icing' zone on the standard temp/dewpoint chart.However; the only conclusion is that we did encounter carb icing with no symptoms. We did not notice any engine roughness prior to loss of power; nor does the flight path indicate a loss of power through either descent or loss of airspeed that was not detected in the cockpit. Given that we did have carb icing; had we detected symptoms and followed the Cessna 150 POH guidance 'to clear the ice' we would have 'applied full throttle and pulled the CH knob fully out'. This is what we inadvertently did when we opened the throttle to climb. This killed the engine. Had we then immediately applied CH it is possible that sufficient heat existed to clear the problem; however the C-85 has straight exhaust pipes and low thermal mass. The time delay between the failure required to establish glide; find a preliminary landing spot and confirm that there was in fact a problem was probably 15 seconds; during which the exhaust may have cooled sufficiently that no carb heat was available and no recovery of power possible. The checklist checks were performed quickly; but given that an acceptable landing spot had been identified I believe the proper course of action was to cease attempts to fix the issue and focus on a successful landing.",,,,"C140 pilot reported the engine lost power while applying full throttle for a climb and could not be restarted. Pilot conducted a safe off-airport landing. Post-flight; it was determined that carburetor ice was the likely cause of power loss.",

I went in the morning to try to beat a cold front that was coming over the mountains from the west. There was a cloud layer at 9000 ft. and about 15000 ft. that were both relatively stable and allowing for easy VFR flight around the ZZZ1 area. While practicing approximately 10 to the west-northwest of ZZZ1; I started encountering an impressive downdraft that required full power and a pitch attitude to Vx to maintain altitude. I flew east; further from the mountains; and got in some stable air when I noticed my ground speed heading north and south were drastically different. I was being blown north and couldn't keep the maneuvers within a certain area. I started having sudden altitude changes and was subject to the wind's power.I pointed my nose [to] the south to head into the wind and maintain stable flight. This is when I started climbing at extreme rates and blew through 10000 ft. I attempted to lower my attitude and get back into a descent; which slowed my climb rate but didn't get me out of a climbing rate. I worked to maintain a level flight attitude and positive control while being lifted through 11;12;13 and reaching 14 thousand ft. Without oxygen or ADS-B at this altitude I was worried of the possibility of interfering with ATC operations and hypoxia.Once at 14000 ft.; the updrafts calmed and the extreme rate of climb slowed. This is when I decided to turn back to ZZZ1 and get down if I could. I turned back north and still experienced some lift factor; though not as bad. Once over the airport I was able to pull power and conduct a descent back down and land safely. However; knowing I violated Part 91.225 stuck with me and wondering if I caused ATC any grief; I decided to file this. I believe I was riding the front of the cold front that scooped me far beyond my aircraft's service ceiling; 10000 ft. I think this was caused by flight closer to the mountains with a strong front coming through. I learned the true power of frontal systems and know that trying to squeeze a flight right before they bring weather through the area may not be the ideal time to train - also; having the Stratux onboard for ADS-B Out capabilities in case of special situations like that.

I was on the crosswind section of the pattern and decided to stay in the pattern with minimal power and land as soon as safely possible to investigate the issue. After landing I turned the engine off. It would not start. I called my CFI and told him that I was broken down in ZZZ. I then called the flight club and told them that I was also broke down in ZZZ. Upon preflight inspection I could not feel the alternator belt and reported this to the safety officer at the club. They messaged that they were sending someone to get me. An hour passed and then they said they were sending a plane with recovery pilot to me. Finally after 3 hours they said that they (Safety; Chief Pilot instructor; my CFI and Maintenance) had discussed it and it was fine for me to fly the plane back under VFR rules. The planes battery was charged. I started the plane and sent a message that I was leaving ZZZ and for someone to please watch FlightAware and text me if there was an issue.My CFI instructed me in challenges of no flaps landings; how to avoid getting lost and what to do if that happens; we discussed flight altitudes and best ways to spot potential places to set the plane down if an emergency did arise. I was instructed to reserve battery power for emergency radio communications and squawks. I have flown Aircraft X for appr. 70 hours and I was confident in her ability to make the trip.

There were three aircraft on final for Runway XX - a Tomahawk; C172; and PA-44; respectively. We had all three aircraft in sight and displayed on our TCAS. As we waited for the first two airplanes to land; we noted the time and distance it took for each aircraft to cross the runway threshold. Based on this information; we estimated the third aircraft's (PA-44) distance from the runway would allow us make a normal takeoff without causing any hazard to us or the approaching aircraft. To confirm our assumption; we asked the PA-44 for their approach speed. They responded; '100 kts.' Based on their speed; distance displayed on TCAS; and distance perceived to our eyes; my Student and I both agreed that we had enough space to make a safe takeoff. As the C172 touched down; I announced on the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) that we would 'line up and wait on Runway XX for the C172 to clear the runway.' We planned to start our takeoff roll as soon as the C172 exited the runway. As we taxied onto the runway; we noted the PA-44's distance still sufficient to make a safe takeoff. The time to cross the runway hold short line and the runway's centerline took less than 10 seconds. The C172 exited the runway about the same time that we lined up on the runway. Without delay; my Student commenced our takeoff roll. Upon reaching our rotation speed (65 kts.); we heard the PA-44 announce their go-around. We monitored the PA-44's location while we climbed upwind. As we climbed and crossed the runway's departure threshold; I noted the PA-44 slightly to the right and crossing the runway's approach threshold - a distance of about 5;264 ft.; or just under one mile between us. As we climbed upwind; the distance between our position and the PA-44 was decreasing. When we turned crosswind to remain in the pattern; the PA-44 also turned crosswind; placing them directly behind our position. As we continued to climb to pattern altitude (1;800 ft.); our TCAS display showed the PA-44 already at pattern altitude; behind us; and closing in on our position. I keyed the microphone and requested the PA-44's intention to remain or exit the pattern. The PA-44 did not respond. When the TCAS display showed the PA-44 almost directly above us and at a difference of 300 ft. in altitude; my Student and I elected to level off and exit the pattern at/around 1400 ft. to the southeast.

I turned off unnecessary lights to see if that would help and it did momentarily but the issue continued shortly thereafter. Before taking off; we fueled the aircraft to maximum capacity which gives us about 4 and a half hours of flight time. At this point we were about 30 minutes into the flight when I realized my fuel gauges showing that I had a lot less fuel than I knew I should have at this portion of the light. I kept an eye on that but suggested we turn back and conclude our flight. At this point I tried making calls to ZZZ Tower to let them know we intend to return and make a full stop but was not getting anything back from them. I got the weather by tuning into the ASOS frequency which was hard to do because the radios were intermittent and frequencies took a while to change. 10 minutes had elapsed through this and by now one fuel gauge was pointing at (E) and the other at about a quarter tank left. I checked to see if there was a fuel leak by any chance but there wasn't and I had checked the fuel caps before taking off after filling up the aircraft. I knew we had fuel in the tanks but this was still an uneasy feeling. I stayed calm and proceeded towards ZZZ while continuing trying to contact them. We were about 6 miles away from the airport when I realized there was a popped circuit breaker and it was the alternators. I then immediately went through my checklist for this type of event and brushed up on procedures. Once I could see what runways were in use and was about 500 feet above the traffic pattern rocked my wings to advice of my situation and could faintly hear the Tower communicating to aircraft in the pattern about my situation and clearing them so we could land. I had to land without flaps but did so safely and cleared the active runway immediately after and parked the airplane on the first ramp next to the taxiway.

I told the PA24 to keep an eye out for the other aircraft as they departed but that the other aircraft did have them in sight and to contact departure. A few minutes later the C150 said they 'lost the other aircraft and asked where he was'. At that point I issued traffic again and the PA24 was passing off their right side at less than 1/2 mi. In hindsight; I could have asked the Cessna again if they *still* had the airplane in sight that they said they had in sight when they were two miles apart. I also could have kept both aircraft until they passed and turned the departure or turned the arrival which all seemed unnecessary at the time because the arrival said they had the other aircraft in sight. I guess the moral of the story for me is don't trust pilots and ensure that they're doing what they say they're ding.",,"GA pilot and local controller reported an NMAC occurred when the pilot lost sight of another aircraft while maneuvering in the traffic pattern at night.",

After viewing carb icing chart and discussing with A&P mechanics it was determined atmospheric conditions were 90-100% relative humidity and likely caused severe carb icing. Proximity to water and dam spillways may have introduced additional moisture into the air. Coupled with poor carb heat performance known on O-200 engines; carb ice likely took a long time to melt.

I stopped to refuel at ZZZ2. I ran to the restroom; topped off the plane; preflighted including sumping fuel; picked alternates; and checked weather. Reported winds along my route varied from 170 - 190 at 33 - 37. My planned route was between a heading of 175 - 185. Per the POH; my TAS is 119 MPH; fuel burn at 2500 MSL is 6 gal/hr; and fuel burn at 5000 MSL is 5.5 gal/hr. Climb fuel burn 0 to 5000 is 1.6 gal. including start and run-up. Total usable fuel is 22.5. For my flight plan I rounded up to a 40 kt. direct headwind. I rounded down for 110 MPH airspeed; giving me 70 MPH ground speed. My cruise time came to be 2.1 with an estimated 0.2 climb; total flight time of 2.3 hours.For planned fuel: 22.5 -- 1.6 (climb) -- 12.6 (cruise at 6 gal/hr) --  4.5 (45-minute fuel reserve) = 3.8 gal (0.6 hours) extra fuel. Totaling 3.6 hours of fuel.During the flight I checked for updated winds throughout my route which all showed no change. I continued to recalculate my ETA throughout the flight; which all came out to landing before I entered my 45-minute reserve. My last calculation was performed 10 miles from the field. I showed that I would land with 0.6 hours fuel reserve left over. I checked the charts for other fields but was between 20 - 30 miles from those fields; and made the decision to continue as I wouldn't reach those airports before I was critically low on fuel. My fuel gauges showed I had approximately 4 - 5 gallons remaining. After making 2-way radio contact with ZZZ Tower; I began my descent into the field. I was cleared to land [Runway] XXL at approximately 5 miles out and shortly after; my engine coughed and sputtered. I was approximately 1100 AGL when this happened. I immediately called Tower as I pitched for best glide and took a survey for landing. I had [a] black area under me and a road about 1 mile to my right. I turned for the road as my engine cut out. I realized it was a fuel problem based on the sound of the shutdown sounding the same as an idle cutoff shutdown. I then performed the following: checked fuel is on; checked mixture rich; carb heat on; [and] tried restarting while pulling primer to try pumping extra fuel into cylinders. When this did not work; I continued announcing to Tower and ran the shutdown checklist: mixture idle cutoff; fuel off; mags off; verified all lights on; and prepped for landing. I cleared a tree and power line about 100 ft. above; lined up with the road; held best glide; watched a power line go 10 ft. over my head; had a vehicle stop behind me; landed on the road without hitting the road signs or light poles; and once stopped I had a small vehicle drive under my wing and another 2 stop in front of me. All with no damage to the aircraft. Not a single scratch. Once on the ground I called Tower to let them know I was not harmed; no damage and I was getting out to move the plane. I got the plane off the road and let Tower know I was out of the road and shutting the plane down. I inspected for damage; checked on the people in the vehicles; while they came to check on me and called my family. When officers arrived on scene I gave them my information and answered all questions. I called the safety team for the airport to discuss how to get the plane on the field. We put the plane on a tow truck and moved it to the airport. Once unloaded; I secured the plane; checked the Hobbs time; reinspected for damage; called the club manager again to inform him of the updated situation; and went home. The total flight time was 3.0. When returning to the plane; I checked fuel levels and sumped before topping off to see if there was a problem. The caps were tightened properly. No particles or water in the sumped fuel and the stick confirmed all fuel was burned off. What contributed to the event: the winds aloft were much higher than listed and my fuel burn per hour was higher than what was stated in the POH. Additional actions taken to prevent this reoccurring: ensuring full tanks before every flight [and] planning fuel stops every 1.5 to 2.0 hours.",,,,"Small aircraft pilot reported performing an off airport landing due to fuel exhaustion after experiencing greater than anticipated fuel burn in flight.",

Unlimited visibility. Was in cruise at 7;500 feet and engine began to lose RPM. I tried manipulating mixture lever; throttle; checked fuel selector; carb heat. Nothing helped. I wasn't able to maintain altitude on reduced power; nor was I able to 'fix' the issue; so I [requested priority handling] with ATC (I was on VFR flight following); and with not many open fields around; nor knowing how the engine would perform as time passed; I opted to follow the road until I could assure gliding distance to ZZZ. Engine performed better at lower altitudes and momentarily with selection of carb heat. Landed at ZZZ with engine power.I have not flown this 150 much so I called another pilot who flies it often. He said this plane doesn't like the higher altitudes ('that's airline pilot height' :o) and perhaps the mixture creeped higher because it's not the type with a lock. Who knows? Oil pressure and temperature were good; and visual engine inspection didn't reveal any issues. Oil quantity was within range. We had three hours of fuel onboard.Since the engine performed well at lower altitudes and a subsequent engine run up (done on the ground) showed no negative indications; I decided the loss of RPM must have been caused by the mixture being set (or creeping up) to too rich in cruise. I took a 30-minute decompression break and decided to continue to our destination at a lower (non-airline pilot) altitude.I would have liked for this engine to not have been temperamental; but given the circumstances; I believe I chose the safest course of action.  Perhaps the one thing I could have done was check the mixture lean a second time; or multiple times; after setting it initially in cruise. Or chosen a lower altitude.

After practicing maneuvers nearby; I flew back to ZZZ for landing Runway XX. On downwind; I noticed an experimental aircraft holding short for Runway XX. I turned base and made appropriate radio calls. At this time the pilot of the experimental aircraft announced he was departing XX. I then turned final; made appropriate radio calls and stated I would go around if needed due to the aircraft still positioned on the end of the runway. At this point the aircraft began taking off; not responding to my radio call; and I used my best judgment to determine whether to go around. I was at a low altitude with full flaps; and I thought a go around while veering right could be dangerous due to buildings and terrain right of the runway. I believed the best course of action was to land after the aircraft had taken off or go around following the heading of the runway. I didn't feel comfortable going around over the runway; in fear that the departing aircraft could liftoff too close to my position. As I approached the beginning of the runway; the departing aircraft was still on the ground; and I figured out later he had aborted takeoff. He made no radio calls communicating this with me. In the moment; I determined it was safest to land at the beginning of the runway; stopping as soon as possible. I felt like this was safer than going around and risking a mid air collision. At the time I touched down; the other aircraft was approximately 3;000 ft down the runway from me.

I leveled/descended to 2500 ft. and between 30 seconds to 1 minute later the aircraft passed directly over me. ADS-B said 300 ft. above. My ADS-B did not register the conflict until after the controller had informed me to level off. I appreciate the controllers awareness and timely call. As the aircraft being overtaken; I have the right of way; but also the responsibility to avoid other aircraft. In a VFR situation; I will now be making a slight course alteration on straight-out departures to prevent flying an exactly straight out departure as my C150 will almost always be the slower aircraft and others will likely fly the straight out heading. I am unsure if the other aircraft knew where I was; or truly saw me on departure. They were not on flight following and later in the flight flew through an active restricted area.

As a new instructor; I came in to help fill time for another instructor & ended up taking this student in; as they only booked me from then on. I've flown with this student before in another type Cessna-172; and our landings were being worked on in that plane. As I was coming in to land for this landing; we had runway secured and student noticed they were drifting left of centerline. We knew winds were variable because some weather was soon to be in the area; but winds were very light still. I told student 'right rudder... right rudder' and input more also; as well as trying to make corrective actions with ailerons; and we kept drifting left; so I initiated a go around. We were at full flaps- 40deg; and just about to pull idle because runway was secure; and as I took controls and put full power; we just sank even more to the ground and at that point; hit the ground (which I wasn't aware of at the time because the plane was now not responding to my input controls). Unable to climb or gain airspeed. I then pulled full idle after realizing we were not going to get off the ground; and we landed; stayed on runway; and exited right away. Was able to taxi back to ramp for inspection. There were many factors that day; and the plane we were in was not powerful at all; 100HP; so I think trying to save the landing by doing a go around; made it worse; instead of landing off centerline. Everything was going right; until it wasn't. We tried to save the landing; and because a C150 is not powerful; a go around isn't always the answer; like they say. Going forward: Maybe in certain horsepower planes; making a go around be at a certain altitude and flap setting; no lower or less; could have helped. I would have tried to land and been way off centerline; rather than trying for the go around and not gaining airspeed or altitude fast enough. I saw glimpses of good days with this student; but it wasn't consistent. We were trying to work with them & get them a license; but they weren't understanding the basics- like needing right rudder for takeoff and landing- even at 100 hours & being told every flight they need right rudder. I spent maybe 7 of those hours with them; but was supposed to be co-working with another instructor to help them achieve their goals. Never having been in a situation like that- low power plane & off centerline that much; and as a new instructor; I learned lots of valuable lessons that day that I will carry with me for the rest of my training days.",,,,"Cessna 150 Flight Instructor reported a minor tail strike on landing on a training flight with a student after student failed to apply proper rudder inputs.",

I do recall that most of the taxiways were closed and under repair/construction. Owner flew the pattern then asked me to take it on short final. We were high and fast so I slipped to lose altitude and held nose up to reduce airspeed. I intended a wheel landing then touch and go. I bounced a bit on the touch down and was blown off to the left by a right crosswind and went off the runway into the dirt and dirt clods and saw construction cones in front of me.

We were conducting multiple landings and takeoffs of different types. On the landing prior to the near miss we had done a landing to a full stop and then we taxied back to Runway XX threshold. During the taxi a Cessna 172 landed and appeared to takeoff (touch and go) since we never saw the plane again. Once we got to the hold short line for Runway XX we announced on radio that we were taking off and staying in the pattern.Reports were made by us (meaning Pilot Flying; since I did not have a push to talk). When on downwind; I mentioned to the Pilot Flying that we have not heard that other plane on the radio and thought that they must have left the area. I told Pilot Flying to conduct a short field landing on this approach. During the turn from base to final; the Pilot Flying announced on the radio 'turning final for XX'. A second or two later a voice came over the radio saying 'look below you'. When I heard this I looked down from the right side window; puzzled by who was talking on the radio. The Pilot Flying then told me he could see a plane low but on his side. The Cessna came into my view at that time since we were in a descent. I grabbed the yoke and turned the plane to the right and told Pilot Flying to continue away from the Cessna. The Cessna 172 then did a go around and turned away to the left; and pilot on radio said he was leaving the area and that he wanted our tail number (note that the voice of the pilot of the Cessna 172 was the same voice that said 'look below you'. His radio transmission was clear and readable. We circled around and landed without any further incident with the Cessna 172. After putting the plane in the hangar we went the pilot lounge at the airport and came in contact with the Airport Manager; who has a radio on that is tuned to the local airport CTAF frequency. I asked him if he had heard us on the radio; he said yes. I asked if had heard the other aircraft on the radio he said no. I can't speak to what the pilot (Cessna 172) was doing on final or where he had came from; since no radio transmissions were heard by me or the Pilot Flying. I do know that this airport is frequented by student pilots/instructors for traffic pattern work.",,"On Day 0; my instructor and I were conducting my BFR (Biennial Flight Review) in my Cessna 150. We were performing practice exercises; which included some takeoffs and landings on Runway XX at ZZZ. On a previous landing prior to the near miss; we completed a full stop landing and then taxied back to Runway XX. During taxi; a Cessna 172 landed and then did a takeoff. After its takeoff we did not know the whereabouts of the Cessna 172. When we got to the hold short line of Runway XX; I announced a takeoff and reported remaining in the pattern. Announcements were made at crosswind and the downwind segments. During the downwind segment; my instructor mentioned and concluded that the Cessna 172 had most likely left the area. There were no other incoming aircraft announcements or any other aircraft in sight. It was then decided; it would be safe to complete a short field landing on Runway XX. I then announced and turned the base leg; and afterwards; announced the turn to final for Runway XX. A couple of seconds later; a voice came over the radio saying; 'Look below you'. When we heard this; my instructor and I immediately looked down not knowing where this radio transmission came from. I spotted a Cessna 172 below us and off to my left. We immediately turned to the right; away from the Cessna 172. The Cessna 172 never landed; but executed a climbing left turn. We then heard another announcement regarding the intention to depart the area. Note that the departure announcement voice was the same voice that announced; 'Look below you'. These transmissions were clear and readable. We circled back and landed on XX without any further incident with the Cessna 172. We never saw the Cessna 172 again. After returning my plane to the hanger at ZZZ; we went to the pilots' lounge where we came in contact with the airport's FBO assistant. The FBO assistant has a radio tuned to the local CTAF frequency. There was also another gentleman present. We asked them if they had heard our radio announcements. They both replied; 'Yes'. We asked if they heard other aircraft announcing intentions to land at that time. They both replied; 'No'. We were unable to determine the origin or the flight path of the Cessna 172; which we spotted on final; or where it had come from. It may or may not have been the same Cessna 172 that we saw taking off earlier. It is possible that it was a different Cessna 172 not making radio announcements; for whatever reason; with the intention to land at ZZZ. There is a GPS approach on [Runway] XX at ZZZ. It is possible that it was an aircraft on a practice approach failing to make position announcements. This could easily explain the flight path of the Cessna 172; and the reason it was below us and to the left.",,"Flight Instructor and pilot reported a NMAC at a non-towered airport.

Shortly thereafter ZZZ Tower advised we were low altitude. following the advisory they told us that they saw smoke coming from the plane. We immediately made a left turn and they cleared us to land [Runway] XXL which was the opposite runway at the time. We inspected the plane after and there were no visual cues of smoke or engine problems however the plane is going back to Maintenance to be looked at.",,"I was flying as a student pilot with my CFI as the Pilot in Command. The plane is a personally owned 1966 Cessna 150F. It should be noted the plane had been with the mechanic for the week previous at which time a Garmin 430 was installed; front landing strut serviced; and full engine cleaning took place. This flight was the first flight after receiving the plane back from the mechanic.Prior to the flight the engine was turned on and idling at approximately 1000 RPM for approximately 15 minutes as my CFI instructed me on how to use the newly installed Garmin 430 system. After the ground instruction; a runup was conducted during which time no adverse items were noted. The total time on ground with engine running was approximately 25 minutes with all instruments reporting in the green.After our runup we were provided clearance for takeoff on Runway XR with a short delay approved. A short field takeoff maneuver was conducted to practice for upcoming checkride. During the climb I noticed unusually low climb rate at approximately 150 fpm. All engine indicators including oil temperature; oil pressure and RPM were normal however the plane was not climbing normally. Approximately 45 seconds after takeoff; Tower advised our altitude was low and asked if everything was ok with the airplane. Again checking all instruments no problem was detected which we indicated to the Tower. At this point the Tower advised they observed apparent smoke coming from our airplane and asked if we would like to return for landing.No smoke was observed by either myself or the CFI; our engine temperature gauge was showing normal; our oil pressure gauge was showing normal; and we had not loss any RPMs from our engine. However; hearing the warning of smoke from our airplane from Tower we advised we would like to return for landing. At this point the CFI took over controls of the airplane and Tower cleared us to land on [Runway] XXL. Additionally emergency service vehicles were activated as a precautionary measure. While the CFI was flying the airplane to land; I continually monitored the instruments and outside window for smoke. At no point did I observe any smoke nor did the instruments indicate anything outside of the normal range.Once landing on the [Runway] XXL we taxied to our assigned parking spot during which time again all instruments remained in the green. Upon parking; the fire department remained on scene as my CFI and myself observed the engine compartment and observed no smoke; no smell of fire or smoke; and located no evidence of a fire from the airplane.

Advised Tower that I was to taxi back and depart using the ZZZZZ departure.  Tower directed me to taxi via Taxiway 2 to the departure end of Runway XX and to stay on Tower frequency.  As I taxied abeam the FBO the school aircraft departed the ramp area on to the taxiway feet in front of me.  Immediate and aggressive braking was required to not make contact.  As the Cessna 140 is a tailwheel the tail rose and the prop struck the ground.  The engine stopped.  I shutdown the aircraft and assessed the other crew's physical status.  The Instructor Pilot said that he was cleared to taxi but delayed after the clearance and did not advise Ground.  I had no idea that the aircraft was cleared to taxi as I was on Tower frequency.  I did not receive an advisory to look for traffic from the ramp.  As I came to a stop I noticed that the IP (Instructor Pilot) was not looking my direction.  He came to me and admitted that he was cleared to taxi but failed to heed the clearance in suitable time.  He also 'did not see me until the student pulled out'.  Occurrence cause:  failure of the incurring aircraft from the ramp to the active taxiway to give way to my aircraft established and cleared on the taxiway.  Contributing factors: 1. Tower kept me on Tower frequency decreasing my situational awareness of the taxi environment; 2. Instructor Pilot distraction from the situation; 3.

The plane is kept outside under cover. I arrived at the field around XG:30 AM. I deiced the frost from the wings; and did my pre-flight. There was a small amount of water in the fuel but I was able to sump until no more water showed up. The plane started up easily but was running slightly rough. It has been behaving like this for the past month or two. The owner has replaced both magnetos within the past month with an electronic magneto system.We took off around XH:30. After completing slow flight and several chandelles; we leveled out at 5000 ft. Suddenly; the engine began to fluctuate RPMs from 2400 down to 1000 and back up several times. Then the engine completely cut out. We were unable to restart and out of gliding distance to the nearest airports. We chose to land the plane in a cleared field. After several hours; the FAA released the plane and the owner was able to start it up in the field. He reported that it ran a little rough. To my knowledge; no determination on the cause of the engine failure has been determined. The owner is replacing the carburetor. Water in the fuel may have been a contributing factor especially because Cessna 150's are known for this issue. The new magnetos may also be suspect. My CFI and I worked well together to plan out our descent and choose a safe landing spot.",,"Lost engine power while in cruise flight to a practice airport with less traffic. The day's plan of action for my commercial student in her flying club airplane was to practice  procedures; specifically steep spirals to landing. As an instructor; I've flown this model of aircraft for a few hundred hours. I practiced or taught more than 30 engine out landings in the past few months in this aircraft. Recently the weather had changed from mild temperatures to cold temps being in the twenties at night; so the aircraft would seem to start much differently than in the warmer temperatures. In the warmer temperatures the airplane would start and quickly be able to maintain 1000 RPM; but when it was cold outside the airplane would cut off if you tried to bring it back to 1000 RPM for idle after starting. This was one possible warning flag that we missed and which was attributed to the cold temps.Another warning flag was on a previous flight happened a few weeks earlier. This happened with another student. The aircraft had a much different type of engine surge; which I'll describe as mild; with only a 100 RPM drop. This lasted a few minutes while over an airport and then returned to normal. Fuel samples from the before the flight had a few drops of water. I witnessed and double checked to make sure no more water was coming from either tank. The fuel is also a mixture of auto fuel and 100LL. This aircraft has a STC for auto fuel and is used to keep the cost down for the club. That first time the aircraft surged I attributed it to possibly water contamination. I reported this to the AP and the club replaced the spark plugs. I ran the airplane again the it didn't sound or feel right; so I reported it again to the AP and he replaced one magneto after it failed the mag check. After replacing the magneto the airplane still didn't sound like a perfect; but passed all checks on the ground. The airplane just felt different than in the summer. While flying at roughly 4200AGL I noticed the engine was surging from 2400 RPM to 1000 RPM and each time the RPMs would surge the range was getting larger. For example the first time it was from 2400 to 1000; then 2400 to 900; 2200 to 700 and it lasted about 40 seconds until the engine died. The oil pressure and engine temps were in the green. The airplane was full of fuel and in the on position. After the engine quit; I told my commercial student to fly the airplane at best glide and point it to the airport while I ran the checklist. After running the checklist; the airplane still wouldn't start. At the completion of the checklist; I [requested priority on frequency] and we squawked XXXX. After [requesting priority] twice within roughly 30 seconds; a controller got on the frequency and gave a us a discrete frequency. His voice was hard to hear because someone else was stepping on him while trying to relay information. The controller assured us that he knew where we were and that he'd send services after touchdown. My commercial student identified a field that look suitable to land. My student maneuvered the aircraft in a position where we could better identify any possible hazards in our intended landing area. Once we were close to 2000 AGL; I asked if my student was comfortable with me taking the landing and agreed to allow me to take the off airport landing. At 1000 AGL; I took the controls. As I got the airplane on a downwind I noticed power lines running across the field we were going to land on; so than I quickly maneuvered the airplane to an adjacent field. Once in position similar to a high final approach; I slipped the airplane and put full 40 degrees of flaps to slow down our ground speed and use as much of the available 2300 foot long field. The rows aligned with our make shift landing strip which help with not damaging the aircraft. The surface was a little more bumpy than landing in a traditional grass strip. The airplane didn't sustain any damage and we walked away from the aircraft and called ZZZ Approach with a number they provided us on a discrete frequency after landing. Approach gave us another number to call and we talked to someone who told us to call; so  they could better find us. We dropped a pin using an iPhone and provided our address. Operator didn't know what to think when we called; they asked how can they help us. We didn't really need any services since we were both okay and the airplane was not damaged. We were told that service were on the way and we said we are just fine. CRM really played a key role in allowing us to run the checklist; get services on stand-by and fly. Assigning duties and task made it easier to accomplish the goal at hand and that was to aviate; navigate and communicate. Understanding what my student was capable of performing allowed me to delegate.Still haven't heard what cause the airplane to stop running; but the FAA rep didn't find any water in the fuel or metal in the oil. The tanks were still three-quarters full. The FAA rep and the owner started the airplane; but it didn't sound great to either one of them. The AP/Owner stated that it was likely a carburetor with a stuck float. I know the aircraft has an auto fuel STC and it's possible the fuel was possible tainted with ethanol fuel that maybe caused the float to stick. This is only my theory; because the owner still hasn't take the carburetor off the airplane.",,"C150 instructor pilot and student reported an engine failure resulting in an off airport landing.",

We were conducting a practice ILS XX approach at ZZZ; on the DME arc to intercept the localizer. Just prior to intercept; the student reported that she had lost the CDI needle; and the navigation radio showed a message of 'glideslope receiver has failed.' Within 1 minute; the transponder stated that it; too; had failed; and our GPS was flickering. At this point; I determined that we were losing electrical power. Since weather was clear; we were only 30 minutes from base; and familiar with the local area and route; I elected to return home. We were still on frequency with ZZZ Center and I attempted to transmit our intentions and situation; however; there was insufficient power to do so. Within another minute; we had lost all electrical power except for the intercom. I have the ZZZ Approach telephone # saved in my phone and attempted to call using Bluetooth on my headset. I was able to get a hold of a controller and attempted to provide an update with our intentions. Due to either poor connection; background noise; and/or failing equipment; I do not believe the full message was received.Our return to base was uneventful and we made a no-flap landing. Upon reaching the hangar; I called ZZZ Approach and let them know we were safely on the ground. The controller informed me that they were tracking us as a primary target and were going to have search and rescue check on us if I had not called.We are still troubleshooting the cause of the failure. The EIS (GI 275) as installed only displays system amperage on the main screen; preventing early identification of an issue. The student did check the amperage during the engine run up; but this was a meaningless number as it is not tied to the alternator. Post-incident testing showed this number would increase with an increased load on the system and manually taking the alternator offline via the master switch would not change it. The only other electrical data available is the battery voltage; but this is only accessible by navigating to a secondary page and would not indicate a problem prior to departure. Alerts are not prominently displayed and are indicated by a flashing white icon in the upper left section of the device. This is the same way the unit displays a message or non-critical alert (e.g. expired database). Since this icon is almost always flashing; it is frequently ignored (alert fatigue). I discussed with the aircraft owner about changing the parameters displayed to show alternator voltage or a charge/discharge state; which would readily indicate the health of the electrical system. On the incident flight we did not discover there was a problem until it was too late and everything began to shut down. I have started carrying my handheld radio even if I do not have my full flight bag with me. This would have let me contact ATC and would permit us to fly a VOR or ILS/LOC approach if we experienced the same issue in actual IMC.",,,,"C150 flight instructor reported rapid electrical failure; without early detection; resulted in return to safe landing at home airport.",

I immediately asked my student if he heard the noise to which he replied that he was just about to ask me if I heard it too. At that point I simultaneously notified ZZZ Approach that we were returning to ZZZ; leveled off; reduced our power setting and ran the emergency checklist. The reduction in power seemed to stop the popping. The controller asked for souls on board and fuel remaining and if I wanted to [request priority handling] to which I responded no due to the fact that the popping had stopped and all gauges were green. I was quickly switched to ZZZ tower and Instructed to enter a left downwind to runaway XX. At this point I heard tower cancel the landing clearance of another aircraft.

I did not declare an emergency since the engine was still running and I had the field in sight with plenty of time and altitude. Made a safe landing with no damage to persons or property; informed ZZZ Center I was safely on the ground; and promptly contacted the owners. They were very nice and understanding and had no problems with the event. At the initial moment I had a reduction in power/engine roughness I believed it to be carb ice and pulled carb heat. The RPM's were fluctuating from about 1600 to 2500; not the typical slight loss of rpm and then rise a few seconds later after pulling carb heat. With fear of possible engine failure I felt it best to make a precautionary landing and have a mechanic check it out in case it was something besides carb ice. I regained power and engine smoothed out after turning downwind to base. The mechanic looked it over and said it was most likely carb ice. I am looking into having either a carb ice detector or carb temp gauge installed to be able to stay farther ahead of potential icing possibilities further in advance in the future.",,,,"A C150 pilot reported they experienced a rough running engine so diverted to a nearby private airport.",

I again made 2 more calls on CTAF just before and while crossing mid field. One aircraft was visible holding short of Runway XX. Another aircraft was on an RNAV approach to runway X and announced intentions to do a circling approach to runway XX. Communication was established with the faster aircraft circling for XX and was agreed that they would pass under at pattern altitude while I was crossing at 2400AGL so they could complete their approach and land. We both made call that we had each other in sight and there was no conflict. Meanwhile the aircraft holding short took runway XX and executed a take off with no radio calls. As I rolled wings level out of my teardrop into the pattern the departing aircraft had executed a hard left turn immediately after take off and came up from my left and cut in front of me approximately 75 to 100 feet off my flight path and climbing in to my flight path. I immediately executed evasive action descending and banking to the right. The other aircraft rolled out of turn and ended up above and behind me. I made radio calls for the other aircraft in the downwind to climb immediately with no response. I descended to approximately 500 AGL and after using ADSB to verify the other traffic was climbing slowly out of the pattern and I could maintain separation I executed a left base turn and climbed back to 2100 AGL and made calls for a mid field crossing and teardrop for runway XX. Two other aircraft that had been approaching the pattern gave me some extra spacing so I could land after listening to the event on CTAF.A short while later I looked up the other aircraft on ADSB and they had changed their squawk code to 7600 to indicate a radio failure.I am not sure what else I could have done to avoid this situation.

Cruise performance expected a 5.5 GPH fuel burn. In flight; ground speed indicated approximately 70 kts; which indicted a wind just slightly higher than expected. As the route progressed; the headwinds continue to increase far beyond that forecasted. As I entered my reserve fuel I became concerned while direct the IAF for my destination. My ground speed had dropped to just 35kts. I did a calculation and determined that would arrive with minimal usable fuel left; and decided to divert to ZZZ for fuel. The airport was close to my destination; but the extreme headwinds had pushed me beyond my comfort and I was almost right at the IAF for the RNAV XXR at ZZZ. I was cleared for the approach and switch to tower; I broke out well above minimums at about 1800 feet; and switched to land on XXL for convenience of where the FBOs were. On short final I was surprised by the engine sputtering and losing power. I was able to glide and land in the grass safety area; probably 100 feet short of the runway without damage. Flight time at that point was approximately 3:40 and should have still had 5-6 gallons left in the aircraft (2 usable). Clearly the aircraft had burned significantly more fuel per hour than expected.

I measured the field via ForeFlight and Google Maps to ensure I had enough distance for takeoff and checked my POH takeoff roll calculations. Takeoff was normal; I circled the field to gain altitude; then flew directly to ZZZ4 via the highway; then to ZZZ1. I obtained flight following. I asked for a Bravo clearance to maintain a higher altitude; however was denied. I did request to fly point to point and flew over ZZZ5's Airport; then into ZZZ1 Airport without incident.

I had carb heat on and all engine gauges were in the green. Suddenly the engine started to shake violently and I had a major reduction in power. I seemed to be limited to 1700 RPM until the shaking increased considerably. I was 3 miles north of ZZZ Airport and turned to it immediately and began circling overhead to prepare for a landing. I ran through my checklists and things that I thought might explain a rough running engine. Things such as checking if the primer was in and locked; which it was. Checking oil pressure and temperature; these gauges indicated in the green; telling me that the engine hadn't lost all oil. Verifying fuel gauges indicated there was fuel. I don't trust these gauges; I filled up both tanks fully before I took off and had flown for about an hour and a half. The plane hold 26 gallons with 23 usable. When I landed I checked the fuel and had 17 gallons left. As I was circling over the airport; I checked everything I had control over in the plane. I found that there was nothing I could do to save the engine in flight. I then advised the ZZZ frequency (XXX.X). I lost enough altitude to enter a left downwind for runway XX. I made a tight pattern to stay higher and faster until I was established on final. I then put the aircraft into a slip to lose that last bit of altitude and speed. I then made a smooth touchdown on runway XX. Because I had some power; I was able to exit the runway and taxi near parking; while keeping it off the grass in case of a fire.",,,,"Cessna 150 student pilot reported an engine malfunction while on a solo training flight practicing maneuvers.

The steps put in place from this point include me making sure that all available and relevant information directly related to aircraft and passenger safety will be; at minimum; double checked by another competent; appropriately licensed/rated pilot.

We descended to 4700 and again I said 'maintain altitude until we get 2 reds and 2 whites.'  At this time; he said 'I'm at full throttle.'  We were descending now at about 1000 rpms with throttle full and losing about 500 feet per minute.  At this point I took control and told my student; 'I think we are landing on the freeway.'  A few moments later and only about 100' off the ground I said to my student; 'We are landing on the freeway.'  I jockeyed the throttle a couple times and the engine sputtered.  Then I pushed the mixture to full rich and the engine sputtered back to life.  We slowly climbed away from the freeway and returned to ZZZ without further incident.  As I turned onto final approach to the freeway; I noticed traffic ahead about 1000 yards and traffic behind about 3/4 mile.  We were luckily positioned as to not harm anyone else.  After landing at ZZZ we inspected the inside of the engine cowl to find a wrench lodged.  A more thorough preflight by my student may have found the wrench.  It was difficult to see after the flight when I was inspecting with an intention to find something amiss.  The mixture was not changed from the run-up until about to touch down on the freeway.  It was set perfectly for field elevation where we took off and landed.  So; the only thing I can think to cause the problem was the wrench lodged against something disturbing the mixture or throttle.  I look forward to talking with the mechanic tomorrow to see what exactly the wrench was lodged against and if that was the problem.",,,,"Flight Instructor on a training flight with student reported an engine malfunction in flight.",
