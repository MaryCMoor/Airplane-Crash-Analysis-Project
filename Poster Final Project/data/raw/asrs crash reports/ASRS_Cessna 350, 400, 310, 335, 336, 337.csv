THE STUDENT NOTICED THE R BRAKE DIDN'T FEEL NORMAL; I APPLIED MY BRAKES; THEY WORKED AS THEY SHOULD. THE STUDENT AGAIN APPLIED HIS BRAKES; AT THIS TIME THEY APPLIED NORMALLY. TAXI WAS CONTINUED. STUDENT WAS TAXIING ACFT ON TXWY BRAVO. UPON APPLYING BRAKES THE STUDENT COMMUNICATED 'WE HAVE NO BRAKES.' AT THE SAME TIME THE ACFT SLOWLY BEGAN TO VEER L OF THE CTRLINE. I IMMEDIATELY APPLIED FULL R RUDDER AND FULL R BRAKE. THE ACFT DID NOT RESPOND TO THESE INPUTS IN ANY WAY. I THEN ATTEMPTED TO STOP THE ACFT BY APPLYING BOTH L AND R BRAKES; ALSO WITHOUT RESULT. NEITHER THE L OR THE R SIDE BRAKES OPERATED NORMALLY WHEN APPLIED AT THIS TIME. I THEN BROUGHT BOTH ENG MIXTURE CTLS TO THE IDLE CUTOFF POS. SOON AFTER; THE ACFT DEPARTED TXWY BRAVO L MAIN WHEEL FIRST. THE ACFT SEEMED TO PIVOT AROUND L MAIN WHEEL CAUSING THE NOSEWHEEL TO SHEAR OFF. THE NOSE CAME TO REST ON THE GND; AT WHICH TIME EACH ENG HAD ONE BLADE OF THE PROP IN THE GND. THE R ENG PROP SUSTAINED A BEND WHILE THE L ENG PROP DID NOT SUSTAIN ANY DAMAGE. ALL CORRECTIVE ACTION MADE BY ME HAD FAILED. THE FAA INVESTIGATOR I SPOKE WITH CHALLENGED MY DECISION OF BRINGING THE MIXTURES TO THE IDLE CUTOFF POS. HE SAID I SHOULD HAVE USED THE ASYMMETRIC THRUST. I TOLD HIM THAT AT THE TIME THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INEFFECTIVE; AND CONSIDERING I HAD NO BRAKES IT WOULD HAVE INCREASED MY SPD. TXWY WIDTH WAS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN MY DECISION PROCESS. BRAVO TXWY IS 40 FT WIDE; WHICH GAVE ME 20 FT TO USE. IF I HAD USED ASYMMETRIC THRUST AND STILL GONE OFF THE TXWY; THE L ENG WOULD HAVE SUSTAINED MUCH DAMAGE; AS IT IS NOW IT DOES NOT. ALSO; IF I HAD USED ASSYMETRIC THRUST AND IT KEPT ME FROM DEPARTING THE TXWY; I STILL HAD NO BRAKES TO STOP. THE END OF TXWY BRAVO WAS APPROACHING; I WOULD HAVE GONE OFF THE END. I KNOW MY JUDGEMENT IN THIS INCIDENT WAS CORRECT AND ANY OTHER REACTION THAN THE ONE I HAD; WOULD HAVE BEEN INAPPROPRIATE AND CAUSED MUCH MORE DAMAGE. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THE ACFT STARTED TO STRAY L AND WHY CTL INPUTS WERE NOT EFFECTIVE. NOR DO I HAVE ANY IDEA AS TO WHY THE BRAKES FAILED.",,,,"LOSS OF ACFT CTL IN TAXIING TFC.",

THE ACFT WAS BEING DELIVERED FOR THE PURPOSE OF SALE OR TRADE; I DON'T KNOW WHICH. I ASKED THE OWNER OF THE ACFT FOR THE MAINT RECORDS AND HE INFORMED ME THAT THEY WERE LOCATED ELSEWHERE. I ASKED IF THE ANNUAL AND THE AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES WERE ALL COMPLIED WITH. HE INFORMED ME THEY WERE. I TOOK HIS WORD FOR IT. TKOF THROUGH CRUISE WAS UNEVENTFUL EXCEPT THAT I DID NOT GET A GREEN INDICATOR LIGHT ON THE R MAIN AFTER TKOF. I RETRACTED THE GEAR IN A NORMAL FASHION AND ASKED THE TWR IF ALL 3 GEARS WERE UP. THEY RESPONDED THAT THEY APPEARED TO BE UP. THE OWNER OF THE ACFT CALLED THE TWR ON THE TWR FREQ AND ASKED THEM TO RELAY TO ME THAT THE LIGHT IN QUESTION HAD TO BE MANIPULATED SOMEWHAT ON OCCASION TO ILLUMINATE. AFTER PASSING CTY VOR I FELT A SHUDDER AND SLIGHT YAW TO THE L; I IMMEDIATELY CHKED FUEL SELECTORS WERE ON PROPER TANKS AND FUEL QUANTITY INDICATORS WERE WITHIN LIMITS. LOOKING OUT BEHIND THE L NACELLE I SAW BLUE/GRAY SMOKE TRAILING BEHIND THE L ENG. THE L ENG BEGAN TO SHUDDER VIOLENTLY AND I IMMEDIATELY SET BOTH MIXTURES TO FULL RICH; PROPS FORWARD; I REDUCED BOTH THROTTLES TO IDLE TO BEGIN A DSCNT FROM 8500 FT. I WAS 6-8 MI NW OF CTY ON V-7. VISIBILITY WAS AT LEAST 20 MI AND CTY ARPT WAS CLRLY IN VIEW. AT APPROX 5500 FT I MOVED THE THROTTLES FORWARD TO APPROX 1800 RPM TO SLOW MY RATE OF DSCNT. UPON DOING SO; THE L ENG INBOARD COWLING WAS BROKEN OPEN BY A CYLINDER WHICH HAD SEPARATED IN HALF; OIL POURED OUT LIBERALLY OVER THE WING. WHEN I HAD THE RWY ASSURED; I LOWERED THE GEAR; 2 GREEN LIGHTS ILLUMINATED UNTIL I MANIPULATED THE THIRD (3 GREEN). THE LNDG AND ROLLOUT WERE NORMAL. WHILE CLRING THE RWY; I LOST SUFFICIENT AIRFLOW OVER THE RUDDER TO MAINTAIN STEERABILITY AND STOPPED THE ACFT. OVER THE NEXT FEW WKS I ACCOMPANIED AN AIRFRAME AND PWRPLANT MECH TO CTY WHO CONDUCTED REPAIR WORK ON THE AFFECTED ENG. I CONDUCTED A THOROUGH PREFLT ONCE AGAIN. 3 QUARTS OF OIL WERE ADDED TO THE R ENG AND 1 QUART TO THE L. THE R MAIN TANK FUEL LEVEL WAS EASILY REACHED WITH MY FUEL TESTER. THE R AUX TANK WAS ABOUT 3/4 FULL. THE L MAIN FUEL LEVEL COULD BARELY BE REACHED WITH MY FUEL TESTER. THE L AUX TANK OVERFLOWED WHEN I OPENED THE CAP. (15 GALLONS OF FUEL HAD BEEN PUT INTO THE L MAIN DURING MAINT.) THE L ENG STARTED AFTER ONLY ABOUT 4 REVOLUTIONS. THE R ENG TOOK ABOUT 3-4 MINS TO START DUE TO HAVING BEEN FLOODED. ONCE STARTED; BOTH SETS OF ENG INSTS INDICATED NORMAL. I CONDUCTED 3 MAGNETO CHKS ON EACH ENG; CYCLED PROPS 3 TIMES AND FEATHER CHKED 3 TIMES. I COMPLETED ALL PRE-TKOF CHKS; REVIEWED V SPDS AND MADE A DETERMINATION OF WHERE I WOULD 'GO-NO-GO;' BASED ON RWY LENGTH; ACFT PERFORMANCE; AND MY OWN LIMITATIONS. AT 4500 FT I SET THE THROTTLES TO 22 INCHES -- 2400 RPM; LEANED MIXTURES FOR 14 GALLONS PER HR ON L AND 13 GALLONS PER HR ON R. ABEAM THE PERRY FOLEY ARPT; I ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT TLH APCH CTL. I HEARD THEM WELL; THEY SAID I WAS UNREADABLE. AT 27 MI FOR TLH I ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT APCH AGAIN. A FLT RELAYED MY XMISSION FOR ME. I COULD HEAR TLH APCH CTL PERFECTLY AND ACKNOWLEDGED THEIR XMISSION WITH IDENT AS INSTRUCTED. WHEN ABEAM RWY 9 AT TLH APPROX 6 MI OUT; I BEGAN TO AGAIN FEEL THE SAME SHUDDER AS BEFORE AND A SLIGHT INTERMITTENT YAW TO THE L. ENG INSTS WERE ALL IN THE GREEN; HOWEVER; THE L ENG RPM CONTINUED TO DECREASE AND SURGE. I SWITCHED THE L FUEL SELECTOR BACK TO THE L MAIN WITH NO IMPROVEMENT IN ENG PERFORMANCE; THEN BACK TO THE L AUX. I SELECTED BOTH MIXTURE CTLS TO FULL RICH; PROPS FORWARD; AND THROTTLES FORWARD. I CORRECTED THE YAW WITH R RUDDER; IDENTED THE L ENG AS FAILING; VERIFIED WITH PWR REDUCTION ON L THROTTLE; CLOSED THE L THROTTLE; FEATHERED THE L ENG; AND CLOSED THE L MIXTURE AND FUEL SELECTOR. I CALLED TLH APCH; INFORMED THEM OF THE FAILED ENG. I WAS CLRED TO LAND IMMEDIATELY. I MANEUVERED THE ACFT FOR RWY 9 AT TLH. I DID NOT LOWER THE GEAR UNTIL I HAD THE RWY ASSURED PER MY TRAINING AND THE CHKLIST. I CHKED THE GEAR LIGHTS AND SAW BOTH GREEN. MY ATTN WAS PRIMARILY OUTSIDE. I ANNOUNCED '3 IN THE GREEN.' AIRSPD WAS 110 (10 MI PER HR BELOW VYSE). ALT WAS LESS THAN 300 AGL; THESE 2 CONDITIONS REQUIRED A COMMITMENT TO LAND. AT TOUCHDOWN THE MAINS SEEMED SOLID; I LOWERED THE NOSE TO INCREASE AIRFLOW OVER THE RUDDER AND TO ATTEMPT TO GAIN USE OF THE NOSEWHEEL STEERING AS THE ACFT HAD DRIFTED L OF CTRLINE. THE MOMENT THE NOSEWHEEL TOUCHED; ALL 3 GEAR COLLAPSED AND THE ACFT SLID TO A STOP. WHILE IT SLID; I SECURED THE R FUEL SELECTOR; MAGNETOS; AND MASTER; AND UNLATCHED THE CABIN DOOR. AFTER ALL MOVEMENT STOPPED; I UNLATCHED MY SEAT BELT; OPENED THE CABIN DOOR AND EXITED THE ACFT. I MADE SEVERAL MISTAKES IN THIS INCIDENT; BEGINNING WHEN I PICKED UP THE 310. I SHOULD HAVE INSISTED ON A CHKOUT FROM THE OWNER OR QUALIFIED PERSON. I DID NOT. I SHOULD HAVE INSISTED ON HAVING MAINT RECORDS. I DID NOT. I SHOULD NOT HAVE ACCEPTED THE ACFT WITH INSPECTION PANELS REMOVED IN THE CABIN AND SEATS REMOVED AND STOWED IN THE BAGGAGE AREA. REGARDING THE FLT FROM CTY TO 71J; I SHOULD HAVE ASKED THE AIRFRAME AND PWRPLANT IF THE ACFT WAS READY TO FLY. I DID NOT. I DID NOT KNOW THE ACFT HAD TO BE RELEASED BY THE MECH PRIOR TO FLT. I DID NOT KNOW THE ACFT WAS CONSIDERED UNAIRWORTHY UNTIL THE MECH RELEASED IT. FROM NOW ON I WILL BE SURE OF AN ACFT'S AIRWORTHINESS BEFORE FLT.",,,,"SMT ON FERRY FLT HAS ENG PROB AND LNDG GEAR COLLAPSE ON ROLLOUT.",

I WAS SOLO PLT FLYING A CESSNA 310. WX WAS LOW IFR. TWR HAD LIMITED OR NO VISIBILITY TO TKOF AREA. ACTIVITY WAS BUSY. I HAVE NOT LISTENED TO THE TAPES THOUGH I HAD A LENGTHY DISCUSSION WITH THE CTLR BY PHONE UPON LNDG. HE HAD LISTENED TO THE TAPES. WHAT FOLLOWS IS MY BEST MEMORY RECOLLECTION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. TWR TOLD THE ACR TO 'CROSS RWY 5R; TAXI INTO POS AND HOLD ON RWY 5L;' IMMEDIATELY AFTER TWR TOLD ME TO 'HOLD SHORT RWY 5R.' UPON HEARING THIS; I APPARENTLY REGISTERED THE 'INTO POS AND HOLD' INSTRUCTION FOR THE ACR AND HEARD THE RWY 5R IN MY CLRNC AND PROCEEDED TO TAXI INTO POS AND HOLD ON RWY 5R. I READ BACK MY INSTRUCTIONS (ACCORDING TO THE BEST OF MY MEMORY) AS WHAT I INCORRECTLY DID AND NOT WHAT I HAD BEEN ACTUALLY TOLD. BECAUSE OF THE BUSINESS OF THE FREQS THERE HAD BEEN SOME TENDENCIES TOWARD ABBREVIATION WHICH I MAY ALSO HAVE DONE IN MY READBACK BUT I AM FAIRLY CERTAIN I SAID THE WORDS 'INTO POS AND HOLD.' THE TWR HAD NO VISUAL CONTACT TO CATCH THE ERROR AND EITHER DID NOT HEAR OR MISINTERPRETED MY READBACK WHICH WAS INCORRECT. MEANWHILE A JET WAS ON FINAL FOR LNDG ON RWY 5R. WHEN THE JET BROKE OUT IT APPARENTLY SAW ME ON THE RWY AND INITIATED A MISSED APCH. TWR INQUIRED AS TO WHETHER I WAS ON THE RWY OR HOLDING SHORT. MEANWHILE THE JET HAD PASSED OVERHEAD; I REALIZED THE MISTAKE; TWR INSTRUCTED ME TO PROCEED TO RWY 5L AND SHORTLY CLRED ME FOR TKOF. THE JET CIRCLED AND LANDED WITH NO APPARENT MISHAP. MY OBSERVATIONS ARE SUCH: DID I MAKE A MISTAKE? WITHOUT LISTENING TO THE TAPES I WILL NOT SAY BUT THERE IS A VERY STRONG LIKELIHOOD THAT I DID HEAR THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE ACR AND MYSELF SO CLOSELY TOGETHER THAT I INCORRECTLY INTERPRETED THEM. DID I DO A READBACK? YES. WAS MY READBACK CORRECT? AGAIN; WITHOUT LISTENING TO THE TAPES I CANNOT SAY FOR SURE WHAT WAS SAID BUT IN A CONVERSATION WITH THE CTLR HE INDICATED THAT I HAD READ BACK WHAT I DID -- NOT WHAT I WAS TOLD TO DO. DID THE TWR MAKE A MISTAKE? PERHAPS; BUT THIS IS CLRLY A CASE WHERE BLAME PROBABLY DOES NOT REST 100 PERCENT ON ANYONE'S SHOULDERS BUT IS PROBABLY SPREAD BTWN THE PLT AND THE TWR. WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE TO PREVENT THIS INCIDENT? NEEDLESS TO SAY; I; AS A PLT; MUST EXERCISE 100 PERCENT CONCENTRATION ON GND INSTRUCTION; PARTICULARLY IN POOR VISIBILITY SITS. HOWEVER; IT IS MUCH MORE COMMON FOR ME TO HEAR IN HOLD SHORT INSTRUCTIONS THE PHRASE 'LNDG TFC.' WHILE I REALIZE THE CTLR IS NOT REQUIRED TO SAY THIS AND THAT AS A PLT I AM SUPPOSED TO HEAR 'HOLD SHORT' ALONE AND OBEY REGARDLESS OF THE REASON. IN THIS CASE WITH AN INSTRUCTION OF 'TAXI INTO POS AND HOLD' BEING GIVEN TO THE OTHER PLT FOLLOWED BY THE PHRASE 'HOLD SHORT' TO ME; IF THE PHRASE THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN TO ME WAS 'HOLD SHORT RWY 5R LNDG TFC' I THINK I WOULD HAVE CAUGHT THIS AND NOT MADE THIS ERROR. IT WOULD BE MY SUGGESTION TO ATC TO CONSIDER REQUIRING THE USE OF THE PHRASE 'LNDG TFC' FOR ALL HOLD SHORT INSTRUCTIONS IN CONDITIONS OF LOW VISIBILITY WHERE NEITHER THE TWR NOR THE TWO PLTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO VISUALLY SEE MISTAKES IN ACTIONS BY THE PLT ON THE GND. THE TENERIFE PANAM COLLISION AND THE LAX USAIR ACCIDENT SHOW THAT THIS ERROR CAN ALSO HAPPEN WITH PLTS WHO HAVE FAR MORE HRS THAN MYSELF. IN BOTH INCIDENTS WAS THE PHRASE 'LNDG TFC' USED? AND IF IT WASN'T; WOULD THOSE 2 WORDS HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE IN THE PLT'S INTERP OF THE INFO?",,,,"SMT CONFUSES CLRNC AND MOVES INTO POS AND HOLD WITH LNDG TFC.",

JUST AS THE AIRPLANE ROTATED I SMELLED PLASTIC BURNING (EXTREMELY STRONG). AT 200 FT AGL (600 FT MSL) I SAW SMOKE COMING FROM THE AVIONICS. I IMMEDIATELY DECIDED TO MAKE A LNDG. ALL NON ESSENTIAL AVIONICS WERE TURNED OFF WHILE I MADE AN IMMEDIATE 180 DEG TURN TO ENTER DOWNWIND. ANOTHER PLT WAS ALONG FOR THE RIDE AND I TOLD HIM TO CALL THE TWR AND ADVISE THEM THAT WE HAD A PROB AND WERE GOING TO MAKE AN IMMEDIATE LNDG. AS I WAS MAKING THE 180 DEG TURN TO DOWNWIND AN AEROSPATIALE TAMPICO CLUB WAS ABOUT TO ENTER DOWNWIND. THE OTHER ACFT WAS IN SIGHT BY MYSELF AND THE OTHER PLT WITH ME. WE WERE WELL BELOW AND FAR AHEAD OF THE TAMPICO AND WERE FLYING MUCH FASTER; THE TAMPICO WAS NOT GOING TO BE A FACTOR AND THERE WAS NO ACTUAL CONFLICT. WHEN WE CALLED FOR AN IMMEDIATE LNDG THE TAMPICO STARTED AN IMMEDIATE CLB AND TURNOUT OF THE TFC PATTERN. THE TAMPICO MUST HAVE HAD US IN SIGHT (AND AN INSTRUCTOR MOST LIKELY IN THE AIRPLANE WITH A STUDENT). THE TWR CANCELED LNDG CLRNCS FOR ALL ACFT AND CLRED US FOR LNDG ON ANY RWY OF OUR CHOICE. I TOLD THE OTHER PLT TO ADVISE THE TWR THAT WE HAD SMOKE IN THE CABIN. HE INSTEAD TOLD THEM WE HAD A FIRE IN THE AIRPLANE. TWR IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE LCL FIRE DEPT. A LNDG WAS MADE WITHOUT INCIDENT AND WE RETURNED TO THE RAMP. TWR CANCELED THE FIRE CALL. LATER INVESTIGATION OF THE AVIONICS REVEALED A DEFECTIVE ADF WHICH HAD TO BE REMOVED FROM THE ACFT AND DISCARDED. THERE WAS NO ACTUAL CONFLICT OR INCIDENT. EVERYONE HAD EVERYONE ELSE IN SIGHT AND COULD SEE WHAT THE OTHERS WERE DOING. DUE TO THE EXTREMELY STRONG BURNING SMELL AND ACTUAL SMOKE IN THE CABIN THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO LAND IMMEDIATELY. THE LONGEST/WIDEST RWY WAS THE ONE I DEPARTED FROM. A 180 DEG TURN BACK TO THE RWY WOLD NOT HAVE BEEN PRACTICAL AND MAY HAVE CONFLICTED WITH OTHER ACFT I DID NOT HAVE IN SIGHT. BEST ALTERNATIVE WAS TO CUT IN FRONT OF AND BELOW THE ACFT IN SIGHT; IT WAS THE ONLY AIRPLANE IN THE PATTERN FOR THE RWY OF INTENDED LNDG.",,,,"PLT OF A PVT C310 ACFT RETURNED AND LANDED JUST AFTER TKOF DUE SMOKE IN THE COCKPIT.",

PREVIOUSLY; I HAD FLOWN IN THE AIR FORCE ALMOST ALWAYS UNDER IFR; SO MY PRESENT JOB INVOLVES A LESS RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT FLYING VFR AND OFTEN FROM UNCTLED FIELDS; REQUIRING MORE DECISION MAKING ON MY PART. ALMOST ALWAYS WHEN I FLY OUT OF FALCON FIELD (OUR COMPANY BASE OF OPS); THE TWR IS CLOSED AND I AM ACCUSTOMED TO TAXIING; TAKING OFF; AND LNDG ON MY OWN; SIMPLY ANNOUNCING MY INTENTIONS ON CTAF. THE DAY OF THIS INCIDENT; I WAS FLYING A DIFFERENT MODEL CESSNA 310 FROM WHAT I NORMALLY FLY WHICH HAD A DIFFERENT RADIO SETUP FROM WHAT I'M USED TO. I HAD FLOWN IT ONLY ONCE BEFORE SEVERAL WKS PRIOR AND I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT THIS PARTICULAR AIRPLANE HAD 2 DIFFERENT CTL HEADS FOR THE #1 RADIO; LOCATED IN THE CTR OF THE INST PANEL. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THE #2 RADIO WAS LOCATED DOWN NEAR MY R KNEE. INSTEAD; I THOUGHT THE #2 RADIO WAS THE CTL HEAD ON THE R IN THE CTR OF THE INST PANEL; WHEN IN FACT THAT IS PART OF THE #1 RADIO; CTLED BY A TOGGLE SWITCH WHICH IS HARD TO SEE FROM THE PLT'S SEAT IN THE DARK CONDITIONS I HAD THAT MORNING. ALSO ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY; I WAS RUNNING ABOUT 20 MINS LATE FOR MY SCHEDULED CARGO PICKUP AT PHX ARPT DUE TO A SERIES OF UNUSUAL DELAYS ON THE GND; SOME OF WHICH WERE MY FAULT; AND I FELT A LOT OF PRESSURE TO GET FLYING ASAP TO MEET OUR COMMITMENT TO OUR CUSTOMER AND AVOID TROUBLE WITH CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS. NORMALLY; I TAXI AND TKOF BEFORE FALCON TWR OPENS AT XA00 LCL TIME; BUT BECAUSE I WAS BEHIND THAT DAY; I BEGAN TAXIING A FEW MINS AFTER XA00. BEFORE TAXI; I ATTEMPTED TO LISTEN TO ATIS; BUT HEARD NOTHING. I TRIED CALLING GND FOR TAXI CLRNC ON WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE #1 RADIO; BUT HEARD NO RESPONSE. I LOOKED AT THE TWR AS I TAXIED AND IT DIDN'T APPEAR THAT THERE WAS ANYBODY IN IT. I SWITCHED TO CTAF (TWR FREQ) AND ANNOUNCED MY TAXI INTENTIONS; THINKING THAT IF THERE WAS SOMEONE IN THE TWR THEY WOULD ANSWER; BUT I GOT NO RESPONSE. I THOUGHT THIS WAS ALL RATHER STRANGE; BUT THOUGHT THAT MAYBE THE TWR WAS OPENING LATER THAN I EXPECTED SO I CONTINUED MY TAXI. NORMALLY; I WOULD DEPART ON RWY 22L (THE CLOSEST RWY TO OUR PARKING AREA); BUT IT WAS NOTAMED CLOSED AND THE PARALLEL TXWY LEADING OUT TO IT WAS CLOSED SO I CONTINUED TAXIING FOR RWY 22R. BECAUSE OF THE BLOCKED TXWYS; I THOUGHT I HAD TO BACK TAXI DOWN THE RWY FOR TKOF (IT WAS DARK OUTSIDE AND I WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH THE TXWYS LEADING TO RWY 22R SINCE THE NORMAL ONES WERE BLOCKED). JUST AS I BEGAN TO TURN ONTO THE RWY TO BACK TAXI; AFTER HAVING ANNOUNCED MY INTENTIONS ON WHAT I THOUGHT WAS CTAF; I DID NOTICE A LIGHTED TXWY ON THE N SIDE OF RWY 22R; BUT SINCE I WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE APCH END OF RWY 22R; I ELECTED TO CONTINUE MY BACK TAXI. BEFORE TURNING ONTO THE RWY; I NOTICED AN ACFT ON WHAT APPEARED TO BE A MIDFIELD R DOWNWIND FOR RWY 22R AND I THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE HADN'T ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTIONS OR ANSWERED MY CALLS ON CTAF; BUT I COULD SEE I WOULD HAVE TIME TO BACK TAXI AND TKOF; SO I CONTINUED. BECAUSE I HAD BEEN IN A HURRY AND I WAS DISTRACTED BY ALL THE UNEXPECTED THINGS WITH NO RESPONSE TO MY RADIO CALLS; AS I TURNED THE ACFT AROUND FOR TKOF I REALIZED I HAD NOT COMPLETED MY RUNUP CHK ON THE ENGS. I TOOK A SHORT MOMENT TO PROPERLY COMPLETE THAT AND THEN TOOK OFF; ANNOUNCING MY INTENTIONS ON WHAT I THOUGHT WAS CTAF (TWR FREQ). AFTER GETTING AIRBORNE; I SWITCHED TO PHX APCH CTL TO REQUEST CLRNC INTO CLASS B AIRSPACE AND GOT NO RESPONSE. I TRIED TOGGLING THE RADIO SWITCH AND ABOUT THAT TIME NOTICED THE #2 RADIO AT MY R KNEE WHICH I HAD NOT SEEN EARLIER IN THE DARK AND IN MY HURRY. I TRIED THE DIFFERENT RADIOS AND SWITCHES AND I WAS ABLE TO CONTACT PHX APCH AND GET CLRNC FROM PHX TO LAND AT PHX ARPT. AFTER I LANDED; PHX GND CTL SAID THAT FALCON TWR WANTED ME TO CALL THEM; SO I DID AND EXPLAINED WHAT HAD HAPPENED. APPARENTLY; THEY HAD BEEN TRYING TO CALL ME; BUT COULD NOT REACH ME WHILE I TAXIED OUT OF THERE. THEY SAID THEY HAD FLASHED A RED LIGHT AT ME FROM THE TWR; BUT SINCE I THOUGHT TWR WAS CLOSED; I HADN'T LOOKED AT IT AFTER I TAXIED PAST IT. THE ACFT THAT I HAD SEEN ON DOWNWIND THEY COULD NOT CLR TO LAND UNTIL I GOT OUT OF THE WAY. ADDITIONALLY; THEY MENTIONED THAT THEY THOUGHT I WAS TAXIING FASTER THAN CONDITIONS WARRANTED. I THINK THE MAIN REASON FOR MY PROB IS THAT I WAS IN TOO BIG OF A HURRY TO GO AND I WAS TOO FOCUSED ON GETTING AIRBORNE TO SLOW DOWN AND CHK EVERYTHING THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE WRONG (RADIOS; SWITCHES; FREQS; VOLUME; ETC). GREATER FAMILIARITY AND PERHAPS MORE TRAINING IN THE DIFFERENCES OF THE RADIOS BTWN AIRPLANES WOULD HAVE HELPED; BUT SO WOULD SLOWING DOWN TO TAKE MORE TIME TO TROUBLE-SHOOT WHEN SOMETHING SEEMS OUT OF PLACE.

UPON ARRIVING AT THE SCOTTSDALE ARPT THE LOWER CLOUD LAYER OPENED AND I COULD SEE I WAS PASSING OVER THE CTR OF THE ARPT. AT THIS POINT; I IMMEDIATELY LOOKED AT MY RADAR ALTIMETER AND IT SHOWED A DIGITAL READ OUT OF 2640 FT AGL. BASED ON THIS AND THE FACT THAT THE ARPT WAS AT 1508 FT MSL; I FELT I WAS ABOVE SCOTTSDALE ARPT CLASS D CEILING OF 4000 FT MSL. THE BASE OF THE PHOENIX CLASS B AIRSPACE WAS 6000 FT AT THAT LOCATION. I HEARD THE SCOTTSDALE TWR CONTACT APCH CTL WHICH I WAS MONITORING STATING A '337' JUST PASSED OVERHEAD WITHOUT COMMUNICATING WITH THE TWR. ABOUT 6 DME BEYOND SCOTTSDALE ARPT I BEGAN A SLOW DSCNT. I LOOKED AT THE ALTIMETER DURING THIS DSCNT AND MONITORED ABOUT 3200 FT AT 7 DME FROM SCOTTSDALE ARPT. THE LOWER CLOUD LAYER WAS THINNING AGAIN TO SCATTERED.

I TRIED TO EXPLAIN I DID NOT FEEL I WAS VIOLATING HIS AIRSPACE AT THE ALT MY INSTS INDICATED. HE THEN STATED THAT CONDITIONS WERE IFR AT THE ARPT AND THAT I WAS FLYING IN IFR CONDITIONS. AGAIN I TOLD HIM I WAS FLYING BTWN CLOUD LAYERS AND I WAS MAINTAINING VFR. HE STATED THAT CONDITIONS WERE SUCH THAT I COULD NOT HAVE GOOD VISIBILITY. I TOLD HIM I HAD GOOD VISIBILITY WHERE I WAS OF 3-4 MI AND I HAD NO INTENTION OF VIOLATING HIS AIRSPACE. I FURTHER INFORMED HIM THAT I WAS IFR RATED AND HAD BEEN A PLT FOR OVER 20 YRS. I HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED AN ALT OVER POPULATED AREAS OF OVER 1000 FT AND ALWAYS KEPT CLR OF CLASS D & B AIRSPACE WITHOUT CLRNC. HE STATED THAT MY RADAR ALTIMETER WAS IN ERROR. I TRIED TO EXPLAIN THAT WHEN I GLANCED AT MY ALTIMETER AFTER 7 DME FROM THE SCOTTSDALE ARPT I WAS PASSING 3200 FT IN MY DSCNT. I ASKED HIM IF I WAS REQUIRED TO CONTACT THE ARPT IF I WAS AT ABOUT 3000 FT AGL. HE STATED THAT I MUST CONTACT THE ARPT TWR UP TO 4000 FT FOR CLASS D AIRSPACE. HE DID NOT ACCEPT ANY EXPLANATION AND STATED THAT HE WAS FILING SEVERAL FAR VIOLATIONS WITH THE FLT STANDARD OFFICE. AT THIS POINT I AM WRITING MY SIDE OF THIS CONTROVERSY.

I NOTICED; THEN; THAT I WAS FLYING INTO AN AREA OF FOG; AND OPTED TO MAKE A 180 DEG TURN. I FOUND MYSELF TRAPPED AND I DID A 360 DEG TURN; LOOKING FOR A HOLE IN THE CLOUDS. I WAS STILL IN VFR; AND FOUND A WAY OUT; WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY. I HAD TO CLB TO STAY ON TOP OF THE CLOUDS; AND THIS WAS NOT JUST 'A FEW POCKETS OF CLOUDS.' DURING THIS TIME; I WAS IN CONTACT WITH ZDV. I TOLD THEM THAT I WAS NOT ABLE TO KEEP VFR BELOW FL180. I REQUESTED TO CLB TO FL200. I WAS TOLD THAT I HAD TO FILE AN IFR PLAN. I TOLD THEM I WAS NOT IFR QUALIFIED. THE CTLR TOLD ME HE WOULD GRANT PERMISSION ONLY IN AN 'EMER SIT.' I CALLED THEM BACK; GAVE MY CALL SIGN; AND DECLARED 'EMER STATUS.' I CLBED TO FL210 FOR 15 MINS.

NOT HAVING FLOWN THE CESSNA 310 FOR 4 MONTHS; I WAS PERFORMING THE 3 REQUIRED TOUCH-AND-GOES TO REESTABLISH MY CURRENCY. ON MY SECOND APCH TO FLABOB ARPT; AFTER RPTING 'XWIND' AND 'TURNING DOWNWIND' ON UNICOM 122.8; I HEARD 2 PLTS RPT THEIR POS AS 'DOWNWIND' RWY 25 FLABOB. FLABOB'S ACTIVE RWY AT THE TIME WAS RWY 24; CORONA ARPT'S (L66) ACTIVE RWY THAT DAY WAS RWY 25. I BELIEVED THAT THESE PLTS EITHER INCORRECTLY INDICATED ARPT OF INTENDED LNDG OR INCORRECTLY INDICATED RWY HDG. MY ATTN WAS DIVERTED AS I ATTEMPTED TO VISUALLY CONFIRM THEIR ACTUAL POS. THUS; I NEGLECTED TO PERFORM MY 'GUMPS.' ADDITIONAL VISUALLY-CONFIRMED TFC IN THE PATTERN INCLUDED A LUSCOMBE ON FINAL AND A MOONEY TURNING BASE; BOTH RPTING FLABOB RWY 24 IN SIGHT. THE LUSCOMB; AT THIS POINT; WAS MAKING A TOUCHDOWN. I DECIDED TO MAINTAIN ALT AND EXECUTE A GAR AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE MOONEY MADE THE DECISION TO GAR; BASED ON THE CONFUSION OVER WHERE; IN FACT; THESE 2 PLTS ACTUALLY WERE. I DETERMINED THAT THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED ACFT WERE AT CORONA; NOT A FLABOB AS THEY HAD RPTED. AS I TURNED BASE AT PATTERN ALT; I RECONSIDERED MY DECISION TO GAR; AND DECIDED TO INSTITUTE A LNDG. I ENTERED LNDG PROFILE ESTABLISHING PROPER AIRSPD AND ALT. ON SHORT FINAL; I DECREASED PWR. A HORN SOUNDED; WHICH I INCORRECTLY INTERPRETED AS BEING A STALL WARNING HORN. MY ATTN WAS DIVERTED TO ANALYZING THE REASON FOR THE HORN; I BELIEVED THAT IF IT WAS; INDEED; THE STALL HORN; IT MAY HAVE BEEN MALFUNCTIONING; GIVEN THAT MY AIRSPD WAS INDICATING WELL ABOVE STALL SPD. I HEARD THE PROP 'TING;' AND REALIZED THAT THE HORN HAD BEEN INDICATING GEAR UP; NOT STALL. I CUT THE THROTTLES; MIXTURE; AND PROP; AND CONCENTRATED ON MAINTAINING CTL DESPITE THE INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE. 3 ISSUES NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. FIRST; DESPITE HAVING MADE OVER 600 LNDGS IN THE CESSNA C-310 AND REESTABLISHING MY CURRENCY COUNTLESS TIMES WITH NO NEGATIVE EVENTS; I NOW BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY AN INSTRUCTOR. WE MUST TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT A PLT; DESPITE A PERFECT FLYING RECORD; STILL LACKS PROFICIENCY AFTER A PERIOD OF INACTIVITY AND IS VULNERABLE TO ERRORS. SECOND; TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE HIGH NUMBER OF UNCTLED ARPTS AND THE VOLUME OF ACFT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; THE NEED FOR MORE UNICOM FREQS IS APPARENT. THIRD; THE STALL WARNING HORN AND THE GEAR WARNING HORN IN THE EARLY C-310 HAVE SUCH GREAT SIMILARITY IN THEIR INTENSITY AND TONE WHEN HEARD THROUGH NOISE-ATTENUATING HEADSETS; THAT IS INEVITABLE A PLT COULD EASILY BECOME CONFUSED; AND MISINTERPRET ONE FOR THE OTHER. ALTHOUGH CESSNA HAD CORRECTED THAT SIT IN THEIR B-MODEL ACFT BY ADDING A FLASHER TO PULSE THE AUDIBLE TONE OF THE GEAR WARNING; FLT INSTRUCTION STILL NEEDS TO INCLUDE METHODS OF DIFFERENTIATING BTWN THE STALL INDICATION AND GEAR-UP INDICATION.",,,,"GEAR UP LNDG IN A CESSNA 310.",

FINE CHOICE. I DECIDE TO STAY SLIGHTLY HIGH AND UPWIND OF APCH PATH. STILL THE WAKE IS QUITE HVY (SQUEAKING PAX AND SUCH) AND I HAVE TO TOUCH DOWN LONG TO MAKE A SAFE LNDG. I AM TOO FED UP TO CALL TWR AND NOTIFY THEM OF THE BAD SIT THEY HELPED TO CREATE. I FEEL THAT A SIT LIKE THIS CAN BE AVOIDED. FIRST; ATC SHOULD NOT SQUEEZE ANOTHER LARGE ACFT IN FOR TKOF IF A SMALL AIRPLANE IS FOLLOWING A HVY. THE 3 MI SEPARATION BEHIND THE HVY MAKES SENSE; AND SQUEEZING A DEPARTING LARGE ACFT IN MAY BE FINE AND LEGAL AS FAR AS THE ATC'S HANDBOOK IS CONCERNED; BUT IT SURE IS RUDE AND NOT VERY THOUGHTFUL. SECOND; I THINK ONE SHOULD INDEED REJECT THE LNDG IN SUCH A SIT; GAR AND EXPLAIN TO ATC WHY. THEY MAY BE FED UP; BUT I FOUND THAT A CLARIFYING CALL TO THE TWR MGR USUALLY HELPS. I STILL FEEL THAT THERE IS A LOOPHOLE IN THE WAKE SEPARATION STANDARDS PERMITTING SUCH A PRACTICE. THE TRAILING PLT HAS TO MAKE A PLAN TO AVOID A HVY'S WAKE; AND I WANT TO BE SURE THAT I CAN RELY ON MY 3 NM SEPARATION. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS NO SUCH REQUIREMENT BEHIND A LARGE ACFT AND IT APPEARS PERFECTLY LEGAL TO PLACE A LARGE ACFT'S WAKE IN BTWN THESE 3 NM; BUT IT SURE DOES FOLLOW ONLY THE LETTER OF THE LAW; AND NOT THE SPIRIT. ALSO; IF I TRY TO COOPERATE WITH ATC BY KEEPING SPDS UP TO FIT INTO A TRANSPORT JET PATTERN; THEN I DO NOT WANT STUNTS LIKE THAT PULLED ON ME.

I APOLOGIZE FOR TAKING UP YOUR TIME WITH A RPT THAT OFFERS; IN MY OPINION; LITTLE THAT CAN BENEFIT OTHERS. MY ONLY THOUGHTS ARE THAT PERHAPS WHEN LIGHTLY LOADED AND CLBING A VY IN A TURN; WHEN VIEWED FROM THE GND ON THE INSIDE OF A TURN A CESSNA 310 MAY APPEAR TO BE BANKED MORE STEEPLY THAN IT ACTUALLY IS. MY OTHER THOUGHT IS THAT A QUICK TURN WHEN LESS THAN 500 FT AGL MAY SEEM UNSAFE. THE LATTER I AGREE COULD BE A PROB; BUT I WAS FLYING OVER THE RWY COMPLEX; AN ENVIRONMENT FREE OF OBSTACLES; AND I DETERMINED THAT IT WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF SAFETY TO ASSIST ATC AS BEST I COULD. I REALIZE THAT THE ENFORCEMENT DIVISION OF THE FAA IS A VERY NECESSARY CHK AND BAL FOR AVIATORS; BUT FOR SERIOUS SAFETY-CONSCIOUS PLTS IT IS OCCURRENCES LIKE THESE THAT GIVE US UNNEEDED STRESS AND EXTRA GRAY HAIR FOR THE BENEFIT OF NO ONE.

I WAS ALSO EXPERIENCING THE WORST ST ELMO'S FIRE I HAVE EVER SEEN. THE L ENG ENCOUNTERED INDUCTION ICING AND BEGAN TO QUIT; ALSO THE GS BEGAN TO BECOME INTERMITTENT AND FLAG. I HAD TRIED TO BOOT THE ICE OFF THE WINGS BUT TO NO AVAIL. I DECIDED TO BREAK OFF THE APCH AND INTERCEPT VICTOR 247 WHICH I HAD BEEN ON BEFORE RECEIVING APCH CLRNC BECAUSE I KNOW THE RTE WAS VFR TO THE E 20 DME. IT WAS SOMETIME DURING THE INTERCEPT TO VICTOR 247 THAT I MANAGED TO GET THE L ENG BACK TO FULL PWR BY PULLING THE ALTERNATE AIR DOOR.

I WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE TO HAVE PROBS. 2 OTHER ACFT DECLARED EMERS. I FEEL I MADE THE BEST POSSIBLE DECISION BY TURNING AROUND AND LEAVING THE AREA. THE ILS RWY 27 APCH INTO HLN IS WELL KNOWN FOR POCKETS OF SEVERE ICING. WITH THE STATIC ELECTRICITY AFFECTING THE NAV RADIOS; I HAD BEGUN TO DOUBT MY SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. THE L ENG WAS PROBABLY ONLY MAKING 35-40 PERCENT PWR; AND I FELT WITH THE MODERATE TO SEVERE TURB INVOLVED WITH THE PASSAGE OF THIS FRONT; CONTINUATION OF THE APCH WOULD PRODUCE DISASTROUS RESULTS. I FEEL THIS SIT WAS CAUSED BY UNFORECAST SEVERE ICING CONDITIONS AND MAY NOT HAVE BEEN PREVENTED BUT THE DANGER WAS INTENSIFIED BY HLN NOT HAVING RADAR. IF RADAR WOULD HAVE BEEN IN PLACE AT HLN THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A DOUBT TO THE CTLRS OF MY POS AT ANY TIME. I ALSO FAILED TO DECLARE AN EMER; WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENED BEFORE I DEVIATED BACK TO VFR CONDITIONS. IN MY MIND; I MADE THE RIGHT MOVES BECAUSE I HAD BEGAN TO DOUBT MYSELF AND EQUIP. HLN IS SURROUNDED BY MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN AND IS NOT A PLACE TO DOUBT ONE'S EQUIP.

A STORM HAD PASSED THROUGH EARLIER IN THE DAY. I WAS FLYING THE ILS 6 APCH. AS THE RWY CAME INTO SIGHT; ABOUT 10 MI OUT; I NOTED THAT THE RWY WAS COVERED WITH SNOW. WINDS WERE INCREASING. A FINAL WIND CHK INDICATED THAT WINDS WERE 310 DEGS AT 19 KTS GUSTING TO 26 KTS. I ASKED TWR ABOUT BRAKING CONDITIONS AND WAS TOLD FIRST THIRD WAS FAIR LAST 2/3 WERE POOR. RWY 1/19 HAD BEEN CLOSED ALL DAY AND HAD BEEN NOTAMED IN MY MORNING BRIEFING AND ON THE ATIS. RWY 6 WAS BEING USED BECAUSE THE OPPOSITE END (WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN RWY 24 AND WOULD HAVE PUT ME INTO A QUARTERING HEADWIND) HAD; I ASSUMED; NOT BEEN PLOWED AND SIMPLY HAD TOO MUCH SNOW. UPON LNDG; THE PLANE VEERED TO THE L AND STARTED TO RUN OFF THE RWY. I APPLIED R RUDDER; GENTLY TRYING TO RETURN THE PLANE TO THE CTR OF THE RWY BUT THE WINDS WHICH WERE NOW DIRECTLY BEHIND AND GUSTING VERY STRONGLY DROVE THE PLANE TO THE R AND THE PLANE CAME TO A HALT IN A SNOWBANK ON THE R SIDE OF THE RWY. THE RWY WAS EXTREMELY SLICK. THE SNOW WAS COVERING A SOLID SHEET OF ICE. UPON REFLECTION I SHOULD HAVE ABORTED THE LNDG AND GONE TO ANOTHER ARPT WHERE WIND AND RWY CONDITIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE FAVORABLE.

NO ONE SEEMED OVERLY CONCERNED IN LISTENING TO THE TWR/PLT CONVERSATIONS. WHAT I WAS NOT AWARE OF WAS THAT ALL THE PLANES LNDG THAT DAY HAD BEEN JETS WHICH WERE MUCH HEAVIER. THERE APPARENTLY HAD BEEN ALMOST NO PISTON PLANES THAT HAD LANDED. A HIGH RANKING INDIVIDUAL TOLD ME; OFF THE RECORD; THAT HE FELT THE ARPT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSED IF RWY 24 COULD NOT BE OPENED. I'M SURE THE REASON IT WAS NOT WAS DUE TO THE HVY AMOUNT OF CORP JET TFC AND THE INCONVENIENCE THAT WOULD BE CAUSED. IS IT NOT POSSIBLE THAT AN ARPT LIKE TEB SHOULD ON RARE OCCASIONS LIKE THIS BE CLOSED TO PISTON PLANE OR PLANES UNDER A CERTAIN GROSS WT AND ONLY OPEN TO TURBINE AND HEAVIER CRAFT? IS IT DISCRIMINATORY TO SIMPLY SAY THIS ARPT AND THESE CONDITIONS ARE SAFE FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF ACFT AND NOT FOR OTHERS? AND IF PLTS DO NOT WISH TO GIVE UP THIS DECISION PROCESS; WOULD IT NOT BE PRACTICAL TO NOTE THIS ON THE ATIS: WIND AND RWY CONDITIONS MAKE LNDG ACFT UNDER XXXX LBS GROSS WT INADVISABLE. YES; I SHOULD HAVE LOOKED AT THE INFO COPIED FROM THE ATIS PERHAPS MORE CAREFULLY; AND YES WHEN THE TWR TOLD ME THE WINDS ON MY FINAL WIND CHK AND RPTED THE POOR BRAKING CONDITIONS I SHOULD HAVE ABORTED BUT I WAS DECEIVED BY THE CALM BANTER BTWN PLTS IN FRONT AND BEHIND.

I EVEN RECALL LOOKING AT THE RWY IDENTIFIER SIGN AND SEEING RWY 5L-23R WHICH CONFIRMED MY BELIEF THAT I WAS AT RWY 5L.JUST AS I HAD INSTRUCTED; THE PLT FLYING WITH ME CALLED THE TWR AND ADVISED THEM THAT WE WERE READY FOR TKOF ON RWY 5R. THE TWR INSTRUCTED US TO TAXI INTO POS AND HOLD AND WE TAXIED INTO POS ON RWY 23L.

WE IMMEDIATELY TAXIED BACK OFF OF THE RWY AND CONTINUED TO THE OPPOSITE END FOR DEP ON RWY 5R VIA THE PARALLEL TXWY. THIS INCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY AN IMPROPER MENTAL MAP THAT WENT UNCHKED. I HAD NO REASON TO QUESTION MY MENTAL PICTURE BECAUSE THE TAXI INSTRUCTIONS THAT I WAS GIVEN TOOK ME EXACTLY WHERE I THOUGHT I SHOULD BE GOING. I HAD THE ARPT DIAGRAM IN FRONT OF ME AS I TAXIED.

HOWEVER; I DID NOT USE THE DIAGRAM TO LOCATE THE RWY BECAUSE I KNEW; OR AT LEAST I THOUGHT I KNEW; WHERE THE RWY WAS LOCATED.

A FEW HAVE BEEN FROM RWYS 23R AND 32 BUT I HAVE NEVER DEPARTED RWYS 5R OR 5L. THE INCIDENT COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN ADVERTED HAD I PAID MORE ATTN TO THE RWY 5L-23R SIGN. IT CLRLY SHOWED THAT I WAS ON THE WRONG END OF THE RWY. HOWEVER; I WAS CONFIDENT AS TO MY LOCATION AND SEEING RWY 5L ON THE SIGN ONLY SOLIDIFIED MY BELIEFS.

I THEN TOLD THE SOUTH BEND APCH CTLR; WHO I JUST MOMENTS BEFORE CHKED IN WITH; THAT I HAD JUST SHUT DOWN MY R ENG; AND THAT I WANTED TO LAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. HE ACKNOWLEDGED AND BEGAN VECTORING ME FOR THE ILS RWY IN USE TO SBN WHICH WAS ONLY ABOUT 12-15 MI TO THE N OF ME. BUT AT THE TIME I DID NOT KNOW MY POS RELATIVE TO SBN OR THE FINAL APCH COURSE.

HDOF FROM ZKC TO WICHITA APCH UNEVENTFUL. VECTORS AND ALT CHANGES TO INTERCEPT THE LOC BACK COURSE WERE FLOWN WITH THE AUTOPLT ON WITH HDG BUG SELECTED; AND ALT HOLD (DURING LEVEL SEGMENTS OF THE FLT AND APCH). EVERYTHING WAS AS EXPECTED UNTIL THE TURN ONTO THE LOC. WHILE COMPLETING THE TURN ONTO THE LOC AT 3000 FT MSL I DID PUSH THE ALT HOLD; BUT BEFORE I COULD LOOK TO SEE IF THE HOLD ALT CONFIRMATION LIGHT CAME ON I CHANGED TO TWR FREQ. WHEN I CHKED IN WITH THE TWR I WAS REQUESTED TO RPT XING STORG INTXN. ALTHOUGH I HAD ALREADY DIALED IN THE VOR AND RADIAL FOR STORG IN THE #2 RADIO; I DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE NAME AND LOOKED DOWN ONTO THE APCH PLATE TO CONFIRM THAT IT WAS NOT A POINT I HAD ALREADY PASSED OR WAS CURRENTLY OVER AS I HAD JUST INTERCEPTED THE LOC BACK COURSE FOR RWY 31. AS TWILIGHT WAS IN PROCESS AND THE ACFT WAS IN IMC CONDITIONS; LIGHTING AT LAP LEVEL WAS LESS THAN OPTIMUM. RATHER THAN TAKE THE TIME TO BRING UP THE CABIN LIGHTS I MADE THE MISTAKE OF SETTING THE SMALL METAL CLIPBOARD WITH THE APCH PLATES AGAINST THE TOP OF THE PLT CTL YOKE. AS I LOOKED UP TO CONFIRM THE VOR AND RADIAL SETTINGS I NOTED THAT I WAS XING OUT OF THE LOC BUT DID NOT YET COMPREHEND THAT I HAD TURNED OFF THE AUTOPLT. WITH THE FALSE ASSUMPTION THAT THE ALT HOLD WAS ENGAGED I LOOKED UP AT THE GPS DISPLAY THAT DID CONFIRM THE WORSENING POS ERROR. AS I REACHED OVER AND TURNED OFF THE AUTOPLT SWITCH ON THE FACE PLATE I SAW THAT I HAD DSNDED AND WAS OFF COURSE. STILL NOT COMPREHENDING HOW I HAD TURNED OFF THE AUTOPLT I ASSUMED THAT THERE WAS SOME OTHER PROB. I DID REAPPLY PWR; CLB; AND REQUEST MISSED APCH VECTORS AS I WAS NOT IN A POS TO REINTERCEPT THE LOC BACK COURSE. AS I WAS VECTORED FOR A SECOND APCH FOR THE LOC BACK COURSE RWY 31 I WAS NOT COMPLETELY SURE WHAT I HAD DONE OR DID NOT DO ON THE FIRST APCH THAT HAD RESULTED IN BOTH DIRECTIONAL AND ALT ERRORS. I HAD BOTH ANXIETY AND CONCERN ABOUT THE PREVIOUS APCH AND WAS DISTRACTED AS I STARTED THE SECOND INTERCEPT OF THE LOC BACK COURSE RWY 31. IN FACT I WAS DISTRACTED ENOUGH THAT I WAS TRYING TO FLY THE CORRECTIONS AS IF IT WAS A LOC RATHER THAN THE REVERSED CORRECTIONS REQUIRED FOR A LOC BACK COURSE. I REQUESTED VECTORS AND A CLB TO 4000 FT SO THAT I COULD ANALYZE THE SIT AS I NEITHER TRUSTED THE LOC BACK COURSE SIGNAL NOR MY RECEIVER. IN VFR CONDITIONS ABOVE THE CLOUD TOPS I FINALLY REALIZED WHAT I HAD DONE. I THEN REQUESTED THE VOR RWY 3 AND HAD AN UNEVENTFUL APCH AND LNDG. IN RETROSPECT IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I FLEW A LOC BACK COURSE OTHER THAN ON A SIMULATOR. IN ADDITION THERE IS A BUTTON ON THE ACFT AUTOPLT (LOC BACK COURSE) THAT ALLOWS THE NAV FUNCTION TO FLY REVERSED CORRECTIONS. SINCE I HAVE NOT USED THIS FUNCTION IN PRACTICE SITS I DID NOT TRUST IT TO WORK IN ACTUAL IFR CONDITIONS. THE UNEXPECTED DSCNT BELOW ALT CAUSED ENOUGH DISTRACTING ANXIETY THAT I SHOULD HAVE REFUSED THE SECOND APCH UNTIL I EITHER UNDERSTOOD THE FIRST PROB OR WAS CALMER. THE SECOND APCH ONLY ADDED TO THE STRESS. I DID NOT HAVE MY FULL ATTN ON THE SECOND APCH AS I FOUND MYSELF COMPARING IT TO THE FIRST RATHER THAN STARTING WITH A CLEAN SLATE.

I WAS INITIATING A GAR; UPON ADVANCING THE THROTTLES THE R ENG DID NOT RESPOND IMMEDIATELY AND THE ACFT ROLLED OFF TO THE R. I RAISED MY FLAPS AND GEAR WHEN I FELT THE ACFT SINK. AT THIS POINT I WAS BEHIND THE PWR CURVE; LOW ALT; LOW AIRSPD; AND HIGH ANGLE OF ATTACK. OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE I SPOTTED A SMALL BODY OF WATER. IT BEING THE LOWEST POINT IN THE AREA I INSTINCTIVELY TURNED TOWARDS IT; LOWERED THE NOSE TO BUILD AIRSPD. AS I APCHED THE CTR OF THE LAKE I HAD REGAINED CTL OF THE ACFT AND PICKED UP ENOUGH SPD TO START MY CLB BACK TO TFC PATTERN ALT; BUT MAY HAVE DSNDED LOWER THAN 500 FT AGL PRIOR TO INITIATING THE CLB. THE MAIN CAUSE LEADING UP TO THIS EVENT WAS ALLOWING THE ACFT TO LOSE TOO MUCH AIRSPD PRIOR TO THE FLAREOUT AND NOT FLYING OVER THE RWY TO CHK FOR ANIMALS OR OBSTRUCTIONS PRIOR TO LNDG. ALSO RETRACTING FULL FLAPS PRIOR TO POSITIVE RATE OF CLB MADE THE ACFT SINK. UPON DISCUSSING THIS SIT WITH SOME HIGHLY EXPERIENCED CESSNA 310 PLTS; I LEARNED THAT RAISING THE GEAR AT SUCH HIGH ANGLE OF ATTACK A BURBLE OR VORTEX IS CREATED BY THE LARGE GEAR DOORS WHICH WILL CREATE A STALL OR BUFFETING OF THE ELEVATOR.

I WAS TRAVELING UP THE W SIDE OF THE PORTLAND METROPOLITAN AREA AT 4500 FT. AS I NEARED THE CLASS C AIRSPACE THAT SURROUNDS PDX I TRIED MULTIPLE TIMES TO ATTAIN FLT FOLLOWING FROM PORTLAND APCH. I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBLY BEING IN CONFLICT WITH THE ARRIVING ACFT INTO PDX EVEN THOUGH I WAS OUTSIDE; AND ABOVE THE CLASS C AIRSPACE. AFTER FINALLY REACHING THE CTLR AND RECEIVING A FREQ CHANGE I GAVE UP AND SIMPLY DECIDED TO DIVE UNDER THE PROTECTED AIRSPACE SINCE THE MODE C RPTING CAPABILITY OF THE XPONDER HAD BEEN INTERMITTENT. AT THIS POINT IT SHOULD BE SAID THAT; AFTER PORING OVER APCH PLATES FOR THE ILS TO RWY 10R APCH AND THE SEATTLE SECTIONAL CHART; IT IS MY BELIEF THAT AT NO TIME DID I ENTER THE CLASS C AIRSPACE OR PRESENT A CONFLICT. THE ALT SHOWN FOR THE NORTHWESTERN FLOOR OF THE CLASS C AIRSPACE IS 1800 FT. BY THE TIME I WAS DIRECTLY OFF THE APCH END OF RWY 10R I WAS THROUGH 1600 FT FOR 1500 FT. OFF MY L WING I SAW AND TRACKED AN ACR JET TURNING ONTO THE FINAL APCH COURSE. THE CTLR CALLED TFC FOR THE JET AT THEIR 2 O'CLOCK POS; NBOUND; ALT UNKNOWN. THE RESPONSE FROM THE ACR CREW WAS THAT THEY HAD THE TFC IN SIGHT AND IT APPEARED TO THEM THAT THE TFC WAS CUTTING RIGHT ACROSS THE FINAL APCH PATH AT GS INTERCEPT. THE GS INTERCEPT IS AT 2010 FT; 500 FT ABOVE MY INDICATED ALT. AT NO TIME DID EITHER OF US TAKE ACTION IN REGARD TO OUR RELATIVE POS. THE NEXT SERIES OF COMMENTS IS A BIT CONFUSING; AND I NOW IN REFLECTION BELIEVE THAT I MAY HAVE NOT BEEN THE ACFT IN CONFLICT. AFTER WATCHING THE JET PASS OVERHEAD; THE CREW STATED THAT THE TFC HAD BEEN A DEFINITE CONFLICT AND APPEARED TO BE A PIPER. FURTHERMORE THERE WAS A STRING OF REMARKS REGARDING THE FACT THAT THE ACFT SHOULD BE FOLLOWED AND THE PLT CONFRONTED. MY EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE ARE BY NO MEANS BOUNDLESS; HOWEVER; I FAIL TO SEE HOW A VERY DISTINCTIVE AIRPLANE LIKE AN OLD; STRAIGHT TAIL TWIN CESSNA LOOKS ANYTHING LIKE ANY PIPER I'VE EVER SEEN. I SUPPOSE IN REFLECTION THERE WERE OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO BOTH THE ACR CREW AND MYSELF. FOR MY PART; KNOWING THE INTERMEDIATE ALTS FOR THE ILS FINAL APCH WOULD HAVE TOLD ME THAT STAYING HIGH WOULD HAVE PUT ME IN LESS DANGER OF CONFRONTING A BIGGER; FASTER ACFT. ADDITIONALLY IF I HAD STAYED PERSISTENT AT TRYING TO GET ON WITH PORTLAND APCH EVERYONE WOULD HAVE KNOWN WHO; WHERE; AND WHAT I WAS. THE REACTION OF THE ACR CREW IS TYPICAL; AND UNFORTUNATE. I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE THE RADAR TRACK OF BOTH ACFT; AS WELL AS KNOW FOR SURE IF IT WAS REALLY ME THEY WERE LOOKING AT. MY HOME BASE IS VERY CLOSE TO PDX AND MY COURSE AFTER THE INCIDENT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY EASY TO FOLLOW ON RADAR.

ATIS WAS CURRENT WITH THE WARNING THAT THE RWYS WERE COVERED WITH 1/2 INCH OF SNOW AND PATCHY ICE. CLR WITH 20-30 MI VISIBILITY. HOWEVER; THE BRIGHT SUN WITH THE SNOW COVER OBSCURED MANY OBJECTS ON THE GND. MY PLANE WAS ON IFR FLT PLAN FROM IXD TO APA. I WAS UNABLE TO VISUALLY IDENT THE ARPT UNTIL I WAS APPROX 5 NM E OF THE ARPT AT WHICH TIME I WAS CLRED FOR VISUAL TO RWY 17L AND SWITCHED TO TWR FREQ. SHORTLY AFTERWARD; I TURNED R FOR A L DOWNWIND TO RWY 17L. TWR RPTED A CHEYENNE INBOUND FROM THE N AT THE N EDGE OF A LAKE JUST N OF THE ARPT. THE CHEYENNE WAS INBOUND TO RWY 17R. AS I RECALL BOTH MY PLANE AND THE CHEYENNE WERE INSTRUCTED TO LOOK FOR THE OTHER; BUT NEITHER WAS ABLE TO ESTABLISH VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE OTHER ACFT. I TURNED TO L BASE DURING THIS; ABOUT 2 MI NE OF THE ARPT; STILL UNABLE TO ESTABLISH VISUAL OF THE OTHER ACFT. SHORTLY AFTER MY TURN TO BASE; THE TWR INSTRUCTED ME TO TURN STRAIGHT TO THE RWY. I DID SO; ENDING WITH A SHORT FINAL. THE STRUCTURE THAT I IDENTED AS THE RWY WAS MOSTLY COVERED WITH SNOW WITH EXCEPTION OF PATCHY AREAS OF VISIBLE ASPHALT IN THE CENTRAL 1/3. 2 PLANES WERE SITTING TO THE L OF THE APCH END APPEARING TO ME TO BE HOLDING IN THE NORMAL POS TO TAXI ONTO THE RWY. MY LNDG OCCURRED UNEVENTFULLY UNTIL I CAME TO A STOP AT THE END OF WHAT I COULD IDENT AS RWY (THE REST WAS COMPLETELY SNOW COVERED). AT THAT TIME THE TWR INFORMED ME THAT I WAS ON THE TXWY. FACTORS: 1) POOR VISIBILITY OF GND OBJECTS WITH SNOW OBSCURING MANY CRITICAL VISUAL CUES. 2) PLT UNFAMILIARITY WITH ARPT (EVEN THOUGH PROPER CHARTS WERE PRESENT AND HAD BEEN STUDIED). 3) NO INST APCH FOR APCHS TO THE S. 4) POTENTIAL CONFLICTING TFC WITH NEITHER PLT ABLE TO ESTABLISH VISUAL CONTACT WITH OTHER. 5) INSTRUCTION TO FLY DIRECT TO THE RWY RATHER THAN A MORE STANDARD PATTERN. (IF THERE WAS CONCERN ABOUT THE POTENTIAL CONFLICT IN THE CTLR'S MIND; A TURN TO A LONGER DOWNWIND MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BETTER ALTERNATIVE). BOTTOM LINE: GIVEN THE CLR WX AND CURRENT CONDITIONS IT IS QUESTIONABLE THAT THE CTLR COULD FORESEE THE VISUAL DIFFICULTY THAT A PLT MIGHT HAVE. WITH THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED; I IDENTED WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE RWY AND NEVER DOUBTED THAT THE STRUCTURE IDENTED THROUGH THE SNOW WAS THE RWY.

AT THE TIME OF DEP; WX CONDITIONS IN THE DALLAS AREA WERE RPTED VFR. AT THE DEST; THE WX WAS MARGINAL VFR/IFR WITH A RAPID IMPROVING TREND. AT ABILENE; THE WX WAS STILL IFR DUE TO A LOW TEMP/DEWPOINT SPREAD. AT APPROX 100 NM FROM SJT; I EXPERIENCED A DECREASE IN FUEL PRESSURE ON THE R ENG WHICH RESULTED IN A PARTIAL LOSS IN PWR.

WE CALLED ARPT IN SIGHT AND WERE CLRED FOR THE VISUAL APCH TO RWY 30. AT THIS POINT WE WERE POSITIONED APPROX 1 NM FROM THE APCH END OF RWY 30; SLIGHTLY L OF CTRLINE AND HEADED 090 DEGS. WE SHOT THROUGH THE RWY 30 FINAL AND CONTINUED EBOUND IN AN ATTEMPT TO LOSE ALT TO COMPLETE A NORMAL APCH AND LNDG.

WHEN WE WERE CLRED FOR THE APCH WE WERE ABOUT 1 NM FROM THE END OF RWY 30 AND HAD 2150 FT TO LOSE. THIS MADE THE APCH IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT SOME ADDITIONAL MANEUVERING.

ON THE SECOND APCH; WE WERE VECTORED TO ABOUT THE SAME POS AND WERE AT 1500 FT AND STILL HAD TO MAKE A STEEPER THAN NORMAL APCH TO RWY 30. I BELIEVE THAT A PROB EXISTS IN THE MANNER IN WHICH CAPITAL CITY IS SETTING UP AND ISSUING VISUAL APCHS.

THE SUN WAS STARTING TO SET TO THE W WHICH MADE IT DIFFICULT TO SEE ANY POSSIBLE TFC TO THE W (TFC ON RWY 9R/L). WE PROCEEDED TO LAND ON RWY 13; TOUCHED DOWN AND SLOWED THE AIRPLANE TO A FAST PACE TAXI SPD. SINCE WE WERE PAST THE FIRST FEW TXWYS; I DECIDED TO TAXI THE ACFT ACROSS RWY 9L TO THE NEXT TXWY BEFORE WE MADE A R TURN. BY THIS TIME THE ACFT IS AT A SLOW PACE TAXI SPD. IT IS AT THIS POINT THAT TWR CALLS A CERTAIN ACFT WITH A 'HOLD SHORT' INSTRUCTION. THERE WAS NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT. TWR ONCE AGAIN INSTRUCTED THAT ACFT TO HOLD SHORT; STILL NO REPLY. BY THAT TIME I STARTED TO LOOK AROUND AT THE OTHER RWYS WITHOUT SEEING ANYTHING THREATENING. THE SAME CTLR APPARENTLY CLICKED HIS MIKE. THERE WERE OTHER VOICES IN THE BACKGROUND (OTHER CTLRS) THAT WERE YELLING 'HE'S GOT TO STOP;' 'STOP' NEVER GIVING A CALL SIGN. I ONCE AGAIN TURNED TO MY R; AND TO MY SHOCKED SURPRISE SAW A B737 DEPARTING ON RWY 9L. AT THE SAME TIME THE TWR CTLR; POSSIBLY A DIFFERENT CTLR; INSTRUCTED US TO HOLD SHORT IMMEDIATELY.

TWR THEN INSTRUCTED US TO TURN R AT THE NEXT TXWY AND TO CONTACT GND WHICH WE DID. STILL MONITORING GND JUST BEFORE SHUTDOWN; I HEARD THE B737 PLT ASKING FOR AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHAT HAD JUST HAPPENED. THE GND CTLR STATED THAT THE ACFT THAT LANDED ON RWY 13 WAS ISSUED A LAND AND HOLD SHORT CLRNC. THIS WAS NOT THE CASE. THERE WAS NO HOLD SHORT RESTR WHATSOEVER. I MADE SURE THAT THIS WAS UNDERSTOOD BY THE GND CTLR. I WAS GIVEN A TELEPHONE NUMBER FOR THE TWR AFTERWARDS.

HOWEVER; TO MY SURPRISE; ATC CHANGED THEIR STORY. THE SUPVR INDICATED THAT THERE WAS TRAINING GOING ON IN THE TWR AND THAT THE TRAINEE INFORMED HIM OF THE OCCURRENCE IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS. HE ADMITTED THAT THERE WAS NEVER A HOLD SHORT RESTR ISSUED TO ME. I THINK THAT IT IS VERY CLR THAT BOTH PLTS AND CTLRS NEVER STOP LEARNING. HOWEVER; IT IS ALSO CLR THAT THIS LEARNING PROCESS AND ESPECIALLY THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT MUST ALWAYS BE AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE. SAFETY AND SUPERVISION IN THIS TRAINING ENVIRONMENT WERE NEGLECTED.

A FLT PLAN WAS FILED FOR 3KM DIRECT HYS AT 8000 FT; 45 MINS ENRTE. THE AIRPLANE WAS RETRIEVED FROM THE HANGAR AND WAS PREFLTED. NO ABNORMALITIES WERE IDENTED (SPECIFICALLY BOTH THE L AND R ALTERNATOR BELTS WERE PRESENT AND NORMAL). THE ACFT WAS STARTED AND THE PREFLT CHKLIST WAS COMPLETED. ALL SYS WERE FUNCTIONING NORMALLY. AN IFR CLRNC WAS OBTAINED AND THE AIRPLANE DEPARTED 3KM. THE DEP AND INITIAL CLB PHASES WERE UNEVENTFUL AND I WAS CLRED ON COURSE (300 DEGS) AND UP TO 8000 FT MSL. THE FIRST 20 MINS OF THE FLT WERE NORMAL. WHILE CLBING THROUGH 6000 FT MSL THE R ALTERNATOR FAILURE LIGHT CAME ON. THE L ALTERNATOR WAS OPERATING NORMALLY AS INDICATED BY BOTH THE VOLTMETER AND NON LIGHTED L ALTERNATOR FAILURE LIGHT. AS THE ACFT WAS IMC; INITIAL ACTION OF DECREASING THE ELECTRICAL LOAD WAS ACCOMPLISHED. THE PITOT HEAT AND CABIN HEATER WERE MAINTAINED IN THE 'ON' POS AS THE OUTSIDE AIR TEMP INDICATED 35 DEGS. AFTER LEVELING AND TRIMMING THE AIRPLANE AT 8000 FT MSL; THE PROC LIST WAS CONSULTED. THE R ALTERNATOR DID NOT REGAIN FUNCTION AND THE R FAILURE LIGHT CONTINUED TO BE LIGHTED. DURING THE PROC IT WAS NOTED THAT THE R ALTERNATOR CIRCUIT BREAKER WAS OPEN. THE R ALTERNATOR WAS SELECTED 'OFF;' 2 MINS WERE ALLOWED FOR COOLING AND THE CIRCUIT BREAKER WAS RESET AND THE R ALTERNATOR WAS SELECTED TO THE 'ON' POS. THE PANEL LIGHTS TRANSIENTLY DIMMED AND THE R ALTERNATOR FAILURE LIGHT DID NOT GO OUT. THE L ALTERNATOR APPEARED TO REMAIN FUNCTIONAL AS THE L FAILURE LIGHT CAME ON DURING; BUT WENT OUT AFTER; THE ATTEMPT TO RESET THE R ALTERNATOR. APPROX 10-15 MINS AFTER THIS STRING OF EVENTS STARTED IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE ELECTRICAL SYS WAS NOT OPERATING AS EXPECTED. ALTHOUGH THE L ALTERNATOR FAILURE LIGHT WAS NOT ON; IT WAS SUSPECTED THAT THE SYS WAS NOT CHARGING THE BATTERY. THE PUSH TO TEST SHOWED THAT THE L ALTERNATOR FAILURE LIGHT WAS NOT BURNED OUT. THE CIRCUIT BREAKERS WERE RE- INSPECTED AND IT WAS FOUND THAT BOTH THE R AND L ALTERNATOR CIRCUIT BREAKERS WERE NOW OPEN. AN EMER WAS DECLARED TO ZKC. RADIO CONTACT WAS POOR AT BEST. AN INITIAL TURN TOWARDS SLN WAS STARTED FROM THE HYS 120 DEG RADIAL AT ABOUT 50 NM. BOTH ALTERNATORS WERE SELECTED 'OFF;' ALLOWED TO COOL. IT WAS FOUND THAT NEITHER CIRCUIT BREAKERS WOULD RESET. AS THERE WERE SEVERAL ARPTS IN THE NEAR AND ADJACENT AREAS THE LNDG GEAR WERE EXTENDED. AS IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE COM/NAV RADIOS WERE FAILED I DECIDED TO RE-EVALUATE THE SIT; OPTIONS AND PLAN AN ACTION. THE WICHITA VFR SECTIONAL MAP WAS ALSO OPENED AND CONFIRMED THAT WHILE GREAT BEND GBD AND HUTCHINSON HUT ARPTS WERE NEAR; THERE WERE TOO MANY TALL RADIO TWRS NEAR THEM TO ATTEMPT TO GO THERE. LYONS LYO WAS VERY CLOSE BUT HAD 6 RADIO TWRS NEAR THE ARPT. TO CONTINUE TOWARDS SLN WAS NOT A GOOD CHOICE AS BOTH RESTR AREAS R3601A AND B WERE BTWN THE CURRENT POS AND SLN. 9K7 WAS THE BEST OPTION. IT WAS ALMOST DUE N OF THE CURRENT POS AND ONLY 23 MI AWAY. I HAD BEEN INTO THE ARPT MANY TIMES AND WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE LCL TERRAIN. THE RWY IS ALMOST 4000 FT LONG AND THE S END LINES UP WITH A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY THAT HAS NUMEROUS VERY HIGH INTENSITY LIGHTS THAT ARE BRIGHT ORANGE AND VISIBLE FROM MANY MI AWAY. AS I CROSSED OVER WHAT I BELIEVED TO BE LYONS LYO THE DIFFUSE GLOW OF LIGHT COULD BE SEEN THROUGH THE CLOUDS. A GARMIN GPS 95 XL WAS TURNED ON AND CONFIRMED THE CURRENT POS AND GND SPD AND HEADING AND DISTANCE TO 9K7. THE GPS HAD BEEN LOANED TO ANOTHER PLT THE DAY BEFORE AND HAD VERY LOW BATTERIES AND WAS EXPECTED TO WORK FOR ONLY A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AT BEST. A STABILIZED DSCNT OF 400-500 FPM WAS ESTABLISHED THAT ALLOWED THE AIRPLANE TO BE AT 2500 FT MSL WHEN AT A DISTANCE OF ABOUT 3 MI SSE OF 9K7. THE SECTIONAL CHART INDICATED THE MAX ELEVATION FIGURE TO BE 2300 FT MSL NEAR 9K7. THE CITY OF ELLSWORTH AND THE PRISON LIGHTS WERE VISIBLE AS THE AIRPLANE CROSSED THE NAV POINT AND A VISUAL APCH AND LNDG WERE MADE IN VFR CONDITIONS FROM THAT NAV POINT. THE MECH HAS STARTED INSPECTING THE SYS AND SO FAR HAS FOUND THAT THE R ALTERNATOR BELT BROKE. THE L ALTERNATOR CIRCUIT BREAKER OPENS AT ABOUT 1/10 THE INTENDED CURRENT FLOW AND WILL NOT RESET UNTIL THE R SIDE IS OPERATING NORMAL.

ABOUT 10 MINS FROM GCK; I TURNED ON THE HEATER. BTWN 2 AND 5 MINS LATER; WE NOTICED A STRANGE ACRID SMELL IN THE CABIN. IT SMELLED OF BURNING ELECTRICAL INSULATION. I HAD ALSO PULLED THE FORWARD CABIN AIR AND CABIN AIR KNOBS OUT. VERY SOON AFTER WE NOTICED THE SMELL; WE SAW SMOKE ENTER THE CABIN. I IMMEDIATELY TURNED THE HEATER OFF. WE TURNED AROUND AND BEGAN TO DSND. PLT TURNED OFF THE BATTERY AND GENERATOR SWITCHES AND THE SMOKE AND SMELL BEGAN TO SLOWLY DISAPPEAR. I THEN REALIZED THAT THE LNDG GEAR WAS ELECTRIC. SO I ASKED PLT TO TURN ON THE BATTERY MASTER TO SEE IF WE WOULD GET THE SMELL AND SMOKE AGAIN. HE DID SO AND WE GOT NO SMELL. SO WE DECIDED TO PUT THE LNDG GEAR DOWN TO GET IT OUT OF THE WAY. WHEN WE LOWERED THE LNDG GEAR; I FELT THE GEAR FALL OUT AND THE EXTENSION SEEMED TO BEGIN NORMALLY; THEN WE HEARD A STRANGE SOUND COME FROM THE GEAR MOTOR. IT WAS A HIGH PITCHED WHINE. WE DIDN'T GET A GREEN LIGHT. WE PUSHED BOTH THE RED AND GREEN LIGHTS TO SEE IF THEY WOULD LIGHT AND THEY DID. WE THEN AGREED THAT THE ELECTRICAL FAILURE SOMEHOW AFFECTED THE LNDG GEAR MOTOR. SO WE DECIDED TO EXTEND THE GEAR MANUALLY. MR X WENT THROUGH THE PROC BUT HE NEVER GOT A GREEN LIGHT AND NEVER FELT ANY RESISTANCE IN THE HANDLE. WHEN WE TURNED ON THE RADIO; WE GOT THE SMELL AND MORE SMOKE. WE TRIED PUTTING 7700 IN THE XPONDER AND WHEN WE TURNED IT ON; WE GOT THE SMELL AND MORE SMOKE. SO WE STOWED THE GEAR HANDLE; TURNED ON THE MASTER AND TRIED TO LOWER THE GEAR AGAIN. WE GOT THE HIGH PITCHED WHINE AGAIN AND SO MR X TURNED OFF THE MASTER SWITCH. HOWEVER; THE MOTOR DIDN'T STOP RUNNING. IT SEEMED TO CONTINUE AT A HIGHER AND HIGHER PITCH AND THEN IT STOPPED. THE OUTSIDE AIR TEMP GAUGE; THE FUEL QUANTITY INDICATORS AND CYLINDER HEAD TEMP WERE WORKING. MR X THEN NOTICED THAT THE FUEL GAUGES HAD CONDENSATION ON THE INSIDE OF THE GLASS. I TOUCHED THEM AND THEY WERE HOT TO THE TOUCH. SO WE DECIDED THAT THE GEAR DOWN GREEN LIGHT WAS NOT RELIABLE AND DECIDED TO TRY A REAL SOFTLNDG TO SEE IF THE GEAR WAS DOWN AND LOCKED. I CAME DOWN ON FINAL AT ABOUT 100 MPH IAS AND SETTLED GENTLY ONTO THE RWY. WE FELT THE GEAR TOUCH AND IT FELT SOLID. JUST AS I WAS ABOUT TO REDUCE PWR; THE R SIDE LNDG GEAR BEGAN TO COLLAPSE; I PUT IN FULL THROTTLE AND TOOK OFF. WE DECIDED TO READ THE FLT MANUAL AGAIN AND TRY TO GET A BETTER PICTURE OF THE GEAR SYS AND TRY THE EMER EXTENSION SYS AGAIN. I READ AND THEN PERFORMED THE PROC. AGAIN I FELT NO RESISTANCE TO THE EMER GEAR EXTENSION HANDLE. I PLACED THE GEAR HANDLE IN THE 'UP' POS. NOTHING HAPPENED. SO I PLACED IT BACK INTO THE NEUTRAL POS AND TRIED THE MANUAL EXTENSION AGAIN. WE THEN DECIDED TO 'BOUNCE THE LNDG GEAR ON THE RWY TO LOCK IT. THROUGHOUT OUR EFFORTS; THE ACRID SMELL WOULD COME AND GO AND THE FUEL GAUGES WERE STILL HOT TO THE TOUCH ADDING TO OUR URGENCY. WE DECIDED TO GO AHEAD AND LAND ON THE NEXT PASS. WE AGREED THAT IF THE PLANE STARTED TO FALL RIGHT AFTER TOUCHDOWN WE WOULD GO AROUND AGAIN AND IF IT ROLLED OUT OK; I WOULD KILL THE MIXTURES. WE CAME IN AT ABOUT 100 MPH IAS AND TOUCHED DOWN. ALL 3 WHEELS SUPPORTED THE AIRPLANE AND SO I PULLED THE MIXTURES. WE ROLLED ABOUT 500-1000 FT AND THEN THE R MAIN COLLAPSED TAKING THE L MAIN DOWN AND WE SLID ANOTHER 2000 FT AND SLID OFF THE RWY TO THE L SIDE. PROBABLY; THE GEAR WOULDN'T LOCK BECAUSE OF AIR LOADS ON THE NOSEWHEEL. WHEN THE R MAIN COLLAPSED; IT PULLED THE RODS TO THE OTHER 2 LNDG GEAR. THAT PULLED THE L MAIN UNDER. THE GEAR DIDN'T FOLD COMPLETELY UP INTO THE WELLS BECAUSE THE NOSEWHEEL WAS AT SUCH AN ANGLE THAT IT WOULDN'T FOLD BACK UNDER. THIS HELD THE RODS ON THE OTHER 2 WHEELS SO THEY STAYED PARTIALLY EXTENDED. I BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING IS BROKEN INSIDE THE GEAR TRANSMISSION. I BELIEVE THAT SOME PART OF THE HEATER ELECTRICS SHORTED. WE TALKED WITH FAA INSPECTOR OUT OF WICHITA. IT WOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS AN ACFT INCIDENT. THROUGHOUT WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT AN ELECTRICAL FIRE BECAUSE THE ELECTRICAL SHORT LEFT SOME EQUIP ON EVEN WITH THE BATTERY AND GENERATORS OFF. ALSO THE HOT FACES OF THE FUEL QUANTITY INDICATORS MADE US VERY NERVOUS. MR X ALSO THOUGHT HE SAW A SPARK WHEN HE TURNED THE XPONDER ON AND I THOUGHT I SAW A SPARK BEHIND THE PANEL. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 397326: MR Y TOOK THE CTLS AS I SLOWLY WENT THROUGH THE EMER GEAR EXTENSION PROC AS WRITTEN IN THE POH. I WAS DISMAYED TO FIND THERE WAS NO 'PRESSURE' ON THE EMER GEAR CRANK. I HAVE GONE THROUGH THE PROC MANY TIMES IN THE PAST IN ANOTHER 310 WITH STUDENTS (ONLY IN PRACTICE!) AND AM INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH THE PROC. AFTER CRANKING THE GEAR DOWN; THE CRANK SHOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE AS THE GEAR IS MOVED BY PUSH RODS. I ROTATED THE CRANK 90 TIMES (30 MORE THAN NORMAL) FEELING NO PRESSURE IN THE HANDLE AT ALL. MR Y CLBED INTO THE BACK TO ATTEMPT TO UNSCREW THE FLOORBOARDS AND INSPECT THE GEAR MECHANISM. HE SAW THAT THERE WERE MANY SCREWS TO UNDO AND WHILE HE WAS WORKING ON THE SECOND ONE I HEARD SEVERAL LOUD 'POPS' FROM THE INST PANEL AND SAW SOME MORE SMOKE. I CALLED MR Y UP FRONT AND WE DECIDED THE TIME HAD COME TO LAND. I AM REVIEWING OUR ACTIONS BUT AT PRESENT I AM HAPPY WITH OUR ACTIONS. I AM VERY GLAD WE COULD WORK AS A CREW AND WORK THROUGH THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE. IT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WE HAD CRASH ASSISTANCE BEFORE WE LANDED AND I WAS UPSET (PERHAPS IRRATIONALLY; GIVEN THE SIT) THAT THERE WAS NONE. ULTIMATELY A CFR TRUCK WOULD NOT HAVE CHANGED THE COURSE OF EVENTS DURING OUR LNDG; BUT IT WOULD HAVE PROVIDED ME SOME PEACE OF MIND. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO (AND LOOK FORWARD TO) TALK WITH SOMEONE TO FIGURE OUT HOW A CRASH TRUCK WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO SOMEONE IN A SIMILAR SIT IN THE FUTURE.",,,,"A C310 HAS MASSIVE ELECTRICAL PROBS CREATING SMOKE AND POSSIBLE FIRE.

AFTER DEPARTING RWY 30R; I APPLIED THE BRAKES AND RAISED THE LNDG GEAR LEVER TO THE UP POS. I HEARD THE GEAR MOTOR ENGAGE AND FELT THE USUAL VIBRATION AS THE GEAR WAS RETRACTING. HOWEVER; I NOTICED THAT THE L MAIN GEAR INDICATOR LIGHT WAS STILL ILLUMINATED; INDICATING A DOWN AND LOCKED CONDITION. AT THIS POINT; I MADE SURE I WAS STILL BELOW THE LNDG GEAR MAX OPERATING SPD AND MOVED THE GEAR LEVER TO THE DOWN POS AGAIN. I FELT THE GEAR MOTOR ENGAGE AND THE NOSEWHEEL AND R MAIN WHEEL INDICATORS ILLUMINATED; GIVING ME AN INDICATION THAT ALL WHEELS WERE DOWN AND LOCKED. I TRIED AGAIN TO RAISE THE GEAR WITH THE SAME EFFECT. THE NOSEWHEEL AND R MAIN GEAR LIGHTS WENT OUT WHILE THE L MAIN STILL GAVE ME A DOWN AND LOCKED INDICATION. I LOWERED THE GEAR AGAIN AND GOT A POSITIVE INDICATION THAT ALL 3 WHEELS WERE DOWN AND LOCKED. THE LNDG WAS SMOOTH AND UNEVENTFUL. THE LNDG GEAR FELT STURDY AND I HAD NO INDICATION THAT THERE WAS A PROB ON THE GND. I ALLOWED THE AIRPLANE TO ROLL THE LENGTH OF THE RWY USING MINIMAL BRAKING TO REDUCE THE EXTRA LOAD ON THE LNDG GEAR. THE PLANE CAME TO A STOP AT THE FAR END OF THE RWY. I BEGAN TO MAKE A L 180 DEG TURN TO BACK TAXI WHEN I HEARD A METALLIC GROANING NOISE. THE PLANE BEGAN TO SHIFT TO THE R; THEN TILT TO THE L. I HEARD THE LNDG GEAR WARNING HORN BEGIN TO SOUND AND I ALSO HEARD THE PROP TIPS STRIKING THE RWY. I PULLED THE MIXTURE KNOBS IMMEDIATELY AND THE ENGS STOPPED. I TURNED OFF THE MAGNETOS; THE ALTERNATORS AND BATTERY. I THEN SWITCHED OFF THE FUEL TANKS. I SURVEYED THE VISIBLE DAMAGE. THE L MAIN LNDG GEAR ASSEMBLY HAD FOLDED OUTWARD (IT IS SUPPOSED TO RETRACT INWARD) AND THE L WING WAS RESTING ON THE RWY. THE PROP TIPS ON THE L ENG WERE BENT. WHEN THE MECHS BROUGHT THE AIRPLANE TO THE HANGAR THEY INSPECTED THE GEAR ASSEMBLY TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE. THEY FOUND THAT IT WAS A MECHANICAL DEFECT THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN DETECTED DURING A PREFLT INSPECTION OR EVEN DURING A ROUTINE 100 HR INSPECTION. IT WAS LATER DETERMINED THAT THE PIN HOLDING THE LNDG GEAR TO THE TRUNNION HAD COME LOOSE DUE TO THE SHEARING OF THE RETAINING PINS. THE RESULTING STRESS ON THE PIN CAUSED IT TO FAIL; WHICH ALLOWED THE LNDG GEAR TO COLLAPSE. I SPECULATE THAT A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE GEAR PIN IS THE CONDITION OF THE RWY AT 3SQ. IT IS QUITE BUMPY AND THE ACFT MAKES ANYWHERE FROM 10-20 LNDGS THERE PER WK. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR STATED THAT TO HIS KNOWLEDGE THERE WAS ONLY 1 OTHER SIMILAR INCIDENT OF THIS NATURE ON A C310. HIS INSTRUCTOR PLT MENTIONED THIS FACT TO HIM AFTER THIS INCIDENT HAD OCCURRED. RPTR AGREED THAT; HAD HE KNOWN BETTER AND HAD BEEN WARNED OF THIS POSSIBILITY; THAT HE WOULD HAVE SIMPLY SHUT THE ENGS DOWN AT THE END OF THE RWY AND HAD THE GEAR PINNED. OF THE 2 RETAINING PINS THAT HOLD THE GEAR TO THE TRUNNION; THE AFT ONE SHEARED; ALLOWING THE OTHER PIN TO BEND WHEN A SIDE LOAD WAS PLACED ON THE GEAR.

THE FLT CONTINUED TO DEST WITH NO FURTHER PROB. I FEEL THE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THIS OCCURRENCE WERE: 1) FAILURE OF THE CAPT TO ENSURE THE PF WAS AWARE OF THE ASSIGNED RWY HDG CLRNC BY TWR. 2) A FEELING OF IMPORTANCE TO ASSIST WITH CTR REQUEST CONVEYED BY LCL CTLRS TO HAVE MINIMUM DELAY. 3) WX CONDITIONS (UNLIMITED CEILING AND 10+ MI VISIBILITY) THAT DOWNPLAYED THE IMPORTANCE OF IFR CLRNC INSTRUCTIONS. 4) FAILURE OF THE CREW TO HAVE CONTINUALLY POSITIVE COM BTWN BOTH CREW MEMBERS.",,,,"FLC OF A C337 SUPER SKYMASTER FAILED TO FOLLOW RWY HDG AFTER INITIAL CLB RESULTING IN ARTCC RADAR CTLR INTERVENTION IN CONFIRMING THEIR ACTUAL CLRNC BY THE DEP TWR CTLR.",

AFTER PASSING RED BLUFF VOR WE CLBED TO 15500 FT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FAVORABLE WINDS FORECAST TO THE N AND TO GET ABOVE THE SMOKE THAT SEEMED TO BE RISING AHEAD WHERE THE TERRAIN AROUND SHASTA RISES. VISIBILITY DETERIORATED TO THE POINT THAT WE COULD BARELY SEE THE GND. IT WAS CLR THAT WE WOULD SOON BE IFR IF WE WERE NOT ALREADY. WE WERE WITH ZOA SO I CALLED IN AND ASKED FOR IFR CLRNC DIRECT TO HOOD RIVER WHICH WAS GRANTED AT 16000 FT. SHORTLY AFTER CLRNC WAS GRANTED WE TRANSITIONED FROM SMOKE TO CLOUDS AND STARTED TO PICK UP A THIN LAYER OF CLR ICE. THIS CONTINUED FOR ABOUT 8 MI WITH VERY LITTLE BUILDUP AND THEN WE HIT FREEZING RAIN AND SNOW. AT THE SAME TIME THE STORM SCOPE STARTED TO SHOW A LINE OF DISCHARGES DEAD AHEAD FOR 10-20 MI WHERE IT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ABSOLUTELY CLR. WITH ICE COLLECTING AT A NOTICEABLE RATE AND TSTMS AHEAD I RPTED ICING AND ASKED FOR A 60 DEG R TURN TO TAKE US TO THE E AROUND THE TSTMS AND TOWARDS WHAT WAS NORMALLY DRIER AIR. WITHIN MINS WE WERE GETTING STRONG UP AND DOWN DRAFTS THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN ALT AND IT BECAME CLR TO ME THAT WE COULD NOT AFFORD TO CONTINUE TO PICK UP ICE AND STAY IN THE AIR. I RPTED TO THE CTLR THAT WE WERE REVERSING COURSE BACK TO RED BLUFF BECAUSE OF ICE AND HE ASKED IF WE WANTED AN ALT CHANGE AS WELL. WE WERE GIVEN CLRNC TO CLB TO 18000 FT AND APPLIED FULL PWR BUT COULD NOT CLB AT 120 MPH WHICH I FELT WAS A MINIMUM SPD TO AVOID A STALL WITH 1/2 TO 3/4 OF AN INCH OF ICE. THE REAR ENG STARTED TO OVERHEAT (POSSIBLE LOW SPD NOSE UP FULL PWR ATTITUDE DID NOT PUSH ENOUGH AIR THROUGH THE REAR SCOOP AND ICE MAY HAVE SHUT DOWN SOME OF THE OPENING). WE WERE ALSO GETTING UNCOMMANDED ALT EXCURSIONS OF UP TO 1000 FT. I WAS LOADED UP WITH TASKS TRYING TO KEEP THE PLANE UPRIGHT; KEEP THE REAR ENG ALIVE AND HOLD A HEADING THAT WOULD TAKE US CLR OF THE STORM. AT ONE POINT I GLANCED AT THE ENG INSTS AND CAME BACK TO THE CTR OF MY SCAN TO FIND THE PLANE IN A 50 DEG R HAND BANK DSNDING AT 2000 FPM -- TURB OR MY ERROR I DON'T KNOW -- THIS WAS THE ONLY MOMENT THAT REALLY SCARED ME. THE CTLR CALLED AND ASKED WHY WE WERE NOT AT THE ASSIGNED ALT. I RESPONDED THAT WE WERE UNABLE TO CLB AND WOULD LIKE A DSCNT. HE REMINDED ME THAT WE WERE STILL IFR AND NEEDED TO COMPLY WITH ALT ASSIGNMENTS AND THEN CLRED US FOR A DSCNT TO 13000 FT. WE SOON WERE CLR OF THE CLOUDS AND STARTED TO SHED THE ICE AT ABOUT 14000 FT. A RETURN TO OUR ORIGINAL COURSE AT AN ALT OF 11000 FT PUT US THROUGH SOME RAIN AND SMOOTH AIR AND OUT THE OTHER SIDE IN HAZY SMOKE. A NUMBER OF THOUGHTS: 1) I SHOULD IMMEDIATELY HAVE TAKEN ACTION TO AVOID THE ICE WHEN IT FIRST APPEARED -- WITH AN OUTSIDE AIR TEMP OF ABOUT -2 DEGS C A REQUEST FOR 2000 FT LOWER WOULD HAVE PROBABLY DONE THE TRICK. WE ARE TAUGHT TO CLB AND THAT WAS MY IMMEDIATE REQUEST; BUT IF I HAD THOUGHT ABOUT IT I HAD ENOUGH DATA TO COME UP WITH A BETTER SOLUTION. PERHAPS THE CTLR COULD HAVE PASSED ON INFO ON FORECASTED OR RPTED FREEZING LEVELS. I WAS ALSO UNPREPARED FOR IFR CONDITIONS AND HAD NOT DONE MY NORMAL IFR PREFLT PLANNING. SATELLITE PHOTOS; DUATS AND PAST EXPERIENCE SUGGESTED IT WOULD BE IFR ALL THE WAY. HAD I BEEN PREPARED I WOULD PROBABLY HAVE ASKED FOR LOWER. THE LESSON HERE IS ALWAYS PREPARE FOR THE WORST; PLAN YOUR OPTIONS BEFORE YOU LAUNCH. 2) MY DECISION TO CHANGE COURSE 60 DEGS WAS CALCULATED TO GET US AROUND THE STORM BUT STILL KEEP SOME VECTOR IN THE DIRECTION WE WANTED TO GO; THIS IS STUPID. I FAILED TO CONFESS TO MYSELF THAT OUR FLT PLAN COULD NO LONGER BE EXECUTED. I AM A RATIONAL PERSON AND ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT I WOULD NOT GET CAUGHT IN THE EGO TRAP; BUT I DIDN'T TURN AROUND BECAUSE I HATE TO TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER. THIS IS A VALUABLE LESSON AND I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO TEACH IT AS I HAVE READ ABOUT IT A DOZEN TIMES YET I STILL WENT OUT AND TRIED TO BULL MY WAY THROUGH. 3) I SHOULD HAVE TOLD THE CTLR THAT I WAS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN ALT BUT I WAS SO LOADED UP WITH TASKS AVIATING AND NAVING THAT COMMUNICATING WAS LOW ON THE PRIORITY LIST. THE CLAUSE THAT ALLOWS PLTS TO TAKE THE ACTION THEY FEEL IS REQUIRED TO GET OUT OF A JAMB WITHOUT SEVERE PENALTIES IS VERY IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN -- IT ALLOWED ME TO TAKE THE ACTION I NEEDED TO WITHOUT FIRST GETTING PERMISSION. NEXT TIME I WILL SIMPLY KEY THE MIKE AND RPT I CAN'T HOLD ALT AS I AM SORTING OUT THE FLYING.",,,,"A CESSNA SKYMASTER PLT FLEW INTO ICING CONDITIONS AND WAS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN ASSIGNED ALT NEAR RBL.",

THE IMPETUS TO CONTINUE ACROSS THE RWY WAS THE ADDITIONAL TIME WHICH WOULD BE REQUIRED TO WALK BACK TO THE TANKER BASE AND ARRANGE FOR A RIDE ON THE ARPT PERIMETER ROAD. THERE WERE SIGNS AT THE RWY EDGE THAT ADVISED XING OF THE ACTIVE RWY WAS NOT PERMITTED. IT APPEARS THAT THIS HAS BEEN A CONTINUING PROB FOR PERSONS ON THE GND TRYING TO GET BACK AND FORTH TO ACFT FROM THE VARIOUS FACILITIES ON THE JEFFCO ARPT AS THERE WAS A NEED TO POST SIGNS. WE WERE INTERCEPTED AS WE CONTINUED TOWARD OUR ACFT ON THE E SIDE OF RWY 20 BY THE COUNTY ARPT PERSONNEL. THEY INFORMED US WE HAD INAPPROPRIATELY CROSSED THE RWY AND THE TWR WAS UPSET. TO HELP ALLEVIATE THIS PROB IN THE FUTURE; I WOULD SUGGEST A XING POINT WHICH HAD A TELEPHONE OR RADIO TO THE TWR FOR PERMISSION TO CROSS TO THE E PORTION OF THE RAMP AREA. SECONDLY; I HAVE DECIDED TO CARRY MY PORTABLE VHF TRANSCEIVER FOR GND COM WHILE ON A CTLED ARPT RAMP AS A PEDESTRIAN. UNTIL COM TO TWR HAPPENS; ADDITIONALLY; A SIGN FURTHER UP THE W RAMP WHICH MADE CLR THAT PEDESTRIAN TFC ACROSS THE CROSS RWY WAS NOT AUTHORIZED WOULD REDUCE THE HUMAN FACTOR OF DESIRE; WHICH MOTIVATES ONE TO CONTINUE THE LAST 100-200 YARDS TO THEIR ACFT.",,,,"FIRE SUPPRESSION CREW WALKED ACROSS A RWY AT BJC.",

LIMITED VISIBILITIES EXISTED IN THE AREA; WHICH NECESSITATED THE USE OF THE APCH; ALTHOUGH NO REAL CEILING EXISTED. APPROX 5 MI FROM THE JOLIET VOR (JOT); I WAS INSTRUCTED BY CHICAGO APCH TO MAINTAIN 3000 FT UNTIL ESTABLISHED AND WAS CLRED FOR THE VOR 33 APCH INTO AURORA. I READ THE CLRNC BACK; LOCATED THE APCH PLATE FOR VOR 33 AND BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR THE APCH. HOWEVER; BY THE TIME I COMPLETED THE PREPARATION FOR THE APCH; I WAS APPROX 4 MI PAST THE JOLIET VOR. I IMMEDIATELY BEGAN MY DSCNT FROM MY LAST ASSIGNED ALT OF 4000 FT MSL TO THE INITIAL APCH ALT OF 3000 FT MSL AND TURNED BACK TOWARD THE FINAL APCH COURSE OF 330 DEGS FROM THE JOT VOR. SHORTLY AFTER BEGINNING MY DSCNT AND TURN TO THE APCH COURSE; I WAS CONTACTED BY CHICAGO APCH ABOUT MY LOCATION ON THE APCH COURSE AND ALT. I ACKNOWLEDGED MY OVERSHOOT OF THE APCH COURSE AND NOTIFIED THEM THAT I WAS TURNING BACK TO INTERCEPT THE APCH COURSE AND DSNDING TO 3000 FT MSL. AT THAT TIME; I WAS ASSIGNED A 010 DEG HDG TO INTERCEPT THE APCH COURSE AND WAS AGAIN CLRED FOR THE VOR 33 APCH INTO AURORA. UPON INTERCEPTING THE LOC COURSE; I CONTINUED MY DSCNT PER THE PUBLISHED APCH PROC AND WAS PASSED TO THE AURORA TWR. THE APCH TERMINATED WITH A VISUAL CIRCLING APCH TO RWY 15 FOR A FULL-STOP LNDG. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS IN THIS EVENT WERE INADEQUATE PREPARATION TIME AND RELATIVELY LOW TIME IN TYPE. IN A TWIN-ENG ACFT; OPERATING SINGLE-PLT; THINGS HAPPEN VERY QUICKLY. I DID NOT REACT AND PREPARE FOR THE APCH QUICKLY ENOUGH TO BEGIN THE ASSIGNED APCH BEFORE THE OVERSHOOT. ADDITIONALLY; I WAS NOT ALLOWED ADEQUATE TIME TO PREPARE FOR THE APCH. AT MY 180 KT GND SPD; I HAD APPROX 2 MINS TO PREPARE FOR THE APCH. THESE 2 MAIN CAUSES LEAD TO THE OVERSHOOT OF THE FINAL APCH COURSE. FORTUNATELY; THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE DANGER AND THE APCH TERMINATED WITHOUT INCIDENT; BUT THE POSSIBILITY FOR IMMEDIATE DANGER EXISTED. NORMALLY; ATC ALLOWS ADEQUATE TIME TO PREPARE WHEN A PLT SHOULD EXPECT A PARTICULAR INST APCH PROC. HOWEVER; IN THIS SIT; I WAS NOT GIVEN ENOUGH TIME FOR SEVERAL REASONS. FIRST; IN NORMAL INST METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS (IMC); PLTS EXPECT TO EXECUTE INST APCH PROCS. AS SUCH; THEY ARE MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY PREPARED FOR THE APCH; OFTEN BEFORE THEY ARE TOLD TO EXPECT A PARTICULAR APCH. IN THIS SIT; WX WAS MARGINAL VISUAL CONDITIONS; SO I EXPECTED RADAR VECTORS TO OBTAIN A VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE ARPT AND EXECUTE A VISUAL APCH INTO AURORA. THIS MAY HAVE BEEN A BAD ASSUMPTION ON MY PART; AND BETTER PREPAREDNESS WOULD HAVE AVOIDED THE SIT. WHEN I WAS CLRED FOR THE VOR 33 APCH; I NEEDED TIME TO SLOW THE ACFT; FIND THE APCH PROC CHART; CONFIGURE THE ACFT; DSND; SET UP THE RADIOS; AND INTERCEPT THE APCH COURSE. ALL THIS NEEDED TO HAPPEN WITHIN ABOUT 2 MINS. THE SOLUTION FOR THIS PROB MAY LIE WITH EARLIER NOTIFICATION OF THE TYPE OF APCH TO BE EXPECTED; EVEN WHEN IN VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY; MORE TRAINING AND MORE TIME IN TYPE WILL ALLOW ME TO REACT IN A TIMELIER MANNER TO SUDDEN CHANGES IN FLT PLAN; SUCH AS THIS SIT.

MY MISSION WAS FLYING AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY AT 2900 FT OVER DISNEY WORLD. I HAD FILED AN INST FLT PLAN WITH FSS PRIOR TO MY CLRNC FOR MY MISSION. PRIOR TO CLRNC; I SPOKE WITH MR X AT ORL APCH CTL. AFTER THE MISSION; I RETURNED TO MY DEST AT KISSIMMEE ARPT. THE CTLR TOLD ME TO CONTACT THE TWR WHEN I HAD THE FIELD IN VIEW AND EXPECT A VFR APCH. AT THIS TIME I WAS DSNDING AND DOING MY GUMPS AND GETTING READY TO MAKE MY VISUAL APCH. I CALLED THE TWR AND RPTED THAT I WAS INBOUND FOR A VISUAL TO RWY 6 (5000 FT LONG); HE REPLIED WITH SOP; 'RPT 2 MI OUT FROM RWY.' MY ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS AT THIS TIME CAUGHT THE NEXT XMISSION; WHICH WAS 'WARRIOR; ABANDON THE OPTION. I HAVE ANOTHER PLANE TO GET IN HERE.' WARRIOR WAS ON AN INST CHK RIDE BY A DESIGNATED INSTRUCTOR; DOING AN INST APCH TO RWY 6 FOR AN INST RATING (SEE DIAGRAM A AND B). I WAS PROCEEDING SE TO THE APCH END OF RWY 6; IN A LOW WING ACFT. I HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN ANY INSTRUCTIONS TO SQUARE OFF AND RPT A BASE LEG; OR THAT I WAS #2 TO LAND. WARRIOR WAS NOW APCHING THE MDA AND I WAS NOT ADVISED OF HIS LOCATION. STILL BEING ON AN INST FLT PLAN; I WAS PREPARING TO MAKE MY TURN; WHEN MY CAMERAMAN; MY ONLY PAX; WAS ALARMED AT SEEING A PLANE FROM HIS SEAT IN THE R REAR; AND SHOUTED; 'DO YOU SEE THIS PLANE? DO SOMETHING!' AT THIS POINT I WAS WHEELS DOWN; FULL FLAPS; AT BLUE LINE (110 KTS). AT THIS VERY MOMENT THE TWR URGENTLY INSTRUCTED WARRIOR TO BREAK R AT ONCE. WARRIOR BROKE R. I WAS PREPARING TO BREAK L TO PUT DISTANCE BTWN US RAPIDLY. WITHIN SECONDS WARRIOR HAD TURNED ABOUT 45 DEGS FROM RWY 6 AND WAS FLYING SE. AT THIS TIME I ESTIMATE THAT I WAS 250 FT HIGHER AND 1000 FT FROM 'WARRIOR.' I KEYED MY MIKE AND SAID 'THANK YOU WARRIOR.' THEN I TURNED TO 060 DEGS AND CONTINUED ON A SHORT FIELD LNDG. UPON TURNING OFF THE ACTIVE RWY; I WENT TO GND CTL AND REQUESTED MY 'TAXI TO YYY FBO.' THIS WAS OK'ED AND THE TWR INSTRUCTED ME TO CALL THE TWR ON DEPLANING. THIS I DID; AND I WAS ASKED BY THE TWR CHIEF WHAT MY STATEMENT WAS AS TO WHAT HAD OCCURRED. THIS WE DISCUSSED AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1) THE SEPTEMBER TRAGEDY. BIG CHANGES OCCURRED THEREAFTER! 2) VFR TFC HAD JUST BEEN RELEASED INTO THE AIRSPACE; HAVING BEEN GNDED FOR 2 WKS. 3) THERE ARE 2 LARGE FLT SCHOOLS AT KISSIMMEE ARPT. 4) I HAD MY INST CLRNC UNDER AN IFR CLRNC; AND DID NOT EXPECT A VFR PLANE IN THE APCH SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH MY ACFT. 5) WARRIOR'S PIC WAS IN THE R SEAT AND THE CHK RIDE PLT UNDOUBTEDLY IN THE L SEAT WEARING A HOOD OR FOGGLES. 6) THE WARRIOR PLT COULD NOT SEE TO THE L; AND I COULD NOT SEE TO THE R BECAUSE MY PLANE IS LOW WINGED. 7) A COLLISION WAS AVOIDED BY PROMPT TWR INSTRUCTIONS; AND FOLLOW THROUGH BY PIC OF WARRIOR.",,,,"A SYS ERROR OCCURS WHEN ATC FAILS TO SEPARATE 2 ACFT FOR AN APCH TO THE SAME RWY AT ISM; FL.",

(I WAS NOW THROUGH THE FINAL APCH COURSE FOR RWY 5L BECAUSE AFTER I TURNED TO AVOID TFC; I TURNED BACK TO 140 DEGS AFTER IT PASSED. I THINK THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS OCCURRENCE. THE FIRST WAS THAT WHILE INBOUND; I WAS INFORMED THAT THE MODE C PORTION OF MY XPONDER SYS WAS INDICATING INCORRECTLY. I ASSUME THAT THE INBOUND TFC I AVOIDED ON THE APCH TO RWY 5L HAD TCASII AND I AM NOT SURE WHETHER HE MAY HAVE BEEN ALERTED WITH THE MODE C PORTION OF MY SYS TURNED OFF AS I WAS REQUESTED TO DO SO BY ATC. ANOTHER FACTOR MAY HAVE BEEN THE WX. IT WAS MARGINAL AT THE TIME AND I THINK THAT A MORE POSITIVE TFC IDENT MAY HAVE BEEN MADE IF BETTER CONDITIONS WERE PRESENT AT THE TIME. THE LAST MAY HAVE BEEN CTLR AND PLT WORKLOAD.

WE DEPARTED AROUND XA00. THE GEOGRAPHY IS SUCH THAT A STRAIGHT LINE BACK TO HOUSTON FROM LAJITAS (IT IS NEAR THE BIG BEND NATIONAL PARK) WOULD CROSS THROUGH MEXICAN AIRSPACE. I AT FIRST THOUGHT THAT WE SHOULD LOOK UP AN ARPT THAT WAS N OF THE MEXICAN AIRSPACE THAT WE COULD USE TO CIRCUMVENT THEIR AIRSPACE.

MAYBE 15 MINS LATER; WE COULD SEE THAT THE 'SMALL CREEK BED' WAS NOW A LARGE RIVER WITH WATER. KNOWING THAT WE HAD ENTERED THE AIRSPACE; WE CONTACTED THE DEL RIO APCH CTL. BUT THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE WHEN WE GAVE THEM A POS RPT. WE DISCUSSED BTWN US (THE 2 PLTS) THAT POSSIBLY WE COULD BE INTERCEPTED AND WHAT AIR SIGNALS WOULD MEAN WHAT.

IMMEDIATELY AFTER TKOF; I CONTACTED DEP CTL; REQUESTED FLT FOLLOWING; RECEIVED A DISCRETE CODE; AND CLBED VFR TO 8500 FT MSL.

I MADE AN UNEVENTFUL LNDG AND TAXIED BACK TO THE 'RAMP' WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE THE PARKING LOT OF THE NEW NAVARRE STATE PARK.

THE STRIP I LANDED ON WAS THE SOON TO BE ENTRANCE ROAD TO THE PARK.

THE ACFT BELONGED TO A FRIEND OF MINE WHO HAS HIS PVT PLT'S LICENSE AND HAS BEEN WORKING ON HIS MULTI-ENG RATING WITH ME. HE SEEMED VERY PROFICIENT IN THE ACFT AND ONLY NEEDS VERBAL CORRECTION WHEN WE ARE DOING FLT TRAINING. THIS DAY WE WERE NOT TRAINING. WE WERE HEADED UP TO VERMONT. MY FRIEND WANTED TO MAKE A STOP-OVER AT AN ARPT (TPF) TO TAKE HIS YOUNGER COUSIN FOR A RIDE BEFORE WE WENT TO VA. I WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE AREA; BUT MY FRIEND WAS AND HE ASSURED ME THAT HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING. HE AND I HAVE BEEN FLYING TOGETHER FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW AND I FELT THAT HE WAS A VERY PROFICIENT PLT AND; SINCE HE WAS A PVT PLT; I WAS ALLOWING HIM TO DO ALL THE NAV ON HIS OWN.

I DON'T REMEMBER IF WE WERE ON A VECTOR (RADAR) OR OUR OWN NAV; BUT TAMPA INSTRUCTED US TO ADVISE THEM WHEN THE ARPT WAS IN SIGHT. MY FRIEND (WHO WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE AREA) ADVISED ME THAT HE THOUGHT HE HAD THE ARPT IN SIGHT; AT WHICH TIME I INSTRUCTED HIM NOT TO ADVISE TAMPA; UNTIL HE WAS SURE. JUST THEN; TAMPA; WHO HAD ALREADY ASKED A SECOND TIME FOR US TO 'ADVISE IN SIGHT; CAME ON THE RADIO AND SAID; 'ARPT 12 O'CLOCK POS AND 6 MI.' MY FRIEND KIND OF GAVE ME THE 'I TOLD YOU SO' LOOK AS HE RESPONDED; 'ROGER; FIELD IN SIGHT.' THERE WAS ONLY ONE FIELD AT 12 O'CLOCK POS AND THAT WAS THE ONE THAT MY FRIEND HAD POINTED OUT. AT THAT POINT; I WAS SATISFIED; BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE CTLR AND MY FRIEND AGREED WITH EACH OTHER AND THEY BOTH KNEW THE AREA. UPON LNDG; I SAW THE TWR LABELED MCDILL AND I QUESTIONED MY FRIEND ABOUT IT; THINKING MAYBE IT WAS AN OLD TWR. (LIKE I SAID; I DON'T KNOW THE AREA.) HE COULDN'T GIVE ME AN ANSWER. AT THAT TIME; I TOOK THE MAP FROM HIM AND REALIZED WHAT WE HAD JUST DONE. I THEN CONTACTED MCDILL TWR AND FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO ME BY THE CTLR. AFTER THE TAMPA CTLR HAD HANDED US OFF TO SQUAWK 1200; WE TUNED IN TPF. I REMEMBERED THERE WAS ANOTHER ACFT APCHING THE ARPT. I BELIEVE HE SAID HE WAS 6 MI OUT. I DON'T KNOW IF THE TAMPA CTLR HAD CONFUSED HIM FOR US; OR WHAT THE PROB WAS; BUT THERE WAS DEFINITELY SOMETHING WRONG THERE. BASED ON OUR ACTUAL RTE OF FLT THAT TOOK US TO MCDILL; TPF WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN AT OUR 2 O'CLOCK POS. THE PART THAT I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR IS NOT HAVING A MAP IN MY LAP. EVEN THOUGH MY FRIEND IS A PVT PLT; AND SHOULD BE FULLY QUALIFIED TO NAV; I REALIZE THAT I WAS THE ONLY ONE RATED IN THAT ACFT AND ULTIMATELY I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL ACTIONS IN IT. THEREFORE; IN THE FUTURE; WHEN I AM PIC; AND EVEN IF I AM NOT PIC; I WILL CONTINUE XCHKING THINGS UNTIL I HAVE CONVINCED MYSELF THAT WHAT I AM DOING IS RIGHT; RATHER THAN LETTING OTHERS CONVINCE ME. WHILE I WAS BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE MIL AGENCY; I HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH THE ARPT MGR WHO TOLD ME THIS SORT OF THING HAPPENS A FEW TIMES A YR. HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT MEMBERS OF THE MIL HAVE MISTAKEN TPF FOR MCDILL AND LANDED AT THE WRONG ONE. IT MAY BE BENEFICAL FOR TAMPA APCH TO MAKE PLTS VERIFY THAT THEY HAVE IDENTED TPF AND NOT MCDILL BEFORE CANCELING RADAR SVC.

AS I WAS BEING VECTORED ONTO THE FINAL APCH COURSE; I HIT A WALL OF HVY RAIN AND BEGAN TO LOSE THE R ENG AT THAT TIME. I ASSUMED IT WAS THE RAIN THAT WAS KILLING THE ENG (WRONG!) AND BEGAN TRYING TO DIAGNOSE THE PROB AND CTL THE AIRPLANE AT THE SAME TIME. AT THIS TIME; I RPTED THE PROB TO THE CTLR. THE RAIN AND WIND WERE FAIRLY STRONG AND COMPLICATING THE DIAGNOSIS AND KEPT ME FROM RUNNING THE EMER CHKLIST. ABOUT THIS TIME THE 2ND ENG FAILED AS WELL AND I BEGAN A STEEP DSCNT ABOUT 7-9 MI FROM THE ARPT; AS I ESTABLISHED BEST GLIDE. I TOLD THE CTLR I HAD NOW LOST BOTH ENGS AND HE TOLD ME THAT I WOULD NOT MAKE MDW AT THE CURRENT RATE OF DSCNT. FOR WHATEVER REASON (LUCK; TRAINING; OR ABJECT FEAR); I SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT I HAD BEEN ON THE AUX FUEL TANKS AND SWITCHED TO THE MAINS (WHICH EACH HAD 40 GALS IN THEM). BOTH ENGS CAME TO LIFE JUST AS MDW CAME INTO SIGHT. I TOLD THE CTLR THIS AND HE HANDED ME OFF TO THE TWR. THE TWR APPROVED RWY 4R AND I MADE A SOMEWHAT NORMAL LNDG (GIVEN MY STRESS LEVEL IT WAS FAR FROM PICTURE PERFECT). MDW HAD ALREADY SCRAMBLED THE FIRE TRUCKS. I WILL NEVER AGAIN BE RUNNING ON AUX FUEL WHEN I BEGIN MY DSCNT. I WILL FIND A WAY TO GET THROUGH THE PRE-DSCNT CHKLIST NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.

BECAUSE I FLY OUT OF SNA (A CLASS C ARPT WHERE VFR AND IFR DEPS ARE ALWAYS COORDINATED WITH THE ADJOINING CTLING AGENCIES; I HAD ASSUMED I WOULD HAVE THE SAME DONE WHEN I WAS DROPPED BY LGB TWR). I BELIEVE THAT THE PROB WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED IF I HAD BEEN ADVISED BY LGB TWR TO CONTACT LOS ALAMITOS ON THE APPROPRIATE FREQ WHEN THEY DROPPED ME AT THE POINT THAT I WAS ALREADY IN ALAMEDA AIRSPACE. I HAVE LEARNED TO BE READY; BUT THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX; CONGESTED AREA AND FEEL THAT I FELL INTO A TRAP THAT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED BY MY NOT ACCEPTING THE CHANGED DEP AND MY NOT ASSUMING THAT MY DEP WOULD BE COORDINATED AS IT IS IN MOST ARPTS I FLY OUT OF.

APCHING THIS INTXN; I WAS CLRED FOR TKOF FROM RWY 32 AT TXWY K. I TAXIED ONTO THE RWY AND TURNED R TO ALIGN THE AIRPLANE WITH THE CTRLINE. HOWEVER; AS I TURNED TO WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE CTRLINE; THE VIEW DID NOT APPEAR NORMAL AND I REALIZED THAT I HAD ALREADY CROSSED THE CTRLINE AND SEEMED WELL TO THE L OF IT. I ADDED SOME PWR TO TAXI FORWARD AND TO THE R TO TRY TO REORIENT MYSELF. A RWY LIGHT APPEARED JUST IN FRONT OF AND TO THE L OF THE ACFT. I CHOPPED TE PWR AND TRIED SWERVING MORE TO THE R; BUT I WAS ALREADY TOO CLOSE TO IT AND COULD NOT AVOID IT. I FELT A SLIGHT IMPACT AND SAW GLASS FRAGMENTS AS THE L PROP STRUCK THE LIGHT. THE RWY LIGHT APPEARED TO BE JUST WITHIN THE ARC OF THE L PROP; OUTBOARD OF THE L MAIN LNDG GEAR; WHEN IT STRUCK. I PULLED BOTH PWR LEVERS TO IDLE AND CAME TO A FULL STOP. BOTH ENGS WERE STILL IDLING NORMALLY; ALL ENG GAUGES APPEARED NORMAL; AND NO DAMAGE WAS IMMEDIATELY VISIBLE. THERE WAS A SLIGHT VIBRATION ON THE L ENG. I INFORMED THE CTL TWR THAT I HAD JUST STRUCK A RWY LIGHT; AND REQUESTED TAXI CLRNC BACK TO THE RAMP. I TAXIED BACK TO THE RAMP; AND PERFORMED A NORMAL ENG SHUTDOWN. SUBSEQUENT EXAMINATION OF THE AIRPLANE INSIDE THE LIGHTED HANGAR REVEALED THAT THE 3-BLADED PROP ON THE L ENG HAD SUSTAINED DAMAGE. THE ENTIRE TIP WAS MISSING FROM 1 BLADE; THERE WERE NUMEROUS SIGNIFICANT DINGS AND SCRATCHES ON A SECOND; AND NO APPARENT DAMAGE TO THE THIRD. NO OTHER DAMAGE TO THE AIRPLANE WAS NOTICED. I WOULD ATTRIBUTE THE OCCURRENCE OF THIS INCIDENT TO BECOMING DISORIENTED IN THE DARK AS I TURNED ONTO RWY 32 AT TXWY K.

ANOTHER NIGHT FLT EARLIER THAT EVENING HAD RUN LATER THAN EXPECTED; RESULTING IN AN EVEN LATER DEP TIME FOR THIS PLANNED FLT -- IT WAS XH00 WHEN I BEGAN MY TAXI OUT. ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T CONSCIOUSLY FEEL FATIGUED; I HAD BEEN UP ALL NIGHT; AND MY BODY TIME CLOCK MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ACCLIMATED TO BEING UP ALL NIGHT. THIS MAY HAVE SLOWED MY OVERALL REACTIONS; AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE INITIAL DISORIENTATION; TO MY ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE THE UNUSUAL VISUAL PERSPECTIVE RESULTING FROM THAT; AND TO MY ABILITY TO RECOVER FROM IT. THE PROCESS OF COMPLETING FINAL ITEMS ON THE BEFORE-TKOF CHKLIST WHILE MANEUVERING FOR TKOF MAY ALSO HAVE BEEN A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE DISORIENTATION. IN THE FUTURE; I PLAN TO AVOID A RECURRENCE OF THIS KIND OF SIT BY REDUCING DISTRS; ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT AND IN THE SINGLE-PLT FLT ENVIRONMENT; BY FULLY COMPLETING CHKLISTS PRIOR TO MANEUVERING ONTO THE ACTIVE RWY; AND BY MAINTAINING A CLOSER WATCH ON THE VISUAL CUES PROVIDING GUIDANCE ONTO THE RWY (IE; YELLOW TXWY CTRLINE MARKINGS AND TRANSITIONS).

BOTH PAE AND RNO HAD VFR FORECAST FOR THE PERIOD. THE FLT WENT WELL AS WE HAD A SMOOTH RIDE BTWN LAYERS OF CLOUDS; BUT EXPERIENCED PROBS ABOUT 10 MINS FROM OUR DEST (RNO). AT THAT POINT; WE WERE FLYING AN ASSIGNED ALT OF 14000 FT; WHEN; OVER A PERIOD OF APPROX 5 MINS; WE EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT BUILDUP OF RIME ICE. OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME I NOTICED THAT OUR ACFT PERFORMANCE DEGRADED TO THE POINT WHERE I COULD NO LONGER MAINTAIN OUR ASSIGNED ALT. I ADJUSTED THE ACFT'S AIRSPD AND FOUND A POINT THAT MINIMIZED THE RATE OF DSCNT WITHOUT COMPROMISING MY ABILITY TO CTL THE ACFT AND ADVISED ATC OF THE SIT. THEY ADVISED ME THAT A LOWER ASSIGNED ALT OF 10700 FT WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN APPROX 9 MI (3-4 MINS). IN THE MEANTIME I WAS ABLE TO STOP THE RATE OF DSCNT AND LEVEL OUT AT APPROX 11600 FT. I HELD THIS ALT UNTIL A CLRNC WAS RECEIVED TO DSND AND MAINTAIN 10700 FT. I WAS THEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN ALL SUBSEQUENT ALT ASSIGNMENTS; SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING THE ILS APCH AND LNDG WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. IN REVIEWING MY PREFLT PLANNING AND WX BRIEFING PRINTOUT FOR THIS FLT; I DISCOVERED THAT I HAD OVERLOOKED AN AIRMET ON ICING FOR THE RNO AREA. TO AVOID THIS KIND OF PROB IN THE FUTURE; I PLAN TO MORE CAREFULLY SCRUTINIZE PREFLT PLANNING AND WX BRIEFING TO DO ALL I CAN TO AVOID ICING CONDITIONS. A GENERAL RULE THAT I PLAN TO USE IN THE FUTURE IS NOT TO FLY IN CLOUDS OF PRECIPITATION WHEN THE FREEZING LEVEL IS ON THE GND ALONG THE PLANNED RTE.

AT A HDG OF 270 DEGS I BEGAN TO OVERRIDE THE AUTOPLT MANUALLY WHILE TRYING TO REPROGRAM THE AUTOPLT. THIS LED TO FALSE SENSE OF CTL INPUTS RELATIVE TO THE ATTITUDE OF THE ACFT WHICH WAS NOTICED AS THE ACFT ENTERED A 45 DEG R BANK AND 1500 FPM DSCNT. AT 5500 FT MSL I DISENGAGED THE AUTOPLT AND THE DSCNT WAS STOPPED AND WINGS LEVELED.

I CONTACTED CTR SHORTLY AFTER TKOF. THE PATH WENT N OF ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATL PARK. ON DSCNT; THE AUTOPLT WOULD NOT FOLLOW A CTLED DSCNT. I FLEW THE ACFT MANUALLY TO DSND TOWARDS THE AREA S OF ZZZ2. THE ELECTRIC ALTIMETER WAS STUCK AT 13500 FT. AFTER VERIFYING THAT CO-PLT ALTIMETER AND VSI WERE WORKING AND THE DSCNT WAS NORMAL; I TURNED OFF THE OXYGEN. DURING THE DSCNT; COM #1; THE GPS BECAME INTERMITTENT; AND COM #2 WAS INOP. TO LOSE ALT AND STAY OUTSIDE ZZZ3 CLASS B AIRSPACE; I DID A L 360 DEG TURN. I CONTINUED THE DSCNT TO 7500 FT MSL. TO TRY TO GET THINGS WORKING; I CYCLED AVIONICS PWR TWICE; BUT THERE WAS NO IMPROVEMENT. I THEN TRIED EMER AVIONICS PWR; WHICH DID NOT HELP. I LOOKED UP LOSS OF AVIONICS PWR IN THE POH. THE PROC WAS WHAT I HAD ALREADY DONE. NEXT I CHKED FOR CIRCUIT BREAKER PROBS. THERE WERE NO CIRCUIT BREAKERS OUT. THEN I STARTED PULLING NON ESSENTIAL AVIONICS CIRCUIT BREAKERS. AFTER I PULLED THE ELECTRIC ALTIMETER CIRCUIT BREAKER; THE GPS STARTED WORKING AGAIN. I STILL DID NOT HAVE A RELIABLE FUEL INDICATION FROM THE FUEL GAUGE. EVEN THOUGH I THOUGHT THAT I PROBABLY HAD OVER 1 HR OF FUEL LEFT; I WAS VERY CONCERNED NOT HAVING VERIFICATION OF THE FUEL LEVEL. NEXT; I CHKED CURRENT DRAIN FROM BATTERY; WHICH WAS NEAR ZERO. THEN I CHKED THE BATTERY VOLTAGE; WHICH WAS MORE THAN 25 VOLTS; OK. ALL OF THE ABOVE DEBUG DONE AT 7500 FT MSL WHILE FLYING N/S OVER AND N OF ZZZ4. AT THIS POINT; I WAS NOT ABLE TO RECEIVE ON COM #2. HOWEVER; COM #1 (THE GPS) WORKED WELL ENOUGH TO RECEIVE ZZZ ATIS (VARIABLE/5 KTS; LNDG RWY 29R/L); AND SET THE CO-PLT'S ALTIMETER TO THE ATIS. NEXT; I SWITCHED TO ZZZ TWR ON COM #1. THE RADIO CHANNEL WAS VERY BUSY; AND IT TOOK A WHILE BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO XMIT. THEN I CALLED; 'PAN; PAN' SEVERAL TIMES TO COMMUNICATE MY URGENT SIT; BUT GOT NO RESPONSE. WITH CURRENT ATIS AND ZZZ AND THE URGENCY OF THE POTENTIAL LOW FUEL SIT; I MADE THE DECISION TO PROCEED TO ZZZ AND LAND WITH LIGHT SIGNALS. COM #1; THE GPS STARTED BLINKING SOME MORE; BUT I COULD STILL HEAR ZZZ TWR. I LOST ZZZ RECEIVER ON WAY TO ZZZ. I ASSUMED THAT I HAD AN AVIONICS ONLY FAILURE. I LOWERED THE LNDG GEAR TO INDICATE MY INTENTIONS TO LAND TO THE ZZZ TWR. BEFORE ENTERING R DOWNWIND FOR RWY 29R AT ZZZ; I DID A C-GUMPS CHK. THIS NORMALLY INCLUDES A CHK TO VERIFY '3 GREEN;' GEAR DOWN. I ENTERED ZZZ RWY 29R; R DOWNWIND AT 7000 FT MSL. THE EXTRA HT WAS TO STAY ABOVE NORMAL PATTERN ALT OF 6700 FT FOR SAFETY. DURING THIS WHOLE TIME; I WAS LOOKING FOR SIGNAL LIGHTS FROM THE TWR; BUT SAW NOTHING. AFTER THE TWR PASSED UNDER MY R WING; I DID A L 360 DEG TURN TO TRY AGAIN. AFTER ANOTHER DOWNWIND; I STILL DID NOT SEE ANY SIGNAL LIGHTS FROM THE TWR. ABEAM THE NUMBERS; I SET 15 DEGS FLAPS AND VERIFIED THE FLAPS WENT DOWN. WHILE GOING BASE TO FINAL; I WATCHED CAREFULLY FOR OTHER ACFT; AND ON FINAL LOOKED FOR SIGNAL LIGHTS AGAIN. ON SHORT FINAL; I SAW A PLANE MOVING ONTO RWY; AND WENT AROUND. ON THE GAR; I RAISED LNDG GEAR AND FLAPS TO CLB. THE FLT PATH WAS TO THE N OF TWR. I CONTINUED LOOKING FOR LIGHTS; BUT SAW NOTHING. NEXT; I RE-ENTERED DOWNWIND FOR RWY 29R; LOWERED LNDG GEAR; AND SET 15 DEGS FLAPS. I DID A SECOND C-GUMPS CHK WHILE LOOKING AT TWR FOR ANY SIGNAL LIGHTS. I STILL DID NOT SEE ANY LIGHTS. NEXT; I NOTICED THAT THE FLAP INDICATOR WAS NOT DOWN. I RAISED FLAP LEVER TO AVOID UNEXPECTED FLAP CONDITIONS LATER. ON BASE TO FINAL; I CONTINUED LOOKING FOR SIGNAL LIGHTS FROM TWR; BUT SAW NOTHING. THE RWY; TXWY; AND RUN-UP AREAS WERE ALL EMPTY. THIS IS VERY UNUSUAL FOR A FAIR WX SUNDAY. BASED ON THIS; I ASSUMED EMER PREPARATION WAS IN PROGRESS. AT THIS POINT; I PROCEEDED TO LAND. AS I SETTLED INTO THE FLARE; I HEARD PROP STRIKES. ALL I COULD DO THEN WAS KEEP THE PLANE CTRED ON RWY. AFTER LNDG; SMOKE ROSE IN CABIN. I THEN EXITED QUICKLY TO GRASS; AND WAITED FOR THE FIRE TRUCKS. COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: 1) GO OVER ELECTRICAL DEBUG ISSUES MORE PERSONALLY; IN TRAINING; AND CHK RIDES; ESPECIALLY AT THE MULTI-ENG LEVEL. THE MORE COMPLEX ISSUES IN MULTI-ENG ACFT MORE TRAINING AND SIMULATED EMERS. THE REQUIRED TRAINING IN SINGLE ENG OP IS GOOD; BUT THE OTHER COMPLEXITIES THAT COME WITH MULTI-ENG ACFT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED. 2) GIVEN THE PERCEIVED FUEL URGENCY; A BETTER COURSE OF ACTION WOULD HAVE BEEN TO CLB TO 3000 FT AGL OVER THE ARPT AND SORT OUT THE PROB WITH CALM DELIBERATE ACTION. THIS WOULD HAVE KEPT ENOUGH ALT IF THE FUEL WAS EXHAUSTED; WHILE GIVING TIME TO ANALYZE THE SIT BETTER. EMPHASIZE ALTERNATIVES LIKE THIS MORE IN FLT TRAINING. 3) PRACTICE REALISTIC; SIMULATED SIGNAL LIGHT SITS DURING TRAINING; DAY AND NIGHT; TO BECOME BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE. THIS COULD BE DONE WITH THE INSTRUCTOR USING A HANDHELD OR OTHER RADIO TO COORDINATE WITH THE TWR WHILE THE TWR COMMUNICATES WITH THE STUDENT VIA LIGHT SIGNALS.",,,,"C310 PLT LANDED GEAR UP AFTER DISTR FROM 5 SYS NOT WORKING PROPERLY.",

THE TWR CTLR CALLED FOR THE LANCE TO START ITS BASE LEG; THEN CALLED US (TWIN) TO TURN THE BASE LEG. THE LANCE WAS INSTRUCTED TO LAND. AS I RECALL NO INSTRUCTION WAS PROVIDED ON WHICH RWY THE LANCE WAS TO LAND ON. THE LANCE APPEARED TO BE UNDECIDED WHICH RWY TO LAND ON DURING HIS FINAL APCH. TWR INSTRUCTIONS WERE FOR ME TO CONTINUE MY APCH TO LAND ON RWY 27L -- THE RWY (RWY 27R IS THE TXWY/TEMP RWY). THE LANCE THEN LANDED ON RWY 27L AND I WAS INSTRUCTED TO LAND BEHIND THE LANCE. I PROCEEDED TO LAND; ASSUMING THE LAND SHORT/MIDDLE/LONG SEQUENCE THAT IS NORMALLY FOLLOWED WAS IN EFFECT AND THAT THE CTLR WOULD PROVIDE VERBAL INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LANE TO LAND/TAXI FURTHER DOWN THE RWY. AFTER I LANDED AND APPLIED MAX BRAKING; THE LANCE STOPPED ON THE RWY IMMEDIATELY AHEAD. THE CTLR THEN TOLD ME TO GO AROUND. I COULD NOT GO AROUND AS MY AIRSPD WAS LESS THAN 50 KTS. THE TWR CTLR THEN TOLD THE LANCE TO PROCEED DOWN THE RWY; WHICH HE DID NOT DO. GND CTLRS (APPROX 4) WERE BASED AT THE L SIDE OF THE RWY. ONE OF THE GND CTLRS WAS HOLDING THE BATONS IN THE 'X' POS INSTRUCTING ME TO STOP. I STOPPED APPROX 50 FT FROM THE LANCE. BECAUSE OF THE PROX OF THE GND CTLR TO THE LANCE; THAT PLT MAY HAVE MISTAKEN MY STOP INSTRUCTION FOR HIM. AFTER ANALYZING THE EVENTS; I CONCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: 1) I SHOULD HAVE INITIATED THE GAR AND IGNORED THE CTLR'S INSTRUCTIONS AFTER CLR DIRECTIONS WERE NOT PROVIDED TO THE LANCE (L/R RWY AND LAND MID/LONG). 2) THE CTLR'S PERFORMANCE THAT DAY WAS NOT EQUIVALENT TO THAT REQUIRED OR DEMONSTRATED AT OTHER TIMES FOR THE ACTIVITIES -- INADEQUATE L/R GUIDANCE; NO INSTRUCTION/FOLLOW-THROUGH ON LNDG POINTS (LONG/MIDDLE/SHORT) AND POOR CALLOUTS IN GENERAL. 3) THE GND CTLRS AT THE EDGE OF THE RWY WERE NOT PROVIDING ADEQUATE GUIDANCE.

THE FLT WAS QUITE UNEVENTFUL. AFTER GETTING ME DOWN TO 1600 FT; TAMPA APCH CTL CLRED ME FOR THE VISUAL APCH INTO TPF. I HAD 3 DIFFERENT VFR GPS'S IN THE PLANE; PANEL MOUNT ARNAV MDF; ARNAV 5000 FT; AND 1 GPS YOKE MOUNT. THE PANEL MOUNT ARNAV 5000 HAD A BAD CHK SUM; SO I WAS IGNORING THE PANEL MOUNTS; BUT KEEPING REF WITH THE GPS. APCH ADVISED THAT TPF WAS 11 O'CLOCK POS AND 7 MI. I CONSULTED MY VFR CHART AND SAW THAT THE FIELD WAS ACROSS FROM A BODY OF WATER. AS I TURNED THE PLANE A LITTLE TO THE L; IT LOOKED LIKE THE FIELD WAS ACROSS FROM THE BODY OF WATER IN FRONT OF ME. I SAW A RWY THAT ALSO LOOKED LIKE A CONFIGN THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR; 3-21 AT TPF. I ADVISED THE CTLR THAT I HAD THE FIELD IN SIGHT. ATC APPROVED FREQ CHANGE TO THE TPF CTAF AND ADVISED ME OF THE IFR CANCELING PROC. SEEMED LIKE I HAD THE FIELD MADE; SO I WENT AHEAD AND CANCELED THE IFR FLT PLAN. I CHANGED THE FREQ TO THE TPF CTAF AND REQUESTED ADVISORIES FOR LNDG. TPF UNICOM ADVISED THAT WINDS WERE FAVORING RWY 3. I ANNOUNCED MY INTENTIONS; JOINED THE DOWNWIND; AND EXECUTED A R-HAND PATTERN. DURING THE PATTERN; I GLANCED AT MY GPS AND NOTICED THAT THE SCREEN WAS BLANK. THE PWR CORD HAD FALLEN OUT OF THE BACK OF THE GPS AND EVEN THOUGH IT HAD SUFFICIENT BATTERIES; THE GPS HAD TIMED OUT BEFORE I COULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I WANTED TO RUN IT ON BATTERIES. WHILE LNDG; I NOTICED SOMETHING ODD ABOUT THE RWY SINCE THERE WAS AN ORANGE BARRIER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DISPLACED THRESHOLD. I FOCUSED ALL MY ATTN TO MAKE SURE I LANDED BEYOND THE BARRIERS. HAVING NOT LANDED THE PLANE IN 3 MONTHS; I CONGRATULATED MYSELF FOR A GOOD LNDG. I MADE THE FIRST TAXI EXIT. AS I TAXIED OFF THE RWY; I STARTED TO LOOK AROUND FOR THE FBO. THERE WERE A FEW SMALL BUILDINGS ON THE APCH END OF THE RWY WHICH LOOKED LIKE A TYPICAL FBO STYLE BUILDING WITH A RAMP AND A FEW SMALL PLANES. BUT THERE WERE ALSO INTERCONNECTING TXWYS CONNECTING TO FAR AWAY HANGARS; RAMP AND PLANES. I WAS JUST ABOUT TO CLICK THE MIKE TO CALL THE UNICOM TO CONFIRM LOCATION OF THE GA RAMP WHEN I NOTICED A COUPLE OF EMER VEHICLES; LOOKED LIKE FIRE TRUCKS HEADED IN MY DIRECTION. SOON THE SCENE BECAME ONE FROM THE TV COP SHOWS. MIL POLICE WITH A DOZEN DIFFERENT VEHICLES HAD ME SURROUNDED AND SECURED MY PERSON. AND THEN SOMEONE ASKED ME IF I KNEW WHERE I WAS. I TOLD THEM FROM THE RECEPTION I HAD; I PROBABLY DIDN'T. THEN SOMEONE TOLD ME THAT I WAS AT THE MCDILL AFB AND HAD LANDED ON RWY 4/22. WHEN SOMEONE ASKED ME; 'WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?' I TOLD THEM; 'PETER O'KNIGHT.' ONCE THE SECURITY FOLKS WERE SATISFIED THAT IT WAS AN HONEST MISTAKE; I WAS TOLD BY MANY A PERSONNEL AT MCDILL THAT SUCH AN INCIDENT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE. I WAS NOT THE FIRST ONE. THE DEST FOR THE PREVIOUS INADVERTENT LNDGS WAS ALSO TPF. SO WHAT WOULD I DO DIFFERENTLY NEXT TIME? I WILL BE VERY PARANOID ABOUT LOOKING FOR OTHER ARPTS ON THE VFR CHARTS; ESPECIALLY IN CTLED AIRSPACES; WITH CONFIGNS SIMILAR TO THE DEST ARPT. I WILL MAKE A BETTER MENTAL PICTURE OF VISUALLY IDENTING THE ARPT. I WILL VERIFY LOCATION ON THE GPS BEFORE ENTERING THE PATTERN. AND; ALTHOUGH I AM ALWAYS AFRAID OF FORGETTING TO CANCEL FLT PLANS; SENDING OFF SEARCH AND RESCUE PARTIES; AND DISRUPTING FLYING BUSINESS; I WILL PROBABLY NOT CANCEL MY IFR FLT PLAN UNTIL I HAVE REALLY CONFIRMED THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT FIELD IN SIGHT.",,,,"C310 PLT MADE AN UNAUTH LNDG AT MCF; FL.",

UPON GEAR RETRACTION ON DEPARTURE; A LOUD AND ABNORMAL 'BANG' WAS HEARD FROM BENEATH THE FLOORBOARDS UNDER MY FEET. KNOWING THE SOMEWHAT TROUBLING ISSUES WITH THE CESSNA 300/400 SERIES LNDG GEAR (HAVING PURCHASED AND READ THE AVIATION SAFETY RPT ON THE C-310); I HAD A TERRIBLE SINKING FEELING THAT THIS HAD THE POTENTIAL TO TURN UGLY AT ARR. AN AMBER 'GEAR UP' INDICATION MADE ME FEEL A LITTLE BIT BETTER; BUT ANTICIPATED THE WORST UPON ARR AT ZZZ. INDEED; UPON CONTACTING ZZZ TWR ON ARR (TIMING COULDN'T HAVE BEEN WORSE; AS IS WAS JUST PRIOR TO THE OPENING OF A LARGE EVENT AT THE ARPT); I SELECTED 'GEAR DOWN' AND GOT GOOD INDICATION ON THE MAINS; BUT NOTHING ON THE NOSE GEAR. NOTIFIED TWR OF THE PROB AND THAT WE WANTED TO ORBIT TO DEAL WITH THE PROB. AFTER RE-CYCLING THE GEAR NORMALLY SEVERAL TIMES AND SWAPPING LIGHT BULBS; RESORTED TO THE EMER CHKLIST FOR LNDG GEAR EXTENSION PROBS. AFTER HAVING RUN THOSE DRILLS SEVERAL TIMES TO NO AVAIL; AND HAVING STAYED IN CONTACT WITH ZZZ TWR THIS WHOLE TIME. ON FURTHER DISCUSSION WITH ZZZ TWR (WHO HAD SO GRACIOUSLY GIVEN US THEIR GND FREQ TO UTILIZE 100% TO OURSELVES DURING ALL OF THESE CONVERSATIONS) WE AGREED THAT A FLY-BY WAS IN ORDER; JUST TO CONFIRM EVERYTHING WE WERE THINKING. INDEED; THE FLY-BY PROVED THAT THE GEAR WAS TRAILING UNDERNEATH THE ACFT; AND THAT BASICALLY NO AMOUNT OF MANEUVERING WOULD FORCE THE GEAR TO SWING FORWARD INTO THE SLIPSTREAM AND LOCK DOWN. AFTER DISCUSSING AT LENGTH OUR OPTIONS; WE AS A TEAM; DECIDED THAT THE BETTER OPTION FOR LNDG WOULD BE IN ZZZ1. WHEN WE FELT WE WERE READY; WE SWITCHED OVER TO ZZZ1 TWR FREQ; AND CONTINUED WITH THE DISCUSSIONS WE'D BEEN HAVING WITH THE FOLKS IN ZZZ. ZZZ1 TWR NOTIFIED CFR FOR US; AND ONCE WE HAD VISUAL CONFIRMATION OF THE CRASH TRUCKS ON THE TXWYS; ELECTED TO FLY OVER ONE TIME AT HIGH ALT; SO WE COULD REHEARSE EACH STEP OF OUR PLAN. WE TALKED WITH ZZZ1 TWR AND CFR; NOTIFYING THEM OF THE POSITIONS OF OUR CHILDREN; AND INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO UNBUCKLE THEM FROM THEIR CAR SEATS IN CASE WE WERE SOMEHOW INCAPACITATED AFTER THE CRASH LNDG. KNOWING THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE WE COULD DO; WE LANDED ON RWY 29 IN ZZZ1 IN CALM WINDS. ALL WENT EXACTLY AS WE HAD ALL PLANNED IT; AND WE EVACUATED THE ACFT IN RECORD TIME. THERE WAS NO FIRE ON THE ACFT; AND WE THEN SWITCHED INTO 'RECOVERY' MODE. INSPECTION BY LOCAL MECHANICS FOUND THAT THE PUSH TUBE THAT EXTENDS THE GEAR HAD BROKEN INTO TWO PIECES; RIGHT AT A HOLE WHERE A RIVET ATTACHES THE PUSH TUBE TO ANOTHER FITTING. THESE PIECES ARE UNDERGOING METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION AT THIS TIME. THE ACFT HAD RECENTLY UNDERGONE ITS ANNUAL INSPECTION; WITH NOTHING TRULY NOTEWORTHY TO MENTION. ACFT HAS OVER 4200 HOURS TOTAL TIME; AND I'M UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE PUSH TUBE HAS BEEN ON THIS ACFT SINCE IT WAS BUILT. THE FRUSTRATING PART OF ALL THIS IS THAT THE EMER EXTENSION SYSTEM UTILIZES THE EXACT SAME PUSH TUBE THAT THE NORMAL SYSTEM DOES. THE EMER EXTENSION SYSTEM IS THERE BASICALLY IN CASE OF AN ELECTRICAL PROB AND THE GEAR WON'T EXTEND ELECTRICALLY. ALSO FRUSTRATING IS THAT IN ALL OF THE PART 25 ACFT I'VE FLOWN; THE SLIPSTREAM HELPS TO FORCE THE NOSE LNDG GEAR DOWN; AND IN SOME CASES; EVEN THE MAIN GEAR LEGS. THIS IS NOT THE CASE IN THE CESSNA 310; WHICH IS MOST UNFORTUNATE. SOME ACFT UTILIZE A NITROGEN 'BLOW-DOWN' TYPE OF BACK-UP SYSTEM; BUT AGAIN; NOT IN THE CESSNA 310 RANKS. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR STATED THE LNDG WENT PRETTY SMOOTH BUT THE ACFT INCURRED DAMAGE TO BOTH PROPELLERS AND SOME SKIN DAMAGE.

THE TWIN WAS IN VFR CONDITIONS AND TOOK NO OBSERVABLE EVASIVE ACTION ALTHOUGH IF I WERE HIM; I WOULD HAVE GONE BELOW GS TO GUARANTEE SEPARATION WHICH HE PROBABLY DID. IN THE FUTURE; IT IS MY RULE TO REMAIN IN THE DOWNWIND LEG UNTIL WE ARE SEQUENCED OR OTHERWISE CLRED EVEN IF THE DOWNWIND LEG BECOMES MUCH LONGER THAN IT SHOULD.

I WAITED OUTSIDE THE ACFT FOR FIRE EQUIP WHICH ARRIVED IN SECONDS AFTER I EXITED THE PLANE. THE ASPECTS THAT I CONSIDER MOST IMPORTANT TO WHAT THE FAA IS CLASSIFYING AS AN INCIDENT DUE TO NO MAJOR STRUCTURAL DAMAGE ARE: 1) I ALWAYS HAVE A HANDHELD GPS AND COM RADIO SET UP FOR MY DEPS WITH FREQS ALREADY SET. 2) ALL TRAINING THAT I HAD IN EMER GEAR EXTENSION WAS WITH THE LNDG LIGHT INDICATOR ON TO SHOW DOWN AND LOCKED. TRAINING MUST INCLUDE PRACTICE IN WHAT DOWN AND LOCKED 'FEELS' LIKE IN CASE THE GREEN GEAR DOWN LIGHTS DO NOT WORK. 3) IF SYS (FLAPS; ETC) ARE ELECTRICAL DURING ELECTRICAL MALFUNCTIONS; DO NOT PLACE THEM IN FULL POS; IF POSSIBLE; IF THAT POS MIGHT HINDER PERFORMANCE OF A POTENTIAL MISSED APCH. 4) FOR CTLRS TO ISSUE A 'GEAR DOWN AND LOCKED' REPLY MIGHT GIVE PLTS AN UNDUE REASSURANCE THAT THE GEAR IS OK. WOULD BE MORE ADVISABLE TO STATE 'GEAR APPEARS DOWN' AND MAYBE TO INDICATE THAT THEY CAN'T DETERMINE 'LOCKED' FROM THE GND. 5) AS STUDENTS; PLTS SHOULD BE TRAINED ON NIGHT FLYING WITH NO ELECTRICAL SUPPLY AND HOLDING A FLASHLIGHT WHILE FLYING AND PERFORMING OTHER DUTIES. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR STATED THE LNDG GEAR IS OPERATED BY THE ELECTRIC MOTORS AND WITH PWR LOST THE LNDG GEAR HAD TO BE HAND CRANKED DOWN. THE GEAR WAS CRANKED UNTIL THE GEAR CRANK COULD NOT BE MOVED ANY FURTHER AND WITH NO INDICATIONS OF GEAR POS; THE GEAR WAS BELIEVED TO BE DOWN AND LOCKED AS CONFIRMED BY THE TWR FLY-BY. ON LNDG; THE GEAR COLLAPSED INCURRING DAMAGE TO THE AIRPLANE.

SIGNIFICANT CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY WAS PRESENT TO THE NE; E; SE; AND S. TO THE W AND SW CUMULUS CLOUDS WERE BUILDING IN TYPICAL SUMMER MIDWEST FASHION. APPROX 50 DME SW OF CVG VOR; ATC BEGAN ISSUING VECTORS FOR TFC AVOIDANCE. AT FIRST THEY ISSUED A DESCENT TO 7000 FT. WITH SCATTERED TO BROKEN CUMULUS PRESENT; PLUS TURB I TOLD ATC I WAS UNABLE TO COMPLY DUE TO WEATHER. A DESCENT TO A LOWER ALT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNCOMFORTABLE AT THE LEAST AND HAZARDOUS AT THE MOST FOR MYSELF AND MY THREE PAX. AS AN ALTERNATE I INFORMED ATC I COULD ACCEPT AN OFF COURSE VECTOR. THE CTLR CAME BACK WITH AN EASTERLY HDG. WITH A SOLID LINE OF CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY FROM THE SW TO THE NE; THIS TOO WAS UNACCEPTABLE. I TOLD THE CTLR A L TURN WOULD KEEP ME CLR OF THE WX AND HE SAID 'FINE; TURN L TO A HDG OF 160 DEGS.' I'VE HAD SOME OFF-COURSE VECTORS BEFORE; BUT NEVER 230 DEGS AND CERTAINLY NOT INTO CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY. I INFORMED HIM I COULD NOT ACCEPT THIS AND HE BECAME PANICKY STATING 'YOU'RE GONNA CRASH INTO ANOTHER AIRPLANE.' I CALMLY REPLIED 'NOBODY IS GOING TO CRASH INTO ANYBODY.' VISIBILITY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TFC (NW) WAS UNRESTRICTED. I WAS NEVER ABLE TO VISUALLY ACQUIRE ANY TFC AND THERE WAS NO LOSS OF SEPARATION OR SAFETY ISSUE. AS FAR AS THE LATTER IS CONCERNED; THE SAME CANNOT BE SAID HAD I ACCEPTED THE INANE VECTORS TO FLY THROUGH THE THUNDERSTORMS. I HAVE READ TOO MANY ACCIDENT RPTS THAT STATE 'WITNESSES OBSERVED ACFT FALLING FROM SKY MINUS WINGS' AND THE LIKE. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS INCLUDE: THE CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY IN AND AROUND THE APCH AND DEP CORRIDORS SURROUNDING CVG; FREQUENCY CONGESTION LEADING TO PARTIAL TRANSMISSIONS AND/OR REPLIES; AND MOST SIGNIFICANTLY; THE RELATIVE INEXPERIENCE OF SOME OF THE RADAR CTLRS IN THIS SECTOR. ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN DOING THIS FOR ANY AMOUNT OF TIME RECOGNIZES A ROOKIE AND MAKES ALLOWANCES FOR THESE PLTS/CTLRS. PERHAPS IT IS A LACK OF APPRECIATION OF OPS AROUND SIGNIFICANT METEOROLOGICAL EVENTS; OR THE INABILITY OF ATC TO 'SEE' THE WEATHER. IN ANY CASE; I WOULD BE LAX IN MY PLT-IN-COMMAND RESPONSIBILITIES IF I ALLOWED ATC TO PUT MY PAX AND ACFT IN A SIT WHERE THERE WAS A GREAT PROBABILITY OF GRAVE DANGER. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: PLT STATED THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE FLOWN HIS ACFT INTO THAT PARTICULAR WEATHER EVEN IF HIS CARGO WAS FREIGHT; MUCH LESS HUMANS.

THERE WAS NO KNOWN TFC ON RWY 9L AND NO TFC ON THE TXWYS ADJACENT TO RWY 9R. VISIBILITY WAS +6 MI. THE PLT HAS BEEN FLYING INTO PBI FOR THE PAST 30 YRS AND AT LEAST 6 TIMES IN THE PAST YR. WITHIN THE PAST YR; A TXWY HAS BEEN ADDED BTWN RWY 9R AND RWY 9L. THERE IS 1 VASI LOCATED TO THE L OF RWY 9R. THE PLT LANDED ON THE TXWY TO THE L OF RWY 9R THINKING IT WAS THE RWY. ADDED TO THE CONFUSION IS THE WIDTH OF THE TXWY AND THE 'NEWNESS' OF THE ASPHALT. THE PLT FORGOT ABOUT THE RECENT ADDITION OF THE TXWY. THE PLT RECOGNIZED THE ERROR UPON FLARING; HOWEVER; DECIDED TO LAND SINCE A GAR WOULD HAVE; PERHAPS; CAUSED MORE OF A PROB. THE PLT DID NOT OBSERVE ANY TFC ON THE TXWY OR IN THE VICINITY OF LNDG. IMMEDIATELY UPON LNDG; THE PLT CALLED THE TWR REQUESTING TAXI TO CUSTOMS. THE PLT WAS ASKED TO CALL ATC VIA LANDLINE. HAVING TALKED TO ATC; IT WAS LEARNED THAT ANOTHER ACFT LANDED ON THE TXWY THE SAME AFTERNOON AND THERE HAD BEEN 4 SUCH INCIDENTS RECENTLY. THE ACFT INVOLVED IS PRESSURIZED AND THE AIR CONDITIONING HAD FAILED ON THE RETURN FLT FROM MYAT. THE CABIN TEMP WAS OVER 100 DEGS F; CONTRIBUTING TO PLT STRESS AND THE NEED TO LAND ASAP. IN ADDITION; THE PLT HAD TO MAKE EVASIVE MANEUVERS PRIOR TO LNDG TO AVOID A FLOCK OF BIRDS AT APPROX 150-200 FT. THE OUTSIDE AIR TEMP WAS CLOSE TO 90 DEGS F WITH HIGH HUMIDITY. THIS SUBSTANTIALLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE ERROR. THE TYPICAL VFR APCH APPEARS TO BE OVER LANTANA ARPT (5 MI TO THE S) AND A TIGHT R BASE TO RWY 9R. WITH LOWER VISIBILITY; THIS PROVIDES LESS TIME TO SET UP A PROPER APCH FOR THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE ARPT. I WOULD RECOMMEND ADDITIONAL METHOD OF IDENTING THE ACTIVE RWY (RWY 9R) TO AVOID CONFUSION. THE USE OF END OF RWY STROBES OR REIL LIGHTING; OR EVEN THE USE OF RWY LIGHTING DURING THE DAYTIME WOULD AVOID THIS PROB. IT APPEARS THIS IS A CONCERN TO THE TWR ATC PERSONNEL BASED ON THE PHONE CONVERSATION; AND THEY ARE ALSO LOOKING AT SOLUTIONS FOR THIS PROB.",,,,"C337 PLT LANDS ON NEW TXWY PARALLEL TO RWY 9R AT PBI.",

After the Pilot Flying raised the landing gear switch; I noticed that the amber 'gear up' light did not come on. The gear had not retracted and this was confirmed when I looked out at the mirror on the left wing strut and confirmed that the main gear was still down while the main gear doors remained open. The nose gear appeared to be down although I could not see the nose gear doors clearly through the mirror. I then assumed command of the aircraft and directed the Pilot Flying to continue while I worked through the POH emergency procedure for a landing gear failure. I also contacted our Director of Maintenance via radio and he was helpful in troubleshooting the situation. Per the POH; I pulled and reset the 'landing gear motor' CB. The motor CB popped and was not reset. We did not have either 'gear up' amber light or a 'gear down' green light and the gear warning horn was sounding at all times. I elected not to try to retract the gear as suggested by the POH; but did use the emergency gear pump and pumped 50 strokes before directing the Pilot Flying to pump another 50 strokes while I flew the aircraft. The POH says 95 strokes should result in increased resistance which told me that something was not right; but we did not know what the problem really was. Through the Director of Maintenance; I received direction from the company owner/Director of Operations to land the airplane at ZZZ and keep weight off the nose gear as long as possible. I landed the airplane on Runway 22 with little or no wind blowing and held the nose gear off as long as possible. When the nose gear lowered to the runway; it appeared that it might hold although the airplane appeared to be in a nose low attitude (like when the nose strut is not inflated). After 3-4 seconds the aircraft nose continued to descend until the front prop struck the runway and stopped turning. At the same time the airplane swerved to the left and I immediately applied hard right rudder and brake. After the aircraft left the runway and was headed for a deep ditch; I applied full braking on both brakes and the airplane came to rest some 50 FT from the runway and on fairly level ground. I opened the door; directed the Pilot Not Flying to turn off the master switch and magneto switches and exited the airplane and then made sure the other Pilot exited and we were both clear of the airplane. This is the end of the incident since there was no fire or further action taken other than to remove the airplane from the runway area. Upon inspection; the Director of Maintenance found a broken centering spring to be the probable cause for the nose gear not to be locked in the down position.",,,,"Nose gear of Cessna 337 fails to retract after takeoff and cannot be extended fully for landing.

The temperature was 12 degrees C; dew point was 11 degrees C. It had been raining and the runway was damp with partial drying. Touched down in the first 500 FT of the runway. I encountered three deer on the runway approximately 5-10 seconds after touchdown during the rollout. I didn't have time to react with braking or evasive action. The deer bolted out of the way just before an impending impact. The deer weren't visible during the approach or touchdown. I can't think of anything out of the ordinary that a pilot could do to avoid this situation short of doing a low approach and full traffic pattern. This isn't a normal procedure nor is it one I'd recommend as a normal procedure; especially at night. I do recommend that more stringent measures ie; fences; high frequency noise; lights or other measures be taken to discourage and prevent wildlife from entering and loitering in runway environments; especially during nighttime operations.

We could not find any problems; engines were producing full power; all indications were normal; the aircraft was not exhibiting any abnormal indications of any sort. We continued on to our destination; ZZZ; without anymore problems. Upon extending the gear; before entering the pattern; we noticed that we did not have a nose gear green light. We went through the troubleshooting procedure; and then made a low pass over Runway XX. We had some friends on the ground check our gear as we flew over. They confirmed that the nose gear was not fully down and locked. We did not retract the gear; but flew back to ZZZ with the gear down and planned a nose gear up landing. I called ZZZ ATCT about 10 miles out and explained our situation. I did not declare an emergency. We discussed which runway we might use; and decided to use Runway YY. The Tower offered us a low pass on Runway XX to check our gear. We accepted their offer; and I made a low pass over Runway XX. The Tower confirmed that our nose gear was not fully extended. We did not attempt alternate gear extension; because the alternate gear extension will not extend only 1 gear. With the mains down and locked; it will not extend the nose gear. I climbed back up to pattern altitude; and I entered a right downwind for Runway YY. We reviewed the abnormal checklist for a nose gear up landing. I planned a soft-field type approach and landing; which I have performed many times previously. I would be making this landing. I extended my downwind far enough to allow for a longer than normal; stabilized final approach. We approached with flaps 20 degrees and airspeed at just above Blue Line; per the checklist. We planned to shut down both engines; just before landing. As we crossed the threshold and just before flaring; we secured both engines. I touched down and held back pressure and smoothly increased back pressure; holding off the nose; until the nose finally dropped to the pavement. We then skidded several hundred FT to a stop. Once stopped; and seeing that we were both ok; we confirmed that switches were off; and exited the aircraft. The Crash Fire Rescue trucks were approaching us; but there was no fire nor sign of fire -- we both emerged safely; without a scrape; and had attempted to minimize damage to the aircraft.

I took off on Runway 13 with a left downwind departure; transponder squawking 1200 on altitude. I followed the east side of Utah Lake on climbout to 8;500 FT (below the 9;000 FT outer base of the SLC Class B airspace). I also had the DME tuned into the Provo VOR/DME. The idea was to contact SLC Approach; ATC; pick up the clearance into the Class B airspace then transition through the Class B airspace to the Bonneville 67 degree radial following the radial to the VOR navigating between the restricted areas to the west. Still climbing to 8;500 FT about 14 miles on the DME from the Provo VOR/DME near as I can tell still clear of the Class B airspace; I tried contacting ATC 3 times before I was successful. Somewhere in there thinking that I had plenty of room to the west before entering into the Class B airspace; I turned to a westerly direction. On contact with ATC; after squawking the transponder frequency given; I waited then was asked to ID. I'm flying a twin engine Cessna that's almost twice as fast as a single engine. I'm now either entering the Class B airspace or about to. I'm talking to SLC Approach but unsure if I have clearance to enter Class B airspace. (I have heard Controllers say 'you are cleared to enter the Class B airspace' but not usually.) Usually I would get an acknowledgement and then a vector. I looked at my DME and it was now reading 17 miles from the Provo VOR/DME. Now is where it gets confusing. Do I start turning the airplane away from the Class B airspace while talking to the Controller? In what direction and what is he expecting? If I make some wild turn in an unknown direction while in contact with the Controller; does the situation get worse or better? Does he have me on radar or not? On reflecting back; I was stupid. I should have never let the situation get this far. The Controller finally did get back to me and told me to make an immediate turn to the east. I did. At that point; there was mountainous terrain in close proximity in front of me that was higher than my flight path. This was concerning; however; the Controller did vector me back to the west and asked for a direct course heading to my destination. Since I originally intended to transition to the Bonneville VOR I had an idea but not an exact course heading for the Controller. It took a few moments to input my destination into the GPS which I gave the Controller shortly after. The Controller cleared me on a direct heading. Once enroute; the Controller gave me a phone number to write down so I would call him later. I did. I called the number given to me; it was SLC Approach. The gentleman I talked to was very nice over the phone. He mentioned 2 things that struck me. One is that I was #29 this year that had done something similar. That's one Class B incursion every 3 days on the average. Second is that coming from the Provo Airport direction that SLC Approach was having difficulty making good radio contact farther than 4 miles out. Perhaps with a higher altitude that would improve; I did not ask that question. I'm not sure I have a good solution yet; other than to simply do some good flight planning before takeoff.",,,,"VFR C310 departing from PVU entered SLC Class without ATC clearance; reporter citing aircraft performance; airspace limitations; terrain and preflight planning failures and causal factors.",

Upon reaching 3900 FT I noticed an unusual reading on my Fuel Flow computer. The GPH flow on the left engine had dropped slightly in the climb; as we were about to reach the bottom of the Class B airspace when the fuel flow reading dropped to 11.2 GPH on the left engine. The aircraft had been in maintenance in the past several weeks for a fuel flow check based on a recent Owner Advisory from Cessna. The outside air temperature (OAT) at this point was approximately 90 to 95 degrees and climbing with a forecast high of 114 degrees Fahrenheit. As mentioned; all of a sudden the left engine fuel flow dropped to 11.2 GPH (both engine fuel flows had been reading approximately 23.5 GPH). My location was approximately 8 miles Northwest of Falcon Field with a Class B ceiling of 4000 FT. I was also within ten miles of Scottsdale Airport. I observed the drop for about twenty (20) seconds; and the fuel flow did not improve. I then made the decision to go through a standard diagnostic to determine whether or not I might be facing an emergency shut down of the left engine. Since it was a hot and getting hotter I made the decision to initiate a gentle climb in order to ensure that I had enough altitude in case I had to return to either airport. Climb performance was estimated to be in the 200 FPM range with the elevated temperatures. Falcon is a student training airport with lots of flight activity and Scottsdale; was fairly light in traffic when I left; so I proceeded northwest bound and began my diagnosis. I wanted enough altitude so that if I did have an emergency; I could return to either airport recognizing that at Falcon there would be more traffic - however it was closer at this point. I climbed approximately 600 FT into the Class B airspace - I was not authorized to do so but felt it was key to managing the potential emergency. I did not at this point in time call an emergency for a low fuel flow; nothing of significance had yet happened. I first cross-referenced the Fuel Flow Computer with the standard Analog fuel gauge; which was installed on the co-pilots side. The fuel flow computer read 11.2 GPH and the Analog gage read 21.5 GPH. The fuel flow computer for the right engine read 23.5 GPH and the Analog for the right engine read 22.8 GPH - at this time I felt that further diagnosis was required before taking the next step of either shutting the engine down and/or calling an in-flight emergency. I chose to keep current heading until I could further assess the situation for I still had both airport options with a decision to proceed to Scottsdale if the situation worsened. At this point I had entered the Class B airspace without ATC approval. I did not call ATC; I instead focused on both flying the airplane as well as diagnosing the problem. I planned to call ATC once I had resolved the issue. I proceeded with my diagnosis as follows:1) I immediately checked all EGT's and CHT's made records of the readings; and found the readings from the left engine to be in the same range as the right engine. This I believe ruled out the possibility of an immediate engine failure; however; I wanted to continue to try and understand the reading before I made the decision to return to either airport. If I had been IMC I would have made the immediate decision to return to Falcon Field. 2) I switched the left engine fuel source to AUX (in order to determine whether or not I had a fuel pump failure); and the left fuel flow returned to normal (reading approximately 22.5 GPH). I left the left engine fuel flow configuration in AUX's tank mode for approximately two minutes and all appeared normal. 3) I then switched the left engine fuel source back to main and the computer fuel flow reading was normal. The fuel flow anomaly was no longer present. All three of these diagnostics allowed me to believe that the most likely source of the low fuel flow reading was either a semi-broke wire on the fuel transducer and or a failing transducer. I again check the left engine CHT's and EGT's and found them to be in the same range of the left engine. The aircraft will be sent to maintenance to check the fuel flow transducer. At this point in time I had transitioned to the next step in the Phoenix Class B (6000 FT) and I was under the airspace ceiling. Again; the unauthorized incursion into the Class B airspace was for the sole purpose of getting some additional altitude in case of a left engine failure and having to operating the C310T on a hot day in Phoenix with it single engine performance characteristics. As indicated I had passed into the next ring of the Class B airspace. Recognizing that I had violated the airspace; I had planned to call PHX TRACON upon my arrival in Prescott (provided that I had no further fuel flow problems for I would have immediately returned to Scottsdale). After about six to eight minutes of flight I observed that the fuel flow computer was performing normally. EGT's and CHT's were in line and I made the decision to proceed to Prescott. The rest of the flight was uneventful; both to Prescott; then back to Falcon Field. No further fuel flow glitches were observed. Upon starting to make my approach for the ILS to Runway 21L; Prescott Tower asked me to call Albuquerque Center for a message. ABQ Center asked me to call Phoenix TRACON upon my landing; which I did. Phoenix TRACON told me that I had violated their airspace upon departure; I acknowledged that I did; and explained my reasoning (the full above scenario) regarding the fuel flow issue.

I was instructed to turn left on Taxiway D then left on Runway 36 and to turn right on Taxiway H. I explained I was unfamiliar with the airport and the Controller told me to taxi up on Runway 36 and to take Taxiway H to the right. We taxied forward on Runway 36 looking ahead. We did not see a taxiway sign for H and we crossed Runway 24L. As we were crossing Runway 24L I told the Controller that we were still looking for Taxiway H. The Controller told us to make a 180 degree turn and I asked for clearance to cross Runway 24L. I told the Controller we did not see a sign for Taxiway H while on Runway 36; but we saw one coming back on Runway 18. There was no conflict and rest of taxi was uneventful. This showed the importance of using airport diagram and not depending solely on controllers. I also realized that I was more tired than I realized. This occurred after a multi-day trip that originated in Mexico with family and made many stops. I decided to leave the airplane in Dayton and continue by car with friends until I had sufficient time to rest. I feel this was a combination of exhaustion; depending on the controller when I stated that I was unfamiliar with the airport and not stopping the aircraft to locate our position on the airport diagram. I saw the Runway 24L sign but it did not register that I had not received a specific clearance to cross until I was already crossing -- exhaustion.",,,,"Fatigued pilot at DAY found himself confused as to his location and relying heavily on ATC progressive taxi instructions rather than utilizing an airport diagram.",

As I recall the timing of events; I was under Cleveland Center control at the time and was on an approximate 290 degree heading and deviating around obvious thunderstorm cells easily viewed on NEXRAD some 20 nautical miles northwest of Toledo; Ohio. In less than a second I found the aircraft in a 90-degree bank and descending over 1000 FT per minute. This event was accompanied by unexpected heavy rain. After leveling the wings I found myself on an approximate 90-degree heading; and at 11;200 FT altitude. Once stabilized on this heading and regaining the assigned 12;000 FT altitude I asked for the re-route to gain time to assess weather and the best course of action. I was handed off to Detroit Approach Control and they assigned 10;000 FT altitude and granted request to direct Ann Arbor and then direct destination. At the time of the event I was navigating in part on NEXRAD images on my moving map to avoid as much precipitation as possible; At the time of the event I was clear of all precipitation on the moving map over ten miles in any direction. There were isolated thunderstorms across a wide area of Michigan and Ohio. At this time and it appears in my judgment that I likely entered a building cell that was not referenced on NEXRAD image less than 5 minutes old. Crossing this frontal boundary again; I would request even more significant deviations and remain at an altitude that allowed visual conditions as much as practical. As additional follow up; I train yearly with type-specific instructor and I believe this instruction allowed me to regain control of the aircraft and assess the aircraft loss of control as expeditiously as possible. I also want to thank ATC for providing efficient help in re-routing in what was a busy day near DTW airspace. This flight concluded with further deviations throughout the flight. As I flew past Green Bay; build-ups began in earnest again and I climbed to 16;000 FT to maintain visual separation from clouds. Again with significant deviations from 'direct' flight plan; I was able to maintain clearance from thunderstorms obvious through the aircraft windscreen and on NEXRAD.  Although canceling the flight with Minneapolis Center while still airborne the Controller did not receive cancellation and a phone call was required to close out flight plan.",,,,"A Columbia 400 pilot related their misadventures using NEXRAD and its derivatives to navigate near thunderstorms.",

At the time of departure we received an arrival flight strip estimating ZZZ1 XA42Z.  The A-Side controller delivered the arrival strip along with a NOTAM indicating a closed runway at ZZZ1 Runway 18/36.  To prevent the pilot from making the trip all the way to ZZZ1 I had the FLM (Flight Line Manager) call ZZZ1 airport to get more information on the runway closure.  It was possible it could be a short time closed due to snow and ice removal and could be reopened upon his arrival.  The FLM made two attempts to call the facility; but received a voice recording each time.  Aircraft X checked on at six thousand feet with pilots discretion to four thousand feet.  I relayed all pertinent NOTAMS including the Runway 18/36 closed; and asked if he knew anything about the runway closure.  He stated he didn't and I asked him if he wanted to switch to UNICOM to see if he could find out for himself.  Aircraft X replied he was unable to get a hold of any airport personnel and wanted to continue inbound. After a second attempt from Aircraft X to contact any airport personnel; I asked his intentions.  Aircraft X wanted an ILS Runway 36 due to weather.  At this time I was coordinating with my D-side about the options we had as controllers.  We asked the FLM and the response we received was we could offer him a 'Restricted low approach'.  Upon hearing this; I cleared Aircraft X for a 'Restricted low approach ILS Runway 36'; the pilot read back the clearance and then I added; 'Runway 18/36 is NOTAMED closed; along with giving him missed approach instructions.  After his approach he stated he was in communication with the airport personnel and was told the runway would be open shortly.  Aircraft X indicated he wanted another ILS 36 approach and waited for the NOTAM to be cancelled.  After the NOTAM was cancelled I cleared Aircraft X for the ILS Runway 36.  Upon landing; Aircraft X gave me a PIREP and cancelled his flight plan. After reviewing the situation I do not believe the information I received was correct.  Since we didn't have communication with airport or ground personnel I don't believe authorization for a low approach should be granted.  I am not aware at what point the pilot of Aircraft X had communication with airport personnel.  If you clear an aircraft for an approach at a closed runway; you need to have concurrence from ground personnel.  Otherwise; one should withhold the approach clearance; Restate the applicable NOTAM; and advise the operation would be at their (pilot's) own risk.",,,,"ARTCC Controller chronicles a debate on whether an aircraft can be cleared for an approach to a NOTAMED closed runway if go around altitude restrictions are issued.",

While I was tracking to what I believed to be the 34R localizer I was told by SLC Approach Control that I had flown past the localizer. She told me to cancel the approach clearance and gave me a new heading and altitude to climb to so she could get me around to try the approach again; which I complied with. As she routed me with vectors the second time I was told to intercept the localizer 34R again. The same thing happened the second time. I was told by the controller that I had flown past the localizer course again. She asked me if I could see the runway. I told her I had the runway in sight and she cleared me for a visual approach for Runway 34R. But she told me I was lined up for 34L. She then cleared me for Runway 34L visual approach; handed me off the Tower Controller who cleared me to land 34L; which I did. These deviations were a result of a navigation equipment input error. During the initial approach into SLC I was told I would be routed to Runway 17; so I loaded the approach into the G1000 system. Later; as I was told I'd be using the ILS 34R approach; I loaded the ILS 34R approach into the G1000 system. It is my habit to inspect the localizer frequency that the G1000 loads automatically into the system after the approach is selected; to ensure that it has loaded the correct frequency; but I did not do this for these approaches. If I had; I would have seen that the G1000 retained the localizer frequency for the ILS 17 approach instead of the correct ILS 34R localizer frequency. This caused me to deviate from the Controller's instruction to intercept the ILS 34R localizer.",,,,"A C400 pilot was unsuccessfully vectored twice to intercept an ILS approach after which the pilot discovered the frequency for the ILS to a parallel runway was still tuned in his GPS navigation system.",

Shortly after reaching cruise altitude of 5500 FT a large amount of oil was observed flowing over the right engine cowling.  I immediately diverted to closest airport.  While enroute I observed the engine was still operating within normal temperature and oil pressure limits; but I was concerned the engine would eventually stop and/or the oil might ignite on the hot exhaust system so I chose to shut down and feather the right engine.  I continued uneventfully and landed.  The local A&P checked the engine which still contained 8 quarts of oil.  The source of the oil turned out to be a loose oil fill cap.  After adding 4 quarts of oil; we test ran the engine; it was developing full power and operating normally.  Since the shut down occurred before any abnormal temperatures or performance was observed; it was determined that no damage had occurred.  I did not declare an emergency; however I had tuned in the nearest ATC frequency just in case I needed to call for assistance.  I also tried to raise the local Unicom to let them know I was coming; but I couldn't raise them.  When I added a quart of oil to the right engine just before departure; I believe that I forgot to put the cap back on.  My standard practice is to lay the fill cap/dip stick on top of the cowling so I don't forget it; however on this airplane the dip stick and oil fill cap are separate.  The oil fill cap is on a short chain attached to the engine.  When loose; the restraint keeps from losing the cap; but it also keeps it out of sight.

The same Controller then cleared me from a 360 heading and 3;000 FT from a roughly 4 mile right downwind for 16L visual approach to Manassas 16L. He told me to contact the Tower and again; said I was cleared for the approach to 16L.

The MSAW/CA goes off incessantly; rendering it useless.",,"This near midair collision occurred during a busy event that may or may not have caused a distraction to the local ATC operators. Nearly 2 dozen VIP's would be coming into Elmendorf AFB near Merrill Field; our local airport was going to be closed via a TFR for half the day. Many aircraft were trying to leave the field before the closure. Merrill Field is one of the busiest general aviation airports in the world. It has several published arrivals and departure procedures with transitions through the military approach and through Anchorage Class C airspace.I was inbound receiving VFR radar services from ANC Approach using a discrete transponder code. The Part 93 requirement is to fly through the are where the AFB's localizer approach passes through the Merrill Segment below 600 FT MSL or between 2;200 FT - 2;500 FT MSL. The military aircraft operate on the localizer between 900 FT and 1;700 FT.I had advised ANC Approach I would need to transition Merrill's airspace at 2;200 FT without landing for a survey mission. I believe this was relayed to the Local Tower via landline and I was instructed to contact Merrill Tower. The Tower frequency was very congested. Sometime within the next 30 seconds the TCAD (Traffic and Collision Alert Device) in my aircraft alerted me to a conflict. The TCAD is 1970's vintage. It offers an audible alert and textual message in 100's of feet of a conflict.Conditions were VFR but the sun was in my field of vision as I headed east. I wore a ball cap and sunglasses to mask the glare of the sun. At the sound of the TCAD horn; I looked all about and located a C172 which was level and close enough such that I couldn't see the entire aircraft because its entire surface encompassed more than was visible through the windows of our C320. The C172 was coming from my right less then 100 FT away just slightly ahead and nearly a 90 degree angle. I believe my right door post ant the other aircrafts left front door post blocked the view of each other during the time we were approaching one another. We were both at the appropriate altitude. It was just slightly above my aircraft. I could not see the occupants because their silhouettes were masked by the interior headliner. In other words; there was no sky behind them from my perspective.I reacted within less than a second by pushing forward hard on my controls. We use a cargo net in our aircraft and wear seatbelts; but my operator had a laptop out which struck the ceiling. This second crewmember in the right rear seat never saw the other aircraft and I don't believe it reacted to us.Since the incident; I have paced off the distance from which I first observed the C172 and found it to be between 60 and 100 FT. If the C172 I paced from was parked on the ground it was too low to resemble what I say during the incident. I located an amphibian Cessna and found the height to be realistic. This put the fuselage about 6 to 8 feet above my line of sight.I contacted the Tower via telephone upon landing and spoke with the Supervisor. I explained the details to him. He said he could review the radar loop from the ACN Approach radar. The radar at Merrill is allocated from the Tower at ANC International.

On the way there; an IFR flight plan was filed. We left with auxiliary tanks topped off and roughly 20 GAL per side in the main tanks (tip tanks in the 310). Upon arrival at destination; we decided that it would be safe to add 5 GAL per side into the main (tip) tanks. The flight back was conducted in VFR conditions between 2;500 and 3;000 FT. The flight took roughly 30 minutes; of which 15-20 minutes were fueled from the auxiliary (wing) tanks. After preparing for landing; the tanks were switched back to mains; as required by the checklist. Between 1 and 2 miles from the airport; the left engine experienced momentary roughness; however; as all of the gauges were in the green; I continued the approach. The approach was conducted at a slightly higher than recommended speed and altitude; to compensate for the heavy winds that were reported (information at the time reported around 15G23 out of 070). Once the landing was assured; with the gear and flaps already down; power was reduced. Approximately 1;000 FT from the Runway threshold; my passenger and I smelled a heavy aroma of AVGAS in the cockpit. Approximately 150 FT from; and about 20-30 FT above; the threshold; I experienced a failure in the port engine (the critical engine). Having very little time to react; I added some power to the right engine; instantly realizing that at our low; pre-touchdown speed; this would cause the plane to bank and become uncontrollable. Power was taken out; and within 2 seconds I landed the plane on the threshold. Fearing a fuel leak; the port engine had been shut down almost instantly; and the starboard engine was shut down upon reaching the runway. Using inertia; I made a right turn onto the taxiway; stopping the aircraft over the hold short line. With Ground's permission; we disembarked and pushed the plane completely over the hold short line. I was; within no more than two seconds before touching down; able to make a non-distress call to the Tower stating 'engine failure.'

I was to meet my wife at the destination to mediate our impending divorce.  I probably should not have flown but angry dissension with my wife made it impossible for us to drive together.]I checked the weather in the morning and determined that the flight could be accomplished.  Rain was forecast for that evening but the plan was to only be there for an hour meeting so it was reasonable to expect that the return trip would also be doable from a weather perspective; so I completed the outbound flight.  The one hour meeting quickly turned into four or more and ended with both my wife and I emotionally spent.  I offered to drive her home and leave the plane at the airport but she angrily demanded I get out of her car and leave her alone.I no longer had a ride home and it was my responsibility to pick up kids.  We had just been in heated mediation sessions where my wife had claimed I was a dead-beat dad; an absentee husband; and a terrible father.  I had an unbelievable urge inside to demonstrate that was not true and picking up the kids on time became my single focus.  I also knew the weather was going to get worse that night and it was getting dark soon so the added pressure of the loss of daylight and decrease in temperatures and lowering of the freezing level were factors that I allowed to pressure me into a hurried decision.Just over two years prior my next door neighbor had killed himself along with 3 passengers in that exact same terrain in a CFIT scenario that was weather related.  Even though I knew I could be susceptible to this type of accident I still attempted to scud run and avoid the freezing layer above and the terrain below.  I rationalized that there were several airports along the way where I could divert. I rationalized that with my experience and the onboard terrain avoidance TAWS-B and weather datalink that I should be able to make it through the pass and stay out of the ice and avoid the terrain or at least make a 180 degree turn back to an airport I had already passed.I knew that accidents can and do happen but never really believed that it could happen to me and this is unfortunately a classic demonstration of the hazardous 'invulnerability attitude.'  I allowed my extreme focus and fixation on the end objective of landing on time so I could pick my kids up to completely cloud my judgment and cause me to disregard any other course of action.I clearly used scud running techniques to avoid ice and maneuver around terrain which increased the risk of a safe flight.  I did not think climbing was an option because of PIREPs of moderate icing by airliners in the vicinity of the route I was flying.  As a result; at the worst possible moment when maneuvering near terrain in a mountain pass; I continued my VFR flight into IMC.  I didn't attempt a 180 degree turn because of terrain on both sides of the aircraft although I did execute a climb of about 400-500 FT where I was able to resume VFR flight once clear of clouds and maintained VFR for the remainder of the flight to my home airport.So; several factors played into this incident which could have resulted in the loss of my aircraft and my life in a CFIT accident.  It CAN happen to me.  Clearly it can; and it almost did.  I will monitor myself and not allow a flight to be considered under such extreme circumstances.  I will keep the aircraft on the ground and evaluate alternative courses of action before attempting a flight with high risk associated with it.  I will know that this time of my life as I go through a divorce; and any other high stress times in my life; may lead to future poor decisions.  I will guard against this by recognizing it early and taking corrective action.  I will avoid the scenarios that could lead to risky flights and I will build better alternatives into my planning and execute those plans when faced with high risk flight.",,,,"An emotionally distressed pilot of a CE400 allowed outside factors to coerce into flying a flight in conditions which resulted in flight into IMC conditions and the very real potential for CFIT.",

Gear extension cycle seemed otherwise normal. I checked the indicator bulb to verify that the bulb was not burned out. Gear was cycled four times without resolving the situation; Instructor on board cross-checked my actions. Operating manual was referenced to very correct emergency extension procedures. Manual pump was actuated. Problem was not resolved. Based on the gear design; it was fairly certain that the main gear was down and locked. At issue was whether or not the front gear was down and locked. I then executed a low-level flyby of an airport with a Tower. Their visual observation was that the gear appeared to be in the normal extended position. I then decided to make a precautionary landing at that airport instead of returning to my home base. The reason for this decision was that better emergency equipment was available and the clear area to either side of the runway was greater than at my home field. The shorter runway at selected airport was best aligned with the wind. Length was 3;800 FT. First approach involved idle power on front engine only to verify that rear engine power alone was sufficient to maintain a safe approach. After the successful completion of that step; I entered an approximate two mile final; shut down the front engine and feathered and leveled the prop. The purpose was to reduce the risk of damage to the prop or the front engine in the event of a nose gear collapse. Landing was made uneventfully. Gear held in the down position. Initial inspection of the aircraft by my regular mechanic showed that all three gear were in fact down and locked. Next step is to analyze gear down and locked electrical signal to determine if a switch has failed.",,,,"A C337's landing gear indicated unsafe with the gear down so the pilot declared an emergency; diverted to an airport with a wide runway; feathered the front propeller and landed safely with emergency equipment standing by.",

I was afraid the Cessna 300 was going to be traffic for the limited data block aircraft. FAY said that he was staying at 060 FT. Since I had other duties to perform; IFR handoffs and coordination; I was splitting my time between that situation and the rest of my duties. Shortly thereafter; the Cessna 300 said he saw an aircraft pass 400 FT below him; and sounded very concerned about it. Since I still did not have a full data block associated with the Cessna 300; I was having difficulty trying to see what just happened.

Subsequent discussion with FAY TRACON revealed that the VFR aircraft with the same code that they were working; had told them he would stay below 10;000. Regardless; I needed a point out from FAY so I could tell my aircraft that. They also said that their guy had my guy in sight the whole time. That was little comfort to me or the pilot during all of this. Many times a day; especially weekends; numerous VFR aircraft operate parachute operations at several airports FAY controls. These aircraft routinely climb to between 11;000 and 14;500 to initiate the jumps. It happens so fast; that we do not take RADAR handoffs from FAY; rather we accept point outs on the LDB's. In this case; I hadn't received a timely point out on their aircraft; and I did not point out my aircraft to them; even though he was only 500 FT above their upper airspace limit. Had both of us done this; it would have helped; and I might have noticed the fact that both aircraft were on the same squawk.",,,,"ZDC Controller described a conflict event involving a parachute operation aircraft that was on an identical code as another VFR operation causing the data block to 'jump' making the developing conflict difficult to identify.",

After initial contact with Tower at 10 miles out; I was told to expect Runway 28L; and to report at three miles out. I could see both runways at this point; the light-colored Runway 28L; and the dark-colored Runway 28R. At 4 miles out; while flying a heading of about 310; the Controller told me to fly north and to expect to land instead on Runway 28R; as the was now other traffic bound for 28L. Shortly after turning north; I was told by Tower that I was cleared to land on Runway 28R. At this point I had a strong tailwind. I looked left to reacquire 28R visually; and I perceived that I had overshot 28R by a small amount; which I attributed to the tailwind on base. I continued the turn to final to realign with what I perceived to be 28R; and continued on to land on the runway. During the rollout; I informed Tower where I would like to park; and the Controller requested that I turn right on Taxiway G and hold short of 28R. She then informed me of a possible pilot deviation. It was at this point that I realized that I had landed on the wrong runway. Factors that may have contributed to this could have included: 1) the relative infrequency of my flying to this airport; 2) the last minute request to change from 28L to 28R; while so close to the airport; 3) the fact that I apparently lost visual perception of 28R during turn from base to final; which I suspect may be related to it's darker color; and its blending into the surroundings; 4) my preconception that with a tailwind on base; I might overshoot the runway. In the future; especially with parallel runways; I will: 1) be particularly vigilant to confirm visually that I am aligned with the correct runway; 2) load the instrument approach; if available; so that I can have a localizer reference to either runway; 3) be sure to make a lasting mental note to runway variations in color or other visual cues; 4) be sure to confirm visually that I actually see the numbers; and R or L; when on short final.",,,,"Confused by the Tower's changes in landing runway assignments and experiencing difficulty in maintaining visual awareness of the two parallel runways as distinct from long; more clearly defined parallel taxiways; the pilot of a Cessna 400 landed on Runway 28L at FCM instead of 28R as cleared.",

The ATIS reported clear sky and winds calm; and although my direction of flight would be to the south; I was monitoring the CTAF and heard traffic using Runway 34; so I decided to use 34 and I taxied to the runway. My passenger was a pilot who I knew as a fellow board member of our local flying association; but we had not flown together before this. About 15 feet from the runway hold-short lines; where I performed the run-up and final preflight checks; I heard two other pilots on CTAF. One reported on downwind for Runway 34; another reported 5 miles south planning Runway 34. I observed the airplane on downwind. I taxied to the hold short lines; paused; looked both ways and said to myself; 'no traffic on final; nothing on the runway.' It is relevant that I could not actually see clearly all the way to the end of the 6;000 FT runway due to bright sun and glare; although I was wearing amber sunglasses. I was aware of my pilot-passenger looking down the runway as well; he made no comment and we were no longer chatting once I crossed the hold short lines. I reported taking Runway 34 for a left downwind departure; rolled onto the runway; powered up and rotated about 1/3 of the way down the runway. At 50-100 FT AGL I was surprised to see a high-wing single-engine airplane at the same altitude climbing in the opposite direction--evidently having just taken off from Runway 16. I immediately turned to my right; banking about 15 degrees; and within a few seconds we had passed one another with about 20 feet horizontal clearance. I returned wings level to resume a normal climb on course. Immediately after we were clear; we both remarked that we had not heard the other pilot transmitting on CTAF and we were amazed that someone would takeoff opposite the traffic and without talking to traffic. I transmitted on CTAF; 'Yolo County traffic; be advised there is an airplane that just took off Runway 16; not on frequency.' I next heard on the radio; 'I am on frequency.' I next heard another voice on the radio: 'I heard him report.' I said; 'I didn't hear him.' I next heard from the opposite direction pilot; 'We almost had 2 dead pilots there.'I completed the flight; and afterward reflected about what happened and factors that might have contributed to the situation. To explain why I did not hear the other pilot report his takeoff; if he actually did; I can only speculate that perhaps we were transmitting at the same time and that's why I did not hear him (and; presumably; he did not hear me). Other possible contributing factors: I was not anticipating that anyone would be taking off on the opposite runway even though winds were calm because all other traffic were using Runway 34. Also; I was feeling casual and chatting somewhat with my passenger; and while I felt I was attentive to my duties and was definitely listening on the radio; I was not maintaining a 'sterile cockpit' which would have meant zero extraneous conversation and less potential distraction.",,,,"A Cessna 350 pilot departing from a non-towered airport suffered an NMAC with a high wing single taking off opposite direction from the same runway.

I was contacted by ATC to follow the DP which was no longer in my flight plan-they proceeded to give me a heading and altitude to which I immediately complied. I am still not quite sure how the DP was deleted; however; I have realized that I should also load the chart for the DP on my charts page of the MFD which would have given me immediate reference to the procedure.The event occurred in VMC; I was fully in control of the aircraft and at no time was I at risk. I fly into and out of Teterboro often and want to be certain this does not occur again. I have taken corrective procedural action to ensure it does not. On departure I will always load the DP into the flight plan; load the chart into the charts page; have the chart active on the iPad and have my heading bug and altitude indicator set on the appropriate numbers for the first phase of the DP. I have run this scenario through my head numerous times as it was disconcerting to err in such a busy flight environment.I plan on pursuing my CFI in the spring of 2013 and feel that although this was a failure on my part; much was gained and learned.

The airplane is in annual; pitot/static check current; equipment certified for actual IFR use. I am a current FAR Pt. 121 Captain for an Air Carrier. Daytime VFR conditions existed at Modesto and in the entire region. I contacted NORCAL in VMC conditions approximately 30 NM east of MOD and requested multiple ILS Runway 28R approaches while remaining under VFR conditions. I was given a discrete transponder code; asked if I had current ATIS; and given a vector to intercept localizer. I inquired about missed approach procedures; knowing that frequently we are turned in the opposite direction to published procedures for training work. My reply was something like 'you can determine that later'. That seemed peculiar to me; and impossible to pre plan for. I became concerned the NORCAL Controller was confused regarding my intentions to shooting practice ILS approaches; so I asked the NORCAL Controller 'did you coordinate with Modesto Tower?' As we were speaking; I was travelling towards the Modesto Class D Airspace at a speed that would cause me to enter their airspace in roughly 60 seconds. The NORCAL Controller became what I cannot describe better than angry with me and told me to 'worry about flying the plane and wait for me to hand you off!' What he could have done was provided me with correct missed approach directions so I knew he understood my initial request. After an uneventful approach and return for another; another NORCAL Controller told me to 'squawk 1200 when you complete this approach' so I asked him; 'do I need to contact you when I cancel?' and again I received a verbal lashing for asking a question. All the Controller needed to say is 'upon completion of this approach squawk 1200 and no need to re-contact me'. Instead he insulted me for asking him. I am a Boeing 717 Captain for an airline. I can guarantee if these NORCAL controllers had behaved this way to an airline crew; they would have generated a safety report. Why do general aviation pilots have to put up with abusive behavior? Does the FAA condone unprofessional behavior of their controllers? My ego was not bruised; but if any students are intimidated into not asking valid questions during their contact with NORCAL TRACON; I see a real safety issue. Maybe I just caught these guys on a bad day?

There were numerous itinerant arrivals as well as multiple pattern players that were either landing and ending their pattern work or departing the area. There was also a few aircraft waiting to depart. A PC12 called inbound from the west of Chino. I knew he parked on the north side of the airport but I had multiple aircraft tagged up coming to Runway 26R; the north runway; from the north and east. I cleared him to land Runway 26L and he did with out incident. When he exited the runway; he turned north; between the parallel runways. I instructed him to hold short of Runway 26R and remain on my frequency; which is standard procedure at Chino. He read back 'Hold short Runway 26R; PC12' I believe that is an improper read back as it only had the final two digits of his call sign instead of three. I only realized it was a bad read back because I had to pull the voice recorded data for the events that followed.  The PC12 did as he was instructed and held short of Runway 26R without incident; but I failed to get a proper read back from him. As this was happening I had multiple other aircraft demanding my attention. One of these was the C400; inbound from the south. I knew the C400 parked on the north side of the airport but due to the traffic already sequenced to Runway 26R I issued him a left base entry for Runway 26L. He read this back properly with the runway identifier. A minute or so later after dealing with other aircraft I sequenced the C400 to follow an aircraft in left closed traffic and cleared him to land. He read this back correctly with runway identifier. By this point two aircraft were waiting to depart Runway 26R; the second of which was the C172. There were also three aircraft landing Runway 26R. I then issued the C400 an updated position of the aircraft he was to follow. I did not include anything about the runway in this transmission; and the C400 responded that he did not have the aircraft in sight. There was sufficient spacing between the second arrival and the third to clear the two aircraft waiting to depart for take off with reduced same runway separation. Had everything gone as planned the C400 would have landed on Runway 26L and would have taxied behind the PC12. They would have been able to cross Runway 26R after the third arrival. Things did not go as planned as the C400 turned final to land on Runway 26R; and I did not see he had done so. As I scanned short final and the runway before clearing the C172 for take off; I saw the C400 but I did not realize his mistake. I cleared the C172 for take off as I double checked my same runway separation with the first departure and once again scanned short final. The C172 read back his clearance; and as he had been waiting to leave for about 3 minutes; started moving immediately. The C172 crossed the hold bar of Runway 26R as I realized the C400 was less then a quarter mile on final; lined up for the wrong runway on his final descent to the runway. I immediately issued go around instructions for the C400 twice. I also told the C172 to stop. I used improper phraseology here regarding the C172 I believe my actual words were 'C400; Go around. C400; Go around C172 STOP!; C400; Go around!' The C172 heard the urgency in my words and stopped before crossing the white runway edge lines but was in the safety area. I never properly cancelled his take off clearance or told him to hold short. The C400 started his go around climb prior to the threshold but did not verbally acknowledge the go around until he was passed the threshold and about 200 FT up in his climb. I was tying up the frequency shouting for him to go around so I think that was the earliest the C400 could respond and verbally acknowledge my instructions. I am fairly certain had I not noticed and taken corrected action the C400 would have landed on top of the C172 as the C172 lined up for his takeoff roll. I then resolved the remaining situation re-sequenced andcleared the C400 to land after the third arrival; who was still on downwind. I re-issued a takeoff clearance for the C172; once the C400 was no longer a factor. I gave the position to another Controller using proper procedure and checked the tapes of the incident. The C400 read back all of my instructions but failed to follow them; as I have related. Regarding the PC12; I just need to work harder on analyzing read backs. I also think more pilot literature; I.E. safety bulletins; stressing the importance of a read back with three digits of the call sign would be helpful. I believe the pilot of the PC12 believed he gave a good read back. He also did do as instructed to obviously he understood my instructions. As for the C400 I am not sure what can be done. This was an honest mistake. He wanted to land Runway 26R. He was used to landing that runway most often. He was instructed to land the parallel runway due to traffic and read it back. Yet he did what he wanted to do rather then what he was instructed to do and lined up for the wrong runway. I wish I had noticed the problem sooner and either had him land before clearing the C172 to depart or issue him a go around/corrective instruction at an earlier point. However our RADAR does not have that level of clarity and the visual difference out the window of a small aircraft landing Runway 26R and one landing Runway 26L is pretty small until they get within half a mile of the runway. I will be much more careful for that in the future; but there was nothing in my mind to indicate a problem. So when I saw the C400 on final for the first time out the window I thought he was doing as instructed and it was only on my second evaluation that I realized there was a problem. I will try to do better in the future; but I believe reevaluating and spotting these situations is what I am there for. And I am glad I did because I do think it could have resulted in a collision had I not sent the C400 around. Regarding the improper phraseology I used to stop the C172; I let my emotions over a very scary situation override my training. I knew the proper phraseology and have used it before; but I did not use it. Instead I used the clearer and direct 'STOP!' The C172 got the message and stopped. Again I am not sure what I could do better other then being more experience with dealing with dangerous situations. The more of them I see; the better I get at overriding my emotions and following procedure; however I would much rather not experience dangerous situations in the first place.",,,,"CNO Controller described a wrong parallel runway landing attempt requiring a last minute go around instruction; the reporter providing a number of improvements expected as more experience is gained.",

A contributing actor was the stress of a long work day due to weather.There was an airline flight inbound and made me feel rushed to get on the ground and cancel IFR so they could start the approach. After cleared for the approach I made multiple radio calls on the incorrect frequency inbound to the airport.Upon breaking out of the clouds the approach lights appeared to be on high setting and the approach was continued on visual from about a 1.25 miles out. About 0.5 miles from the runway I saw yellow vehicle beacons and headlights near the arrival end of the runway. I continued the approach to landing even though the vehicles looked like they where closer than the hold short line. I did decide to land long not knowing the how close the vehicles where to the runway and not seeing any other vehicle lights the rest of the length of runway.

Weather conditions were good VFR with visibility at least 10 miles and scattered clouds well above the altitudes we were training at. The winds were less than 6 KTS to light and variable from the southeast. The take off was normal. After lifting off; I selected the flaps up; and when no runway was available for landing I selected gear up. Continued on runway heading to 1;000 FT before turning downwind. Reduced power to 16' MP and props to 2;400 RPM. On downwind; performed the landing checklist GUMP. I checked the fuel selectors were on the main tanks; selected the gear down and confirmed three green lights orally (the Inspector confirmed as well); mixtures were already forward and moved the prop levers to full forward. I remember reaching to select flaps 15 degrees. Turned base leg and noticed I was starting to get to low and added power to arrest the descent between 500 and 600 FT. Speed control remained constant at about 120-125 mph from the time gear was selected down thru final approach. After arresting the descent; I performed a final GUMP check noting that the gear lights were still three green. There were no abnormal indications at any time through out the pattern and approach. When I turned final approach; the VASI showed that I was high on the approach. I began reducing power; approach speed remained constant between 120 - 125 mph. As I approached the end of the runway; I reduced the power to idle (heard no gear horn come on) and flared for the landing. In the flare; I noticed I had flared high and let the plane settle slightly before I continued the flare. The next thing I knew we were sliding on the belly of the airplane and skidded to a stop just short of the intersection. Smoke began coming into the cockpit center forward. The Inspector said Fire! Fire! Fire! and exited the aircraft. I shut off the mixture and prop controls; magnetos; alternators and master switch and exited the aircraft. No fire occurred and there were no injuries. I called the Control Tower to tell them what had happened and call FSS to cancel our VFR flight plan. No emergency was declared by me. Recovery operations began to clear the runway and move the aircraft back into the hangar.","The reporter believes that the only possible explanation for the gear up landing is that the gear handle was inadvertently moved to the up position during the second 'GUMP' check on base and was not detected by either pilot.","While conducting a PIC check in a Cessna 310; it was involved in a gear up landing. There were no injuries to either occupant. Both occupants were wearing seat belts and shoulder harness with no PPE. The aircraft suffered prop strikes; sudden stoppage to the engines; abrasions to all 4 exhaust augmenters; deformation of the rear ventral fin; and several antenna' on belly destroyed.Events up to the eventful landing were as follows: A normal takeoff and normal left hand traffic pattern was flown with no simulated emergencies in place. The pattern appeared normal until touchdown. The gear was lowered abeam the numbers and a 'GUMPS (gear; undercarriage; mixture; props; switches)' check was announced by the pilot and I confirmed 3 green gear down lights were illuminated and stated 'confirmed'. We continued around the pattern and the pilot again announced another 'GUMPS' check which was completed just prior to making the base to final turn and I again confirmed three green gear down lights and stated 'confirmed'. The approach segment on left base initially was flat and slightly low which the pilot corrected for by leveling off and adding power verbalizing what he was seeing and doing. The final approach segment was stable and looked like it would terminate at the round out between the runway aim point markers. The round out was slightly high and the aircraft floated a little higher than normal. The touchdown segment was a little high and had the gear been down would have been a firm landing. Since the gear wasn't down it was a firm landing on the exhaust augmenters with a skid of approximately 1;200 to 1;500 FT coming to rest just shy of the intersecting runway. When the aircraft skidded to a stop it was immediately vacated due to smoke filling the cockpit. During the skidding portion I declared a few expletives. After it stopped and the cabin started filling with smoke; I declared 'Fire!; Fire!; Fire!; evacuate; evacuate; evacuate!' Upon this declaration we evacuated through the passenger door and proceeded to the right rear area behind the airplane.The PIC then called the Tower by cell phone and reported the mishap and fire/rescue arrived. Pictures were taken and the aircraft placed on a dolly with additional damage to the ventral fin sustained in the transportation efforts. The aircraft has not been touched on the inside and is in the hangar.",,"C310 pilot with inspector aboard reports a gear up landing after twice confirming during the approach that the gear indicated down with three green lights.",

The fluctuation was not immediately resolved by switching to the auxiliary fuel tank; which had over 30 gallons of fuel; and engaging the electric boost pump. As the airport was less than 2 miles away; and as I had ample altitude; I felt the safest course of action was to return to the airport; and diagnose the problem on the ground. I notified ATC of an engine problem; and requested a return to land. To facilitate the single engine landing and reduce drag; I shut down the right engine and feathered the propeller. The landing was uneventful; and I taxied to the maintenance facility. It appears that the low fuel level in the right main tank at climb attitude permitted air to enter the fuel pump inlet resulting in cavitations of the pump. The fuel flow from the auxiliary tank did not have adequate time to purge the air and prime the fuel pump as I elected to shut the right engine down to facilitate an immediate landing. Prevention of a similar event would be accomplished by assuring an adequate fuel level in the main fuel tank. Although there was ample fuel in the auxiliary tank; it would have taken some period of time for the fuel from that tank to have primed the fuel pump and purged the air from the pump such that fuel could be delivered to the engine.",,,,"A pilot shut a C310 engine down after takeoff because of fluctuating fuel flow but after returning he discovered that the main tank fuel pump is uncovered at a high body angle and switching to the auxiliary tank would have alleviated the problem given time.",

I particularly chose this airport because last year flying the same approach under an IFR flight plan and in IMC conditions; the vectoring I received from Indy Center left me so high above the glide slope; I wasn't able to descend fast enough and had to go miss. So I wanted to try this approach again and see if there was anything I needed to learn. After I made radio contact with Indy Center; I asked and received vectors for the ILS RWY 6 approach and was told to remain VFR. When asked how I wanted to end the approach; I notified the Controller; I would fly direct to Mt. Sterling (IOB). Once I started to receive vectors; my altitude was 6;500 MSL. I didn't descend to any lower altitudes; as I was expecting ATC to give me those lower numbers. So when I was ready to intercept the localizer; I was 3;500 feet above the GS. When Indy Center cleared me for the approach he said and I quote; 'You're now on you own and remain VFR; cleared to fly published missed.' This was all ambiguous to me as I was expecting to also hear the words; 'Frequency change approved and return to this frequency.' Also; I was confused why the Controller mentioned flying the published miss; when I had previously told him I wanted to fly direct to IOB. My safety pilot was also confused; but we reasoned; we'll make a frequency change and fly miss anyway; since we were so high above the glide slope. Once we flew the published miss we made two holds over the London VOR and then headed to Mt. Sterling (IOB). Since the Controller said we were on our own; I interpreted those remarks meaning our Flight Following was over. I probably; with that in mind; should have squawked 1200 but for some reason I didn't. I probably as well; should have talked to Indy Center again and clarified everything with the Controller; but again I thought our Flight Following was over.

It was VMC at that time; and although it was not bright sunlight at all yet it was exceedingly clear and easy to see by the light of the pending sunlight. I flew direct to the VOR and as I started to get close to shore and the mountains they held (although I was already higher than the highest point of the mountains there; being above 8;000 FT at the time) and was about to contact ATC I was contacted by them and asked if I was on the departure or direct the VOR. I explained that I was direct the VOR; and he replied that I should be on the Departure and that I should execute an immediate left turn to I think it was 180 degrees (after he confirmed that I could provide my own obstacle avoidance; which I could easily and readily do). A few minutes later he then again contacted me and directed me to call upon landing for a possible deviation (which I did immediately upon landing before even leaving the cockpit as soon as I shut down the plane).As an aside; on that same flight a few minutes later still in the climb with the cabin heat on full; the Carbon Monoxide Alarm (both visual and auditory) in my G1000 went off. I was already wearing oxygen (as I was planning cruise flight at 17;000 FT) so I turned it on full; opened all the vents; and as I was looking for an airport to urgently or; if needed; emergency divert to; the alarm stopped and the red notice disappeared after no more than 60 to 90 seconds. (We had had difficulty with carbon monoxide in this airplane in 2010/2011 and it was finally successfully identified and fixed/repaired at that time; but as a result of my prior repeated carbon monoxide exposure experiences in that plane until it was finally fixed; I immediately knew what to do.) I tried counting serial sevens (a habit I started LONG ago as a pilot in addition to wearing my pulse ox to ensure adequate oxygenation was to continually and repeatedly subtract serial sevens in my head from a randomly chosen five digit number to ensure that I am alert and 'sharp'; especially when I am at altitude/in the flight levels - just as a means of double checking and ensuring my oxygenation status) and found that I had some difficulty doing them (which of course I normally would not have any difficulty executing at all). Whether this was because I was hindered by true relative hypoxia and carbon monoxide exposure or; perhaps the stress of the alarm going off I simply cannot say; I'm afraid. In retrospective review of the events; I clearlyshould have asked for clarification of the clearance if I had any question as to his intent; which I did; yet I did not ask for clarification and this was my mistake and mine alone. At all times the Controller was exceedingly proper and professional and helpful; and this misunderstanding was entirely my own fault. I would love to blame it on being tired; but I had a wonderful night's sleep the night before. I would love to blame it on the Controller; but he was clear and precise and I simply misunderstood. I would love to blame my not thinking clearly and not simply asking for clarification as I normally would and should have done on carbon monoxide exposure; but there is no way that I know for sure that that was the case (I have of course hours ago already requested our A&P to investigate the carbon monoxide issue). Clearly; the learning point here is a) be certain that you fully understand the provided clearance; don't just 'read it back'; and b) if you are not sure; ASK.","The Reporter stated that the call to ATC was productive and treated as a learning event by the controllers. Regarding the carbon monoxide; the Reporter's A & P did not find any leaks and because the cabin's fresh air supply pipes from the turbo; not the exhaust manifold; they are convinced the CO warning was false even though it indicated about 150 ppm.",,,"A Columbia 400 pilot had a track deviation after takeoff because he misunderstood his clearance then had a carbon monoxide warning for which he took environmental clearing procedures for while using oxygen; but believes the warning was false.",

I then returned to the Maintenance Hangar and completed the paperwork and log entries. It was getting late; and past time to go home. I notified the customer that the aircraft was ready. The aircraft flew a few days later in December and the landing gear would not retract properly. The landing gear was selected 'Down' and would not downlock. Two other attempts were made to extend the gear and it finally downlocked. A routine landing was made with no incident. There was some damage to the nose landing gear doors. I believe one section of the job was not completed due to the Mechanic being pulled off to another job. I trusted the Mechanic to do his job; and did not catch the disconnected doors as I pulled the aircraft out of the hangar.

Normally; this type of coordination means ABB sector would have received a point out from HUF prior to transferring control to me. When the 310 was nearly at the ABB/HUF boundary (within 30 sec and 2 NM); ABB called me asking if HUF had coordinated the point out by any chance -- ABB could not reach HUF via any means of communication. I said I would try to call HUF. While I was trying the shout line; ABB switched the 310 to my frequency. The 310 continued through HUF airspace for a few miles then transited my airspace without incident. Meanwhile; my TRACON CIC attempted to establish contact with HUF; but was unsuccessful. After approximately 20 minutes ZID assumed responsibility for HUF's airspace because of a communication issue. Recommendation; the root cause of this incident can better be established from a Tech Ops perspective. However; the high reliability of automation and equipment has established an expectation that all coordination will be accomplished nearly instantaneously. This is a reminder that we should not take procedural due diligence for granted.

As the work progressed the customer kept adding extra jobs to the list; but the time to complete remained the same; also the customer continually reminded me that money was very tight and I should always choose the least expensive option regardless of time indeed; further to that he insisted that he would handle all purchase decisions personally and approve each purchase; this considerably lengthened the completion time. Indeed; I knew within a month of commencement that the completion date was physically impossible for one Mechanic; however; I failed to confront him on this matter as I was intimidated with his manner. Indeed; some conversations consisted of him shouting at me over the phone and all discussions about the project consisted of him talking and me listening.  I failed to retain control of the scope and nature of the repairs and quickly became extremely stressed and physically sick over the pressure placed upon me. Upon beginning work on the plane and engine; I discovered multiple problems and work signed-off as Airworthy which was obviously not. The customer explained to me that he has a relative who has an Inspection Authority (IA) rating who is happy to work for $20 an hour for him and who has been responsible for his plane in the past and that this person said the particular repair in question was Airworthy. I had to add these 'repairs' to my list of I had to 'fix' these repairs. The nature and scope of the project kept expanding with contrary instructions sometimes issued daily with the consequence of the project falling further and further behind. During the course of the project I had received over 300 instructions. Multiple times the project details were verbally changed or amended. I found myself spending inordinate amounts of time in the office on the phone and internet and unable to undertake physical work on the plane. Finally; when the required completion day was five days away; he arrived at my Shop completely unannounced and informed me that he was now taking control of the project and literally camped outside my hangar entrance in his car and used my Shop and office as his own. He has admitted to removing paperwork and items without my knowledge from my shop. With his arrival and scrutiny; I felt even more pressure to complete my obligation to him to the point that in those last four days; I worked almost 55-hours without any sleep; knowing now that because of the situation I would not be getting paid.  Anyway; it was under these circumstances and conditions that I rushed to try to finish the project; I failed to inspect the engine cylinder assemblies for correct configuration and assembly before installing them onto the plane.  I failed to personally supervise unlicensed personnel that worked on the plane in my Shop and I had to correct several issues which further slowed me down. I agreed to install some quickly obtainable; but experimental Push-Pull Control cables. I installed unapproved Stainless Steel (SS) fasteners on the front engine case join; as I could not wait for the AN bolts and nuts to arrive. I had previously researched the tensile strength of Grade 8; AN fasteners at 120;000 LBS tensile strength and installed SS-316 fasteners with a tensile strength of 170;000 LBS instead; as I was exceeding the tensile strength specification I reasoned it was acceptable. When the completion day arrived and the plane was still not ready; he made arrangements to borrow a plane from another Maintenance facility at the airport for his trip abroad and informed me on the same day that as part of that agreement he was removing his plane immediately from my Shop and handing the project over to them. The plane was towed from my Shop an hour later. I attempted to put together a listing of outstanding items for the other Maintenance Shop but again; as I was rushed; this list was incomplete. I attempted to correct it when I remembered other items. However; as Work Order reference paperwork had been removed from my Shop; I was not able to reference much documentation and had to create the entries and lists from memory as far as possible. I was then again pressured over the period of the next days into rushing the logbook entries; as the new Maintenance Shop would not proceed without them and I have unintentionally missed or incorrectly entered several items in those entries.","Reporter stated he has only three years of maintenance experience.

The flight was uneventful until the ending. I misjudged the height of the runway and had a harder than normal landing. After rolling out for a few seconds while commenting to my passenger (a pilot flight instructor/friend who had accompanied me on the trip) about the rough landing; I suddenly was unable to control the plane as it began chattering or 'mini-jumping' on the runway. I yelled at my friend that I thought I had experienced a flat tire due to the very rough handling and almost jumping of the plane. The plane then suddenly veered almost 180 degrees to the left and I found myself at a complete stop; almost facing the direction from which I had come. I then heard another plane being cleared to land behind me; and I actually saw the lights of the approaching plane (on final) heading towards the runway I was still on! I tried contacting the Tower but they did not answer or did not hear me; so I increased the throttle to try to move the plane which then moved smoothly and without ANY shimmy or roughness at all; and immediately headed for the closest exit which was a short back taxi but the closest route off the active runway considering where I was facing and that I thought that the plane would not be easily and/or safely movable after the trouble I had experienced. We succeeded in getting off the active runway and contacted the Tower on the second radio. After getting the plane to the hangar by slow taxi with NO difficulty; we shut it down and discussed the events with the Tower again. We also examined the plane and found a) NO flat tires; but b) a cylindrical bronze colored collar was seen around the nose wheel strut that was greasy; easily moved up and down the strut by hand; and contained threads within it that apparently were supposed to be attached/threaded to a received that was located higher in the nose wheel assembly and to which it was (obviously) no longer attached. Further; I gently pushed the nose of the aircraft (while standing at its left side) to the right and it appeared as if the entire nose wheel assembly was loose and wobbled to the right as the plane did slightly displace to the right. I have; of course; contacted our A&P to examine the plane in general and the nose wheel assembly in particular to determine what went wrong and how to repair whatever might have occurred.I do not know if this report should or should not be filed; but as it involved back taxiing on an active runway without permission but doing so because of the sudden incapacitation and loss of control of the aircraft following a rough landing and seeing a plane on approach and being unable to raise the Tower and wanting to ensure that I got off the active as soon as possible yet not being able to declare this as an emergent situation; I thought that if it might help clarify how to proceed for others in the future; it would be worth filing.",,,,"After a firm landing during which the nose gear was damaged the pilot of a Cessna Columbia 400 hastened to exit the runway due to following traffic cleared to land behind him.

The Gasket Set included two O-rings for each fuel injector; however I made the mistake that both O-rings were to be used on this engine. The Teledyne-Continental IO-550 engine (non turbocharged) only requires one O-ring; the exact same cylinder is on a TSIO-550 (Turbocharged) engine and it requires two O-rings. However; the same fuel injector is run on both Turbocharged and Non-turbocharged engines. There is a groove for two O-rings and I mistakenly installed two O-rings on the Non-turbocharged engine.

After a period of time longer than the normal gear retraction period; a green gear down light was observed; along with a nose gear extended visually in the mirror on the left nacelle.  When pushing the PTT transmit button on the pilot-side yoke the avionics stack browned out.  Additionally; the gear indication lights now no longer illuminated to confirm gear down or gear unsafe.  Bulb swaps; and testing confirmed that the lights were no longer powered.  Troubleshooting ensued while the aircraft remained in the traffic pattern; after determination that all circuit breakers were in their closed positions; it was determined that either an alternator or regulator failure had occurred.  Load shedding ensued to minimize draw on the batteries.  The transponder was briefly set to 7700; and then 7600.  Switching the transponder switch to TEST momentarily resulted in no positive indication of function.  With all electronics and radios then placed in the OFF position; excluding 1 radio; the PTT on the pilot's side was pressed which resulted in the 'T' transmit light on the KX-155 radio illuminating; a radio check with UNICOM was unsuccessful - although reception of other traffic/UNICOM on the radio was successful.  A radio call to 121.5; and Approach was unsuccessful as with the call to UNICOM.  Using CRM the passenger was instructed to contact UNICOM by use of their personal cell phone.  After discussing the situation; airport management was asked to confirm the landing gear was down.  After confirmation that gear was down; landing approach ensued on the next iteration of the traffic pattern.  On the first approach to landing; when abeam the touchdown zone on the downwind leg; when flaps were selected down; the avionics stack again browned out until the flap lever was released.  An uneventful go-around was completed; and an approach to landing with no flaps was completed.  A minimum sink approach was accomplished in the event the landing gear was not locked; and a prolonged rollout was completed to ensure minimal loads on the landing gear.  An idle taxi off the runway to the tie-down spot was completed.  Upon securing the cockpit and disembarking the aircraft; Approach was contacted by telephone to discuss the events.  Troubleshooting and repair of the aircraft's electrical system is on-going.

We assumed prior to departure that there was an overcast layer that we would have to penetrate IFR; so filed IFR prior to departure.  Departed VFR heading southwest and then contacted SoCal approach to open IFR flight plan and requested RNAV GPS 24 approach (Fullerton was using runway 24).  Instead; we get:  'direct Paradise; depart on radial 270; intercept V394; V394 to Seal Beach'.  We then again requested radar vectors to the RNAV GPS 24 approach (the IAF was conveniently right in front of us) but were again given the original clearance.  Fortunately; we could see that the feared overcast layer was only very limited coverage; so we canceled IFR and dropped straight into Fullerton VFR.  In fairness; I should point out that Fullerton ATIS said they were using the VOR-A approach; and Seal Beach is the IAF for that approach.  Having said that...my comment follows: The approach that SoCal offered (and would not alter) is complicated to execute even if you're all geared up for it; and downright difficult if you want to program it into a modern aircraft.  Instead of loading an existing approach or STAR; it's a manual entry of at least three VORs and radials and a Victor airway (and by the way; Victor airways are very [seldom] in use in the rest of the US).  Incidentally; you have to know the 3-letter identifiers of the VORs; or look them up; and you have to know that V394 makes a dogleg turn at AHEIM (which incidentally makes it difficult to find and trace V394 on the map).  The clearance doesn't mention Pomona VOR which you have to figure out is ON the airway in the first place.  So once you've figured this all out; and are either going back to the stone age and tuning the VORs and radials; or have gone through probably a hundred keystrokes to program it into the Garmin; you *still* have to intercept a Victor airway *between* waypoints (and this must be for the convenience of SoCal; because it certainly is not convenient for the pilot) and then manually sequence to the V394 route segment.  All this is necessary because SoCal wants you to use the VOR-A approach; another outdated procedure; which is nuts because you have to first OVERFLY the destination; then turn back to it; execute the unaligned procedure WITH A TAILWIND and CIRCLE TO LAND rather than just load and execute the GPS approach that's aligned with the active runway.All this while flying the airplane and accepting a constant stream of frequency and altitude changes.The odds of successful execution of this clearance by single-pilot IFR; unless the pilot is very experienced with this area and this procedure; seem quite low.  The odds of screwing it up are excellent.I guess I don't understand SoCal's problems; but they certainly don't understand mine.  Was this a case of poor controlling; or is this SoCal's best offering?  Why shouldn't they plop an airplane right onto the runway-aligned GPS procedure that's right in front of it?  If there's a timing/sequencing issue; why wouldn't they give you a hold at the GPS approach's IAF; and then release as soon as a window opens?  If using a Victor airway is absolutely essential; why wouldn't they at least give you a normal entry point instead of departing some other VOR on a radial and intercepting at mid-segment?  Do they realize that the route they specified requires four course changes just to get to the IAF?",,,,"Columbia 400 pilot reported he received a clearance from SoCal Approach that would have been very challenging to correctly program and fly in his glass cockpit aircraft.",

At the same time a G-IV; located west south-west of the airport; was approaching the field and he requested to use visual for RWY 05; the request was approved. When the twin prop turned on final; tower requested the G-IV to square the base to final approach. When the twin prop was on short final RWY 14; the G-IV was cleared to land RWY 05. On RWY 14; between intersection C3 and C2; the twin prop was suddenly requested to clear the runway. The request was able to be complied with only aggressive usage of brakes; and not without distress due to the closeness of space. The only intersection available before the intersecting runways was C2; the space at that point is confined and less than few hundreds feet.  As the twin prop was aggressively applying brakes to exit RWY 14 the G-IV was on runway 05 decelerating before the two intersecting runways. At the time the Tower gave this unexpected instruction; the twin prop did not have any room left; and any possible evasive action at that point was therefore lost. In case the usage of the full runway length should have been required the result could have been disastrous. The twin prop was cleared to land first and without any restriction. The runway available (14) between touchdown and RWY 05 is less than 2;500 feet.

Air temp roughly 0 degrees C. Approximately 2:20 elapsed flight time to that point.The procedure for fuel management in the Cessna 310 is to run from the main (tip) tanks for approximately 1 hour; then switch to auxiliary wing tanks. After consuming fuel in the auxiliary wing tanks (the 40.5 gal total capacity in the auxiliary tanks in this aircraft is normally consumed after 1-1.25 hour flight time); the fuel selector is returned to the main tanks; which are typically near full; having received the return fuel from the injection system while running on the auxiliary tanks. On some occasions; I elect to run the auxiliary fuel system to complete exhaustion; in order to consume all available fuel and to verify the fuel gauge empty indication. This procedure; while not used on every flight; has never resulted in a problem in an engine immediately resuming operation upon returning fuel supply to the main tanks after the first indication of fuel starvation as the auxiliary tanks are run to exhaustion. In this case; however; the Left Engine failed to resume normally after returning to the main tanks. Attempts over a 2-3 minute period to restart following the checklist procedure failed to result in the engine restarting. Rather than continue in the high-drag configuration with the propeller wind milling; and unclear as to the reason for a failure to restart; I elected to feather and secure the Left Engine; and land. ATC was helpful and responsive in providing nearest airport and runway information; and suggested a turn to [nearest suitable airport]; where a controlled and uneventful single-engine landing was made with no damage to the aircraft and no injuries. When on the ground; I consulted by telephone with my home-field mechanic who suggested a series of steps to determine any discernable cause.  After roughly 1 hour on the ground; with air temps in the 50's F; and with the fuel selector left in the mains position as it was during the last airborne restart attempt; the Left Engine primed and started normally. A high-power run-up and monitoring of fuel flows during a takeoff roll were normal; as was the next flight leg; during which leg the tanks were again switched without a problem. The auxiliary tanks; however; were not run to exhaustion. Note that in no prior case has water or any contamination ever been found in sumping the fuel system; the aircraft is stored in a heated hangar at its home field; and was stored in a heated hangar the night before the flight under discussion.While I cannot be certain that further persistence in attempting a restart may have succeeded; it seemed to me that with continued passage of time the likelihood of restart decreased; and risk to the flight built while the aircraft remained in a high-drag configuration.",,,,"C310 pilot reported the left engine failed due to fuel exhaustion and would not restart when a new tank was selected.

During my base to final turn to 19R; I noticed a helicopter flying east to west just past 19L. The helicopter continued towards 19R and made a turn south like he was landing on 19R. I questioned the Tower asking about the helicopter. Tower said the helicopter was landing on the ramp and would not be a factor. The helicopter came to a hover just off the end of 19R on the center line. I made a hard right turn to avoid the helicopter and was able to go around the helicopter and land without incident. Once landing; I asked for a number to contact the Tower. I called and spoke to the controller; who said their ramp was east of 19R and east of Bravo so they should not have been over the runway.

I was operating both engines on the auxiliary tanks and in preparation for descent and landing went to change the fuel selectors back to the main tanks.  The right engine selector moved freely; however the left selector would not move.  The left aux tank had two gallons remaining as indicated by instruments. The airport was reporting 600 scattered and if I recall correctly the ceiling was coming down and visibility was dropping due to snow.I could see alternate airport directly ahead and controllers informed me weather was 2;200 OVC.  I requested a destination change and descent. I elected to make a power reduction on both engines but pulled to power to idle on the left engine in an attempt to conserve fuel.  I broke out into visual conditions and noticed that Exhaust Gas Temperatures (EGTs) on the left engine had dropped indicating it had run out of fuel. I secured the left engine; increased power on the right engine to full.  I located the alternate airport and selected a runway I was aligned with and it was also the longest available.  ATC had reported that the braking action was reported as poor.I landed and applied brakes to stop when the plane began sliding on the ice.  The brakes were locked when a dry patch of concrete was encountered.  This caused the right side main tire to flat spot and wear to the point of failure.  An attempt was made to taxi the plane but was found impossible with a single engine operating and with a flat tire.  We were able to move the plane onto runway a cross runway.  We notified airport management that we would require a tug and to NOTAM the occupied runway closed.

I called Gray approach and asked if they had target at my 12 o'clock. Took a little [time] to respond. My wife and I were both looking for the target. It got within 200 ft of our altitude and was pretty much head on. I was debating turning but I wanted to get a visual if I could to make a better decision. I was going 200 mph or so and the target was going like 240 knots according to my iPad so not much time to figure it out. I had my 530w traffic page set at 6 miles for this exact reason to catch them sooner. We got a visual on the target probably 1.5 miles out. They went under our right wing. We were south bound they were north bound. When they passed ADS-B was alerting 300 ft separation but it had gotten to 200 ft.I complained to Gray approach told them that was way closer than I liked. I am on an IFR flight plan for a reason; to get some more eyeballs looking out for me. The controller kinda blew it off and almost immediately handed me off to Houston Center.

We departed the next morning. I had looked at my Pireps and I saw two Pireps; one area that showed negative or trace ice. I don't remember exactly if it was one or the other. We descended from 7000 ft. which was clear to 4000 ft. and started picking up ice. I received a call at from approach which said an MD80 was picking up light rime at 3000 and the temperature was -3C. I acknowledged and said I was picking up ice at 4000 ft.; the ice was not light; it was moderate. When the accumulations were about 3/4 inch; I activated the boots. I looked out my left side and saw that the ice had come off and continued on with my duties. A little while later; my wife; who is a pilot asked if I was going to blow the boots as I said. I said I did already and she said no ice came off my wing. I looked over to see now a much bigger build-up of ice on the wing. My first thought was that we had lost a vacuum pump as I had double vacuum pump failure once before 17 years ago activating the boots. I immediately took the plane off auto pilot because of the potential of vacuum failure. There was no indication of vacuum failure on the vacuum gauge so I went back to thinking it might be a short in the boot switch.While I was hand flying the plane; I am moving the boots switch back and forth to see if I can get some movement or some clue on the right boot. I then started to wonder about the tail but then decided that was minor compared to asymmetrical ice weight and aerodynamics. The more I played with the switch; the worse the differential got as the left wing kept clearing the ice. I am guessing that at this time there was probably an inch plus of ice on left wing. The ice seemed to be coming at a faster rate as we progressed on the approach. I noticed my airspeed was lower than what it should have been given my power settings. I looked out and saw ice partially covering my Pitot tube. I looked down at the Pitot heat switch and noticed it was turned off. I must have bumped it off playing with the boot switch next to it. I told my wife that we were going to fly off of GPS and subtract 10 knots for the wind which was reported at 340 at 8. I told her I just wanted to keep the speed at about 130 which is much faster than I normally fly the approach; but I knew if there was a problem it would come at a slower speed. I had flown that approach hundreds of times and it is over an area that I grew up in so I knew there was no towers or obstacles that were higher than the 700-1000 ft variable ceiling that ATIS broadcast. My focus then was just to get out of the ice as quickly as possible. We got lucky at about 2000 feet when we broke out of the clouds into a long; almost like a tunnel of clear air. I had decided to stay in the tunnel as long as possible while approaching the airport. We were drifting left of course but I was clear of clouds and I stayed in that attitude until I looked over until I could clearly see the airport. The tower asked me if I was ok as I was left of course. I gave them a one word response of 'correcting' as my issues were not getting to the airport but what I would do once I got to the airport. I had decided to do the approach to landing at 120 knots or so with no flaps until I got down to ground effect; kill the power and hope for the best. The heavy wing was upwind of the crosswind so I thought that would be a plus. What surprised me; is after all the analysis that I did for the last four minutes or so went out the window when I made a snap decision to add 10 degrees of flaps at 1/2 mile out. At this time; I still don't know if that was a plus; a minus; or irrelevant. I do know that I routinely practice crosswinds with 10 degrees of flaps but never with zero degrees so I think I just naturally gravitated to my comfort zone. Within an hour of landing; I called my mechanic; described the situationand asked him to look at the airplane and when he tears it apart that I would like to be there so I could physically see the systems and air routing in case this happens again. I've had to use the boots only three times in 20 years of ownership of that plane and twice I went backwards in safety.",,,,"While flying in a Cessna Skymaster T337 in icing conditions the right wing de-icing boot failed to de-ice the wing.",

Since I was in IMC and night conditions I was tuning the radar to plan any action necessary to deviate from the planned routing due to a cold front crossing ahead. I noticed that the altitude had descended from cruise. The autopilot altitude hold light was still illuminated but not correcting. I disengaged the autopilot and had to fight a full down trim situation. The electric trim did not work and the manual trim reverted quickly to a continuous nose down trim electric input. The aircraft was promptly returned to the assigned altitude and reported to ATC. While holding against the full nose down trim I located and pulled the electric trim circuit breaker which then allowed for manual trim to stabilize. ATC said they were wondering why we were down there and did not indicate if there was any traffic conflict. The remaining hour and twenty minutes of the flight was hand flown and conducted without the autopilot. Since it was at night and in the turbulent weather it was full of tasks that I was glad to have already prepared for. The runaway electric trim down input exceeded the ability and limit of the autopilot altitude hold feature to maintain altitude. This aircraft does not have any trim movement tones or altitude select or altitude alert features. The autopilot stayed engaged and did not give a disconnect tone but tried to maintain altitude and couldn't since it reached its limit. When tasks other than basic flight are added to the operation a constant recheck of the basics should be checked and rechecked. Working with the radar and comparing to the NexRad displays consumed time that added to this altitude loss not being seen earlier. Helpful hints would to be very familiar with your circuit breaker panels especially in the dark. Hand fly practice while communicating and navigating for cruise to approach situations. Whenever there is a lull in cruise activity have approach charts and navigation systems at the ready and preset as much as possible well ahead of time.",,,,"C-310 pilot reported an altitude excursion when the autopilot electric trim ran away in the nose down direction.",

Runways 34 in use. I waited 15 minutes for a flight following clearance; then about a 5 minute wait in line for takeoff. When I was given a takeoff clearance they voided the entire flight following clearance; and I was issued left traffic. Once in left downwind I was told to proceed to the 'Encino Reservoir' and then 'Griffith Observatory' visually and switch to TRACON frequency. Tower also directed me to a SCT frequency which I may have flipped with the original issued. TRACON said I had the wrong frequency though I'm not sure it wasn't the one the Tower gave me in the air. As well; TRACON said I was in BUR Class C airspace. I have 3 WAAS moving maps in the plane and I was outside. In any event TRACON was not happy. I was not happy. There was just no happiness that afternoon.The eastbound route out of VNY to the south side is psychotic. Unless you have rockets attached to your aircraft you cannot climb above the Class C surrounding Burbank.  VNY Tower restricted me to 2500 feet MSL so there's truly a zero chance of climbing over the BUR Class C. That leaves a very narrow corridor in which to navigate between the Burbank Class C and the Los Angeles Class B until you get on frequency with TRACON. When you get a beautiful weekend VFR day; you just can't break into the TRACON communications in a reasonable time.Tell VNY Tower it's really not nice to void a clearance when an aircraft is rolling for takeoff on the active. I know very well that VNY is an incredibly busy tower. But on this day there were numerous opportunities to depart VFR aircraft just sitting at the side of the runway. My home airport seems to be able to get aircraft out much more efficiently. Usually with a 'line up and wait' directive from the tower.

The ammeter in the older C-310 does not give really accurate info other than flow trends. A voltmeter would be preferred. More frequent inflight checks of electrical system advised; especially IFR.

A handheld transceiver would have been nice; but I might not have had time to use it potentially violating the aviate-navigate-communicate priorities.

We had been flying about an hour. I had flown with the pilot several times in years past. The lesson was limited to landings as we had recently done air work. His progress had seemed to erode during the whole flight. After his sixth landing he performed a go around on the 7th. I had told him numerous times to follow his visual cues including VASI lights two white two red to be on proper glide path. During the whole flight he did not seem to be responding to my suggestions and commands. He remarked 'I guess I need to schedule more flight lessons.' On the eighth landing attempt and on final I told him ever more sternly three times that he was low (4 red lights). And finally that he was too slow as well. I attempted to hit the throttle but his hand was firmly on it. We landed short of the runway. When the wheels hit the runway; both tires and wheel pants and one fairing were destroyed. This was a hard lesson for me as until recently I had performed instruction for over 3000 hours with no accidents or incidents. I myself and one other club member are the main instructors for our flying club. In the aftermath the other instructor told me he had no intentions of flying with this particular pilot. He had a history of two previous prop strikes in our club. I realize I had a flawed belief that I could fix anyone and that all members who qualified should be able to enjoy flying this plane our club flagship. I do not make these statements in order to mitigate my complicity in this accident. But my lesson is that a major responsibility of a flight instructor is to inform someone when he is simply not able to safely conduct the performance required of a pilot in command. I myself am going to strive to be a better instructor and avoid this kind of occurrence in the future.",,"Doing training for checkout in new airplane; had been doing landings with flight instructor.

At this point we divided duties and as the switches were in my position I tried to troubleshoot the fault and the CFI flew the airplane. Shutting down the left and right generators separately and together and reset the battery master switch in different combinations to eliminate the charge did not stop the charge and all electrical power was soon lost.We lowered the gear and visually confirmed they were down but could not confirm they were locked with no electrical power.  Since there was the possibility of other issues we decided to divert to ZZZ as they have a longer runway. We called via cell our home airport manager requesting they call ZZZ Tower and advise we were inbound with no radio and to provide our cell number. ZZZ tower called us and advised to continue for a low pass to confirm the gear was down and return to land. Tower confirmed the gear was down; gave us a green light and we landed on Runway XX and off at the taxiway to parking.Contacted the Mechanic who determined it was a failed left starter solenoid/left starter. It's with an abundance of caution I make this report as I do not feel we were in a serious situation or incident and believe we managed the systems problem successfully while communicating with ZZZ Tower.Recommendation: I've noticed other C-310s having similar solenoid problems resulting in electrical power loss due either to the starter solenoid or starter switch. This might be worth determining whether this is systemic and advise other operators.","The reporter stated they were in flight for about 30 minutes when they noticed an unusual charge rate of 28 amps (normal is about 14 amps). Attempting to isolate systems failed and they were unable to resolve the issue. They lost all avionics; flap control; and had to manually lower the landing gear. After landing; reporter had a Mechanic checkout the aircraft's electrical system and he found the starter solenoid contacts were 'welded' together; thus shorting out the battery. The reporter stated experiencing a similar incident in another Cessna 310 where a starter switch caused a similar problem.",,,"C310 pilot reported the electrical system had an unusual charge rate.

I contacted SLC Center and communicated I was going to climb to 17500 feet as I was approaching clouds ahead. As I was climbing up over the clouds my climb was accelerating upward due to convective activity and I was contacted by SLC who saw that I had climbed above 17500 and in fact had exceeded 18000 and was therefore in Class A airspace. I saw that it looked like I could descend back lower heading to the west but I decided I should request an IFR clearance to be able to fly in Class A airspace and climb higher. Before I could call I was contacted by SLC and told that I was to contact the military frequency for Jarbidge and was given a clearance direct to Mountain Home. I turned to the left toward Mountain home and contacted the military facility. I believe the frequency was 118.05. I contacted the military facility and was told that I needed to descend to a lower altitude. I told the controller that it looked like I would be able to descend up ahead. I failed to tell the controller about the convective activity I was experiencing and that I was above the clouds. However due to the aggressive convective activity of the storm building beneath me; I then asked the controller for an IFR clearance to BZN and was told that this was not possible within the military airspace that I was now in. I was called back by the military controller and told to contact SLC Center again and they were going to work something out for me. I contacted SLC Center again and I was given an IFR clearance to 21000 to BZN with vectors. I was given a heading of 070 which I could see was to fly me to the east out of the MOA. However I replied that I was unable to turn to the east due to a large buildup/ thunderstorm to the east on my right side. I continued to turn east as much I was able to and soon got on a heading of 070. In the process; the convective activity pushed me up beyond 21000 and I was contacted to get back down to my assigned altitude. In the middle of dealing with maneuvering around the thunderstorm to the east during the climb and the convective activity my engines were overheating due to the decreased cooling effect of the thinner air. At the same time all of this was going on I was managing changes to cowl flaps; mixture; power settings and airspeed to get the engine CHT temperatures under control. In the middle of this the convective activity was now pushing me down lower and I requested to descend to 19000. The convective activity carried me down below 19000 and I was again contacted and had to climb back up to the assigned altitude of 19000. I could see that I was staying south of restricted area R3204A and B as I exited the MOA.I realized that I should have executed a 180 degree turn when I was pushed above 17500 feet to get out of the convective area that I had flown into. Then I could have requested an IFR clearance up to a higher altitude prior to beginning my flight. I had in fact filed an IFR flight along the route I was flying and should have activated that flight plan when I took off so that I could have easily requested a change in altitude when I encountered the bad weather south of TWF. I am very thankful for the assistance of the controllers that helped me manage this difficult weather situation that I flew into. I plan to get more training to learn how to handle higher altitude VFR to IFR transitions. My experience with IFR flight at high altitudes has been new learning to fly the pressurized Skymaster. I also realize now that military controllers are not trained to handle IFR traffic for separation since their job is to manage military aircraft that are trying to intercept one another.",,,,"Cessna Skymaster pilot reported inadvertently climbing VFR into Class A airspace due to convective activity.

I had planned to leave some 3 hours before I did. Flight planning looked free and clear when I departed. The climb went smooth and I contacted ATC for flight following. At 17500 the ride was bumpy and I was over high terrain. I called ATC and asked if I could get higher. On Oxygen and with a Pulse Oximeter I thought I never had this plane to ceiling and this would be my last flight in her. I asked for 25000. Cleared to climb I found a nice smooth and fast ride. I started studying my arrival and a controller suddenly ordered me to drop to 17000; this was right in the middle of the clouds I was flying above. He was rather aggressive in that order so I complied. When the radio reception started breaking up I called for permission to deviate as the clouds and icing conditions worsened. Before long I was faced with deciding to ignore what ATC requested of me or accept that ice was forming. This is not what I was expecting on a simple VFR flight. I announced this to ATC and got another controller that gave me permission to maneuver as needed and cleared me below the cloud layer. The ice melted; wings cleared and I tried to regain composure after such an event. The new controller asked me if I had the weather for ZZZ and I did have the METAR off the G1000. At some point; I must have flopped channels on the radio and not realized it. When I made repeated calls to ATC I realized I was on the wrong Frequency. I flopped over and the controller stated that they were trying to contact me. He gave me the number to call him. I called him and he explained that I descended without permission; we talked about what all had happened and I apologized for my mistakes. Looking back; I see that I inadvertently put myself in to and IFR situation this instant I asked for higher altitude. Being vectored into an instrument condition was defiantly not expected and while the authoritative voice of the controller intimidated me and Hypoxia could have cluttered my judgment decisions that is not an excuse. I was not comfortable with this chain of events. The responsibility to maintain flight in a safe way is mine; and I have learned greatly from this event. My years of clear weather flying did not due me justice when flying in clouded mountainous areas. Additional training is exactly what I need and I will get.

I had no indications of issues in the prior to the flight. I was able to resolve the issue by recycling the avionics power and re-establishing communication with ground control. Since I had no prior indications that the equipment was having issues I considered one-time event. I contacted ground control for VFR clearance. I was given the VFR clearance and squawk code. No radio issues were present prior to or during taxi. I contacted tower and was given clearance to take off. The ceilings and visibility were unrestricted at time of departure. On the initial climb out I noticed that the Garmin GTN's were indicating TX (transmit) and the PTT switch was not depressed. I tried to recycle the avionics but the problem still persisted. I squawked 7600 on my transponder to let ATC know I was aware of the problem. Since the nav/coms were still indicating they were transmitting; I figured the microphone was still hot; I stated my intentions were to fly straight out; level off at 1000; exit the charlie airspace; and remain clear of all airspace's since I was operating under VFR. I flew out to the east over the water still squawking 7600. Once clear of ZZZ charlie airspace; I was able to briefly re-establish communication with departure at which they told me to squawk VFR/1200 and radar services were terminated. I elected to pull the circuit breakers on both my nav/com's with hopes that I would not be effecting any of the other frequencies. I navigated via my Garmin Aera 796 portable which had current VFR charts on it to ensure I did not violate any airspace. I elected to change my destination to ZZZ2 from ZZZ1 since ZZZ2 was an uncontrolled field and two way communication was not required to land there. The rest of the flight to ZZZ2 was uneventful. I retrieved my airplane from ZZZ2 later that evening and flew it back to ZZZ1 when the tower had closed for the evening. The plane is currently at the avionics shop and will not fly until the issue is resolved. I am unsure what caused the equipment failure; and I am still waiting for the avionics shop to provide me with diagnosis.A few important lessons learned-Always make sure I always have a backup/handheld radio in my flight bag.-Do not assume anomalies with equipment are a one-time incident; plan accordingly.",,,,"A Cessna C310 pilot reported that he experienced an intermittent stuck microphone.",

I asked the pilot if he could make ZZZ or if he would like an airport closer. At this point; he was not [requesting priority handling]; but wanted a closer airport if the weather permitted. My Supervisor gathered weather form local airports closer to the aircraft and we decided on DLZ. He put the RNAV approach in his GPS and flew the approach course. Outside of the Final Approach Fix he asked what the minimums were for the approach and I gave them to him. He then asked if I could step him down because his IPAD's battery had gone out and he didn't have a backup. I asked if he could make it to an airport which was roughly 15 miles west of his current position because there was better VFR weather being reported there. He said he was unable and [requested priority handling]. He also had reported that he could see some breaks in the clouds below him so I descended the aircraft to 2;000 feet and pointed out the airport. The MVA (Minimum Vectoring Altitude) in the area is 2;500 feet. There is an antennae southeast of the airport that is 900 feet and wanted to wait until he was over the airport to issue a further descent in case he veered from the final approach course. He reported the field in sight about a 2 mile final and proceeded visually.If I had to do it over; I would have asked for more information earlier to make sure of the equipment he had on board.

ZZZ1 recently had its IFR approach NOTAMed not available; and a replacement has not been put in with higher minimums or something; so I intended to fly to ZZZ; do an approach into VMC; and cancel and divert to ZZZ1; or cancel before an approach in VMC.Reaching the area; I hit some excellent VMC and cancelled IFR after checking the ceilings/visibility at nearby airports (with ADS-B and XM weather). The airports all showed good VMC with ceilings in the 1;900 to 2;900 foot range and above.I descended to stay below the Class B but nearing the area west of ZZZ the ceilings were lower than reported for any in the area. I slowed; descended to keep in VMC; turned on my radar altimeter; checked terrain warning systems; and proceeded. Eventually I reached 1;000 AGL or so in the 1;200-1;600 feet MSL range and was unable to maintain VMC; which happened gradually due to indistinct bases. Not wanting to descend much below 1;000 AGL (due to many towers in the area and also some areas around there being congested) and with the heavy workload to maintain attitude and altitude I was unable to decide whether to contact a local controller and request an immediate IFR clearance; and/or to proceed or reverse course. The periodic terrain warnings were also annoying and I had no workload-permitting way to silence them since I was hand flying and trying to maintain periods of VMC or at least ground contact.In the end; the ceilings lifted and my unintentional flight into IMC (bottoms of clouds) ended and I made an uneventful landing.Chain of events/Human performance considerations:1. Cancelled IFR believing that reasonably solid VMC prevailed in the area due to all nearby airports reporting at least 1;900 foot ceilings and 9 miles visibility - which was not the case for the entire area. Should probably have kept IFR until Approach had descended me to 2;000-ish which would have put me in clear VMC.2. Unreasonable belief that the weather couldn't 'really be this bad' given all the weather reports (and the ASOS/AWOS); some sort of misguided faith that the weather would be better in just a moment. By the time I realized the true situation my workload had increased to the point where I was unable to look up an appropriate ATC frequency to request immediate IFR clearance. For whatever reason; a 180 turn out of the weather did not occur to me despite the repeated training for VMC into IFR to do just that - I think it was an unreasonable belief in the reported METARs probably.All in all; not remotely my finest judgement or my finest day; despite maintaining positive control of the aircraft at all times (although looking at the track logs does not make it seem that way; since I was constantly varying altitude and occasionally power).Note that the hour estimates above are just estimates; I didn't pull exact numbers from my logbooks.",,,,"C310 pilot reported flying VFR into IMC.",

I was flying VFR under a flight plan and preparing for arrival to ZZZ1. I received ATIS information Gulf; which advised to use XXX.X to contact the Tower; and that the XXX.Y frequency was inoperative. I contacted ZZZ1 Tower over [waypoint]; confirmed [ATIS] information Gulf and Controller instructions to fly over [the] dam and extend base to [Runway] XXL. About this time; I activated landing lights. Subsequently; I heard the Tower instruction that I may shorten my pattern as another aircraft had exited and was cleared for landing. I acknowledged (however I subsequently learned that the Tower was not receiving my transmissions). During this time; I set the landing gear down and was preparing for the pattern turn. On approximately 2 mile final; I had a perception that the instrument lights were dimming; but still operating. I was completing a pre-landing GUMP and was unable to identify my landing gear completion cycle 'green light' indicator. I quickly looked out the window to confirm main gear extension; but unable to see the nose gear.  The flaps extension did not activate; and upon consideration; I elected to perform a go-around. I transmitted to the Tower advising that 'I had not received gear down confirmation and was performing a go-around to recycle the gear' but did not receive a reply (as mentioned above; Tower was not receiving my transmissions and I was unaware of this at the time). About this same time; all instrument panel lights and radios went dark; gauges dropped to null readings; and I could see the landing lights were not functioning. It was clear during the power-up stage of the go-around that I had suffered a complete electrical failure. I activated a flashlight in the cabin; established a left pattern return to [Runway] XXL; performed a series of procedures to investigate for fire; shorts; alternator and circuit breaker problems and de-load the system; while deliberating over the landing gear issue. During this time I looked for and saw a green light from the Tower and focused attention on completing the landing of the aircraft. The gear lock indicator was in place and I felt the gear light may be related to the rest of the electrical; so I proceeded with the landing procedure while still attempting to recover electric power. After searching the landing patterns and extending due to seeing one set of position lights from another aircraft in the vicinity; I re-established final approach when clear. During final; I saw green lights flashing from the Tower area and proceeded; I then noticed red flashing lights in the vicinity of the Tower and prepared for another go-around until I was able to determine that these were emanating from emergency vehicles. Flaps were still inoperative; and I performed a normal landing. Upon exiting the runway I was assisted by an emergency vehicle that helped illuminate the pathway out of the movement area and back to parking. Although it appeared one of the radios was attempting to fire back up just as I was shutting down the aircraft; I have not yet determined what precisely happened with the electrical system. Subsequent to shut-down; I spoke with the Fire Crew who assisted us and contacted the Tower Controller to explain what occurred. I believe all personnel acted in a very professional manner that was appropriate for the situation and was sure glad they were there in this event. Upon consideration and review of the incident with my mechanic; and considering the 'Chain of Events' and 'Human Performance Considerations;' I believe that a more aggressive observation of the electrical signals may have been helpful in either heading off this result; or at least communicating it before the radios went dead. As mentioned above; I did notice a dimming of the lights. The Skymaster is 1966 vintage and uses post lights on the panel which are relatively dim compared to newer systems. Thus; a certain 'I'm used to this' attitudemay need to be adjusted; because they seemed to be unusually dimming at the end of the flight. Had this occurred midway through the flight; I may have had more time to troubleshoot; but it was lighter ambient conditions; and that may have masked the situation further (my newer radios automatically darken as the skies darken). I believe that the battery of the aircraft may have become discharged to a point that the electrical system was overwhelmed. But I also feel this must have been compounded by the failure of the alternator(s) to pick up the difference. I still have some questions on that. The low voltage light never illuminated and I always check circuit breakers before starting engines and during the run-up. I usually check circuit breakers between decent and arrival procedure as well and on this particular flight; I checked them again during the go-around. I did not notice any abnormality; but at shut-down the rear alternator was popped. The airplane has a front alternator; we're still not sure why that didn't seem to pick up the difference; but I am told that it is possible the battery may not have had enough charge to excite the field coil to energize the alternator. This also perplexes me as the engines started on battery power. However; I did have prior legs on the day's flight and this required an abnormally long hot start at a high altitude location which I am much more interested in now than at the time. Could the battery have somehow drained below the needed level but still cranked the engine?  Since the flight; we pulled the battery and it indicated dead on testing. The mechanic recharged it; load tested it; and re-certified it for operation. Connections were double checked and cleaned and I have since tested all electrical items; verified both over volt and undervolt warning lights; gear lights; battery and charging indicators; and subjected the electrical system to a full load of use and unable to recreate the situation (starting with a known full charge battery; of course). So this is still a bit of a mystery; but I am moving battery condition to a higher priority than I previously did.  The last item that I think was sort of unexpected but may deserve some attention is the location and status of emergency vehicles in the vicinity of the tower at night. During the final approach after going around; the flashing red lights in the proximity of the Tower; with my completely dark cockpit and the somewhat distracting flashlight use; resulted in my momentary belief that the green light signal had changed and that I was to go around again. My cowl flaps are electric; and [the city] was over 105 degrees Fahrenheit that evening and the thought of another go around with dead electric (and possible complications or reason why) and possible heating up engines (it's amazing what goes through the mind during these moments) caused me a bit of dread until I determined it was fire trucks. I'm actually very happy with the response of the emergency procedures and can't rave enough how glad I was they were there; but it may be helpful; at night conditions; to use yellow or blue lights instead of red ones on emergency vehicles near the Tower - in the event the airplane has no radio. As I read this; that may be too limited an event; but it was a [momentary] link in the chain.",,,,"C337 pilot reported electrical power failure resulting in a precautionary landing at night.",

We had flown the aircraft two days prior and had just returned from a flight of about 1.6 hours. We were taxiing back to the runway from the taxi way connector when the aircraft began to pick up speed. I instructed the student to begin to slow the aircraft down which she agreed with and began to do so. While slowing the aircraft it began to veer to the right slightly. I instructed the student to gently apply some left rudder to straighten the airplane. The left input was initially given and I believe the student thought that she had given too much as she made a hard input to the right. The input was harsh enough that as I tried to block the large input with my foot it raised me up against my seatbelt. When a large input is made in this aircraft over 20 degrees the wheel begins to do what is known as free cast. All that can really be done at that point is stop the aircraft and straighten the wheel. The rudder can no longer move the nose wheel in the opposite direction. I sensed this happened and immediately pulled back the throttles and mixture to stop thrust and applied full brakes. The aircraft almost got stopped but as the nose of the aircraft fell over the edge of the hill next to the taxi way; the momentum pulled us over the edge. At this point I continued to stand on the brakes to attempt to stop the aircraft but the downward momentum was too great. The aircraft came to rest against a chain link fence and some small brush. I secured the aircraft by shutting off battery power and fuel selectors and helped the student safely exit the plane. I carry insurance but found out after the fact that the owner did not have an insurance policy.","Reporter stated that the student had almost no multi-engine time and that student had a tendency to over control while taxiing. Reporter also stated that the likely cause of the aircraft initially veering to the right was a slightly advanced left throttle and uneven braking.",,,"CE310 Instructor reported exiting the taxiway and proceeding down an embankment after the student applied improper rudder steering input.",

The aircraft is also equipped with a Garmin GTX345 transponder meeting all ADS-B requirements. The plan was to make a series of maneuvers including 90 degree turns north and west of the departing airport outside of Class B airspace and west of the local military airfield. All maneuvers were to occur from 6500-7500 ft. MSL east of restricted airspace located further to our west. We departed ZZZ outside the Class B airspace and proceeded to the preplanned maneuvering area. The only radio communication was over the traffic advisory frequency. The transponder was operating correctly squawking 1200 in altitude reporting mode. Weather conditions were CAVU (Ceilings and Visibility Unlimited) with light southerly winds increasing demonstrably. After maneuvering around for some 30-40 minutes; focusing on the primary flight display for the maneuvering; we turned south to try navigational tracking. After several minutes; I realized the multifunction display was still showing an old relative position and was not moving. The GNS430W had a TCAS overlay covering the display map. As I was unable to unfreeze the MFD screen; I tried visually to get our bearings. I realized we were no longer over the lake and we were significantly further west than I thought now heading south. Once clearing the TCAS overlay on the GNS430W; I realized the aircraft was in the middle of a restricted area. The southern edge of the zone seemed closest; so we continued south and southeast until exiting the restricted area. During a telephone debriefing that afternoon with Control (the military ATC authority over that airspace); I was informed they were having a live fire exercise underneath us. I explained our situation and thanked them for keeping us safe during our incursion. I agreed to participate in an upcoming Mid Air Collision Avoidance (MACA) Safety Briefing to relate the experience to other pilots attending. There are some steps I should have taken to prevent or otherwise mitigate this situation: Do not become preoccupied with just flying the aircraft. Remember to navigate and always know where you are. Having state of the art equipment doesn't do any good if it's not used properly. Communicate with the appropriate ATC authority. During the debriefing with Control; they informed me that had I contacted them when I was in the original maneuvering area; they would have been able to warn me when they saw I was getting too close to the restricted area. Secondly; I should have immediately contacted Control once I realized where I was. They would have provided vectors for the safest and most efficient exit from the restricted area.",,,,"C310 pilot reported while testing new avionics; pilot entered restricted airspace.",

As I turned final; I had no visual of that traffic. I asked the Tower where the traffic landing in front of me was. Coming down the glideslope; I saw a TCAS target in front and slightly to the left of me on my MFD indicating what looked like a mid-air about to happen. I called the Tower to ask where the aircraft cleared in front of me was and he said he was just turning final; consistent with my thought that a mid-air was imminent. As I still had no visual on that aircraft; I announced to the Tower that I was making a climbing right 360 to avoid the traffic. I made a tight 360 so as not to interfere with traffic in the pattern. As there were perfect VMC conditions; I could see where I was going in the turn. The Tower then said make it a 340 turn; not a 360. When I was at the 340 mark or so; I asked if I was cleared to land; as there was no traffic in front of me. I then received the clearance to land. On landing; Ground Control advised that it was a possible deviation for making the 360. My reason for deviating with a 360 turn was I never had a visual on the traffic in front of me but made my judgment on the basis of the TCAS target. As Pilot in Command; I felt the plane was in imminent danger; that immediate action was required and that failure to do so would put the lives of me and my passenger; plus the lives of the other pilot and passengers in mortal danger; especially with the Tower handling so many other calls. The number of planes in the pattern added to the delay in communications with the Tower. Also; because I was in right traffic and the plane cleared before me was on the left turn to final to the same runway; I never did have a visual on the plane cleared before me. I was not advised the plane I would be following on final would be turning from a left base in front of me; or I would have been looking there for that traffic.

Having just past the PMD VOR northbound and on a heading of 315; I was in the vicinity of WJF when I encountered wake turbulence from an aircraft. There were no traffic alerts or advisories; however 3 military aircraft were seen. One; a C130; was crossing west to east and ~1;000 ft. lower than us. Two others; estimated to be a C5A and a KC135; were turning south and would pass off our left wing approximately 5 miles to the west. I assumed they were descending on approach to Edwards AFB as this is along a straight line from this position.None of these aircraft passed in front of us nor were at the same altitude us.[I] encountered wake turbulence [and] was immediately rolled inverted and to the right approximately 270 degrees of roll. To recover from this upset I continued the roll to a wings level attitude; but the nose was ~ 30 degrees low (below the horizon) and we were on a course of 253. The recovery was normal and the forward airspeed did not exceed 180 kts. Vne for this aircraft is 220 kts. and Va is 182 kts.We contacted Joshua Approach and informed them of our upset; saying we had just done a uncommanded 'barrel roll' and had recovered. There were no injuries to passengers nor damage to the aircraft. After recovery we regained our cruising altitude of 10;500 ft. msl but overshot when I misread the altimeter and reset the autopilot.During the upset we were using an autopilot which did not disengage during the event.We continued our flight and landed at our destination with no further problems. Subsequent checks showed no damage or loss of fuel or fluidsConsidering the number and type of aircraft operating in the vicinity of our flight; I believe we should have been alerted to the traffic and the possibility of wake turbulence in the vicinity.",,,,"C310 pilot reported a loss of aircraft control due to a possible wake turbulence encounter.",

I suggested that on our return; he sit in the left seat and we fly to ZZZ where they had longer runways than our home field and he could practice some landings. While he was rated; I was still PIC from the right seat as he was not multi engine current and I was a multi engine CFI.We flew down and executed an RNAV/GPS (Area Navigation) approach to Runway XX in VMC conditions. I said that our first landing exercise would be to take the plane almost down to the runway and just fly a foot or so off of the deck to help visualize the sight picture; before cutting the throttles and landing. We'd then taxi back for more pattern work.The approach was very successful and everything went well until about 50 feet when he started to flare. I said we needed to keep coming down; we were nowhere near the altitude we needed to be at to begin the flare; but he leveled off; seeming to feel for the runway from that point. We quickly reached the midpoint of the runway and I began thinking that a go around would be necessary but I let him continue a bit further. Shortly thereafter I called for a go around but he cut the power; raised the nose; and landed firmly; about 2/3 of the way down the runway. I did not think we had room to stop on the remaining runway and at 80 knots we were close to flying speed. He told me to take over and I applied full power. At the end of the runway we still were slower than I would want to be but I raised the nose and we were airborne in ground effect. The plane was very slow to accelerate or climb and I felt my friend pulling back on the yoke. I pushed forward not wanting to stall or leave ground effect. At this point I realized that our gear was still down and that we had landing flaps. I knew that if I retracted landing flaps we had a very strong potential to sink into the ground so faced with that option I left the flaps down. I was not sure of the drag effect from gear retraction so I left it down as well. Again I felt him pulling back on the wheel while I yelled 'stop pulling' and pushed forward.Soon there was a row of trees in the windshield and I gathered we had gotten all of the speed we could for the time being and I pulled back on the yoke. The tower controller had seen what was going on and asked us if we were ok; did we need assistance; and did we see the trees. He also asked if we would be avoiding the trees. These calls were a distraction and I did not answer as my first priority was to fly the aircraft.We climbed out; retracting the gear and flaps. The controller asked if we wanted him to cancel IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) and for us to resume our pattern work. Shaken; I was not interested in pattern work and I asked him to cancel IFR and we would leave the area. Since he had questioned if we had hit the trees I decided to fly about 5 miles to an airport where I have maintenance done to have the plane inspected. Apparently we had made contact with the very top of the tree line as evidenced by some leaves on the nose gear. The mechanic came out to inspect the plane and could find no damage at all after inspecting the gear; flaps; wings; fuselage; and general condition.In retrospect; I had put my friend in a bad position. Even though he had watched me land many times; and had landed himself in the past; I should have demonstrated the first landing. I know better than to land outside the touchdown zone and yet we did. At the midpoint of the runway with limited runway ahead of us; I should have had an aggressive transfer of control and taken the plane around myself. If I had done that I have no doubt I would have raised the gear and flaps allowing a successful climb out; but in the uncertain transfer of control with the pilot monitoring suddenly and unexpectedly becoming the pilot flying; the sequence of a successful go around were lost.I can't help but think that I put the pilot flying into a bad position by not doing the go around sooner and not having the plane in proper climb configuration was a bad error. I have replayed this many times and reminded myself that in this situation; even though you are not the flying pilot; you have to stay on top of things mentally and be prepared to take over at any point.The better decision after the touch down would have been to get out of the mental go around mind set and just kept it on the ground. A couple of blown tires and a plane in the overrun would have been nothing compared to the threats of staggering into the air in a bad configuration with trees ahead.",,,,"C310 Flight Instructor reported striking trees during go around.",

Our plan was to depart Runway XX at ZZZ and shoot Instrument Approaches at ZZZ1; ZZZ2; and ZZZ. We would then make a full stop and end the flight at ZZZ. An IFR flight plan was filed with ATC ; and was to be picked up once airborne. During the preflight checklists; we did a complete exterior preflight check before discussing how to appropriately board the aircraft. [Name] boarded the passenger side; and I boarded into the pilot side. We discussed how to properly secure the seatbelt; and then had a very detailed description of how to close and secure the door properly by turning the door handle to the proper closed position; to where it drops into the proper detent. I demonstrated to [Name] with my door handle where the correct position for the door handle was to be in when closed. We taxied out to Runway XX; and proceeded to go through the run up checklist. At the end of the checklist; I specifically pointed out that the annunciator panel had all lights off.During the takeoff climb; approximately 1.5 miles to the NE of ZZZ; we were climbing through 1;500 ft. MSL for 3000 ft. MSL. Everything sounded and felt completely normal inside the aircraft. The winds were calm; and the barometric pressure was 30.46. Our climb rate was 500 ft./min and our IAS was 120 kt. All of the sudden; without any warning; the pilot side door blew off of the aircraft; and completely detached.I leveled off the aircraft; slowed to approach flap speed; while making a left turn back toward ZZZ; and begin to make a landing on Runway XY at ZZZ. I was able to maintain complete control of the aircraft with the pilot side door completely gone. I announced our situation; and that we would be entering a right base to final approach to Runway XY. I deployed approach flaps and landing flaps; entered a right base leg; slowed to 90 KT; and made a right hand turn for a short final approach to Runway XY; and was able to execute a safe landing.After landing safely; I taxied back to hangar ; and we shut down and departed the aircraft. We did a detailed inspection of the aircraft and took several photographs of the pilot side door hinges. We notified the ZZZ airport authority and local police of our situation. Since we had a clear idea of our position when the door detached; we drove to the approximate area in my truck. We found the door in the parking lot of the [Name]. When we located the door; we took several photographs of the door before touching it. The door handle was in the closed position in the proper safety detent.

I cleared him and climbed him to his requested altitude; not thinking about the MIA northeast of CGI being 035 because of the towers. I was concerned more about his speed and losing 5 miles separation with an arrival to CGI from the northwest and getting him to report the field in sight and then he did and cancelled IFR. I was busy tending to other traffic and the MSAW alert never went off. The MSAW normally would go off instantly when the aircraft departed northeast bound because it's a large area that has to be missed. The tower had gone home almost an hour before. They would have asked about it also. When he was roughly 1 or 2 miles east of the tallest tower; a controller at ZKC called me and asked if the aircraft was really at 030. I realized immediately what had happened and I said yes. It was too late to to anything different with the aircraft at that point. He was missing the towers. But after I hung up the landline I realized the MSAW never was flashing telling me he was at an unsafe altitude. I called the other controller back and asked him if his MSAW was going off. He said right after he had called me it started to go off. I fully accept responsibility for making the mistake of not realizing 030 was an unsafe altitude on his route. However; the MSAW should have been going off for several minutes and this is a safety issue. I have been working at this facility for almost 30 years and have never even known it would be possible for me to disable the MSAW and I would never try to do such. The first thing the tech ops guy asked my supervisor was if it was turned on. Like I said; I didn't know it could be turned off on an individual sector any more than you could disable Conflict alert.

The validation flight was required after installation by the STEC 3100 according to the installation directions to validate operation of the system. This aircraft's POH and instruments are calibrated in MPH as the primary reference.During this flight; the aircraft suffered a dual engine loss-of-power due to fuel starvation. Aircraft was recovered normally.Mission planning was completed; including review of flight requirements; weather; NOTAMs; calculation of take-off and landing data; and planned flight profile. The aircraft POH was reviewed and a flight data/line-up card with critical and operational information for this aircraft from the POH was prepared. Pilot used Twin Cessna Type Group Risk Assessment tools (TTCF FRAT); as well as FAA Handbook H-8083-2 Risk Management and ADM tools for mission planning. Pilot did a complete cockpit orientation using the POH.Fuel was checked during planning. The main (tip) tanks were physically checked and appeared to be 2/3 full; which corresponded with the indicated gauge readings of 200# of fuel; the aux (wing) tanks were also physically checked and appeared to be full to the filler necks; corresponding with the approximately indicated 120# of fuel. The aircraft is placarded at 50 gallons in the main (tip) tanks; approximately 300#; and 20 gallons in the aux (wing) tanks; approximately 120#. Total fuel was planned at 640#; with a 150# reserve (60 minutes of fuel at 65% power - 147pph; 2450 RPM; 20' MP at 10;000'; this is a conservative approach based on a higher power rather than 20'; 2300rpm and 133 pph).Mission planning was based on a 65% power profile; with intermittent use of 75% power; a 160pph fuel burn for the entire was used for calculations; in excess of the 147 pph in the POH for 65% power. Effective flight time was planned at 3.0 hours; based on 490# of fuel available at 160 pph.Preflight was ref the POH; all lights and systems were ops checked. 2 qts of Phillips XC 20W50 oil was added to the left engine to bring oil level to 11 qts (12 qts total). No leaks or abnormal issues were noted in the preflight. Fuel gauges appeared to operate normally with previously stated fuel levels.Engine start and ground operations were normal and in accordance with both the POH and owner supplied checklist(s); additionally; the Pilot referenced additional Twin Cessna Type Association recommended checks and pre-takeoff reviews (Go/No-Go criteria; abort criteria and steps; engine failure on Takeoff steps; etc...).Takeoff was normal at approximately XA15 hours local; with aircraft achieving Go/No-Go check speed early (75% of calculated takeoff speed in under 50% of calculated takeoff roll). Engine indications were nominal; and performance was nominal. Aircraft gear retraction and clean-up was normal. A VFR departure was initiated; climb profile was set to 10;500 and engine and aircraft performance was normal within POH parameters.The working area was visually cleared; with ADS-B monitoring confirmed; and monitoring of Departure frequency for situational awareness. Area work was commenced after clearing turns and referencing the STEC checklist. Fuel at commencement of area work was approximately 180# per side; with mains selected. Area work progressed uneventfully; with normal aircraft and engine performance. Area work took longer than planned; requiring approximately 60 minutes to complete.At approximately XB:20 hours local; an IFR pickup was made with Approach to conduct the remaining flight requirements (A VOR approach; an ILS approach; an RNAV approach). Systems checks were normal; fuel indicated approximately 120# per side; as expected based on preflight fuel calculations and the flight parameters used to that point. 20'; 2300rpm and 130pph was set inbound for cruise.Inbound to the VOR; AUX tanks were selected; the AUX Tank indicator lights illuminated as expected; and the fuel indicators reflected AUX fuel loads of approximately 120#. Pilot used the tank gauge select switch to check MAIN fuel levels; which were also at 120#. Weather was checked using ATIS; showing approached to RWY XX. Pilot executed a check for arrival; and a check to review the approach. Missed approach instructions back to Radar were obtained.The VOR RWY XX approach was flown inbound. Approaching the Final Approach Fix (FAF); Pilot selected MAIN tanks; the AUX tank lights went out as expected; and Mains showed approximately 150# of fuel as expected (excess fuel from the engines cycles into the MAIN tanks from the AUX tanks). Aircraft was configured normally with Gear; 15' flaps; and lights. Pilot conducted a GUMPS check confirming Gas (Mains and adequate fuel); Undercarriage (Three green); Mixture (full rich - Pilot also confirmed EGTs and CHTs in lower range); Prop (prop full forward and matched without prop synch); and Speeds (120 kts on final approach).Approach and subsequent missed approach were normal. Aircraft cleaned up and accelerated normally in all respects. At level off; Pilot selected AUX tanks to continue fuel management and transfer usable fuel to Mains. AUX tanks indicated approximately 115# each side; and AUX tank lights illuminated normally. Mains checked at approximately 130# each side. 22'; 2400rpm and full rich was set. Vectors to an ILS RWY X (opposite direction) were requested and approved; [arrival] and [approach] checks were accomplished as before. During vectors; assigned 7500 until established on the ILS; RPM was reduced to 2100-2150 to reduce speed for approach. On the final vector to final; RPM was increased to 2400 to check and maintain airspeed.On final; outside of the final approach fix; and prior to configuration; with the localizer course aligned; and prior to glideslope intercept (GS live but not descending) the aircraft was being slowed to configuration speed; airspeed was approximately 140 mph (Flap limiting airspeed for 15 flaps is 180; for gear and full flaps 160). Aux tanks were still selected; normal technique is to select mains prior to configuring as on VOR 21. Aircraft was on Autopilot to validate STEC 3100 operation on an ILS.Fuel indications at this time on AUX tanks was 50# right (approximately 10 gallons) and 80# left (approximately 13 gallons). Engines were set at approximately 22' of MP; with RPM approximately 2400; and mixture was still rich from the last approach; and radar pattern operations.At this point; pilot sensed yaw to the left developing. Pilot cross-checked engine instruments and saw left RPM had decreased to 1700 rpm; and left fuel flow was decreasing; Oil temp; oil pressure; and CHT's were all in normal range. Pilot cross checked airspeed and found it decaying but above blue line of 116mph; due to the loss-of-power on the left engine. Pilot notified the passenger (the Avionics Repairman);' We're losing a motor'.The aircraft at this time started to rapidly enter a left wing low; nose low; left yaw attitude.Pilot toggled off the autopilot and yaw dampener; and initiated the single engine loss recovery procedure by simultaneously raising the left wing to a minimum 5' bank to the RIGHT; applying ½ ball rudder trim with rudder pedals; and selecting full power; full prop; and mixture full rich (3-full-forward).The aircraft achieved level flight; and descent was checked; airspeed had decayed from 140 mph to approximately 120 mph; with an altitude loss of approximately 100'; and a heading change of 20' to the left of ILS course.At this point; the right engine suffered a loss of power; with RPM decreasing. The aircraft yawed heavily to the right; with a corresponding rapid right wing drop and rapid nose drop; due to the power loss on the right engine with left engine loss controls input.Pilot checked power-pitch-mixture full forward and leveled the wings. Pilot verbalized 'Pitch to 120' to obtain an airspeed above blue line. At this point; Pilot made a rapid radio call. 'Tower; TA we lost both motors'. Pilot initiated this radio call to notify Approach of the situation; and to initiate an increased level of monitoring; due to the low altitude and surrounding terrain. The call to 'Tower' was in error.Pilot then pitched to maintain flying airspeed above 'blue line'; airspeed had decreased to approximately 110 knots. Pilot regained airspeed of 120 mph; with a loss of 100 additional feet. Pilot simultaneously initiate main.During this time; Approach made a radio inquiry; Pilot requested that they 'Stand-By'Upon selecting the right tank to main; the right engine recovered full power and momentarily drove the aircraft towards a left roll; left yaw; nose down attitude. Pilot initiated a left wing up attitude to counter the forces while simultaneously selecting left tank to main. The right engine recovered full power and the Pilot recovered the aircraft to level; full power flight.Pilot then recovered to 140 MPH; recovered to being on localizer course (from ½ dot right); and to FAF/GS intercept altitude. Pilot did this to ensure operations within protected airspace; and to fully utilize course and GS information for safety.Total altitude loss was approximately 300' during this incident; with airspeed decaying during the loss of the RIGHT engine to approximately 109 mph; below VYse but above best Single Engine ANGLE of climb (108); recommended single engine speed (105) and minimum single engine control speed (86).Total duration of the incident was less than 30 seconds; from first indication until full two-engine recovery.Pilot then notified approach that power had been restored and that the aircraft would continue the approach. Approach switched aircraft to Tower. Pilot initiated a normal configuration for the approach; and flew the ILS - opposite direction to the localizer MDA.Tower asked if Pilot 'required services'; Pilot stated no; power was restored. Tower asked if Pilot would be making the approach a full-stop. Pilot declined; due to the approach being an opposite direction approach; and there being a tailwind. Pilot chose not to accomplish a circling approach due to the lack of daylight; and not having briefed the circling approach.Pilot executed the assigned missed approach back to radar and requested the RNAV RWY XX with a turn in holding. Pilot requested this to allow for a cockpit and systems check in controlled airspace; without rushing; to ensure that all systems were in order.Pilot and Passenger reviewed appropriate checklists and used the time on vectors to ZZZZ1 to run checklists and make initial assessments. Pilot made an initial assessment that the cause of the power loss was likely fuel starvation from the AUX tanks; despite the AUX tanks showing 75# left and 60# right. main tanks at this time showed approximately 150# each side.Pilot ran fuel calculations and determined that sufficient fuel remained in main tanks to permit a normal approach and landing. Pilot checked all CBs and switches; and confirmed all systems appeared to operational and with normal function.With the systems confirmed; Pilot ran [arrival] and [approach] checks for the RNAV RWY XX approach. Pilot requested to proceed directly inbound rather than execute the turn in holding; since the desired systems checks and prep for landing had been accomplished.Approaching the Final Approach Fix; Pilot extended gear; the right main gear was perceived as slow to extend; Pilot checked the bulb; which tested good; and stated; 'We've got a bad gear' to the Avionics Technician; and recycled the gear for a good down-and-locked indication. Pilot may have inadvertently keyed the mic when discussing gear with the Avionics Technician. Pilot reported Final Approach fix with gear for a full stop RWY XX. Approach and landing were uneventful.On shutdown; AUX tanks continued to indicate 80# left (13 gallons) and 60# right (10 gallons); physical check of these tanks showe",,,,"Cessna 310 pilot reported that both engines failed sequentially after the pilot left the fuel selector on AUX tanks during an approach. Pilot stated that after switching back to MAIN fuel tanks; power was restored in one engine and a single-engine approach was continued to landing.",

He contracts with an IA (Inspection Authority) whom I never met to perform the inspection. About 2 weeks ago the IA informed me that the right prop had a red dye leak and if it was still leaking after the run up it would need to be sent out for overhaul. He never called me back. So after two weeks I called and asked the A&P if the plane was finished. He told me they were still waiting on the new main gear tires but since the old ones were still legal I could pick up the plane and just have the tires installed after they arrived. I told him I would be there to pick up the plane on DATE. When I arrived to get the plane the tires had just arrived but were not installed. I paid for the maintenance and the inspection; did a quick look at the airframe logbook just to see the entry stating; 'This aircraft has been inspected in accordance with annual inspection....' And I saw the IA signature. I did not read the entire sign off. After a thorough preflight I departed ZZZ for the 15 minute uneventful VFR flight to ZZZ1. When I got home I sat down with logbooks to see what work they performed for $9;500.00. That's when I noticed that the airframe logbook entry's last sentence stated the aircraft was not airworthy for flight due to the red dye leak.I was shocked. It was my understanding if an aircraft wasn't approved then I would be notified by the IA and given a list of discrepancies stating that once the discrepancies were complied with it would then be considered airworthy and the annual complete.I have contacted a local ZZZ1 IA to remove the prop and send it to a propeller overhaul shop next week. He said he would talk to the previous IA to make sure that everything he needs complied with will be accomplished. I should have spent more time talking directly with the IA prior to picking up the aircraft and in the future I will thoroughly read all logbook entries following any aircraft maintenance to prevent any aircraft flights with an out of date annual inspection.",,,,"Pilot reported overlooking a log book entry after annual and flew the aircraft home with a discrepancy recorded against the propeller assembly for a red die leak.",

It was noted that the LH engine had an oil leak near the alternator. After cleaning the engine and performing a visual inspection; a dye penetrant inspection was conducted which revealed a crack a little over an inch located on the upper crankcase behind the alternator. The aircraft was removed from normal survey use to await replacement of the engine with an overhauled engine that had previously been ordered as a spare. One of our IAs remembered a service bulletin regarding repair of cracked crankcases. The service bulletin was associated with AD 77-XX-XX XX. If the case could be repaired; then the aircraft could be used to survey storm damage near ZZZ until the replacement engine arrived. The crack was repaired IAW section (c)(1) of the AD. We then determined it would be better if the alternator was removed so that the repaired area would not be stressed. The POH; 91.205; and the TCDS for the aircraft and engine were checked and nothing was found that would prevent operation in this configuration. A blocking plate was installed; the alternator circuit breaker was pulled and collared; the field fuse was removed; and a new weight and balance was calculated. The surveys can only occur during the day; so it was decided to restrict the aircraft to daytime VFR since the POH required electrical load to be maintained at less than 80% of the functional alternator.After FAA Aviation Safety Inspectors visited our location to perform OJT with logbooks from some of our aircraft and asked about the repair on Aircraft X; additional research found that a Master Minimum Equipment List exists for this aircraft and did not allow this configuration. The aircraft was immediately grounded and NAME was notified of the mistake. The alternator and drive coupling were replaced with new units to restore the aircraft to its original configuration. The aircraft will not be put back into service until the replacement engine has been installed. Maintenance entries for the work performed were not placed into the logbooks or signed. It had been the practice of the company to work off discrepancy/corrective action work sheets and then create a handwritten draft of the maintenance entries before storing them digitally onto computer or iPad until the aircraft was preparing to leave Maintenance at ZZZ. Before the aircraft would return to survey work away from home base; all the maintenance entries would be printed; signed; and placing into the appropriate logbooks. This was done to condense/compile all the maintenance entries - all entries would be organized and entered at the same time. The maintenance entries for Aircraft X were updated on DATE1 after the mistake was discovered.The main factor involved is lack of assertiveness. After I was shown the POH and checked the TCDS for the engine and airframe; I relied on the judgement and knowledge of the IA. I had once checked a Master Minimum Equipment List for a King Air at my previous job but was not aware that they existed for the T310R. I should have gone beyond 91.205 to 91.213 which would have answered the question. In the future I will trust in my own judgement and ability to research the FARs.",,,,"Technician reported variance from the MMEL during an engine repair.

It isn't uncommon for us to get VFR aircraft from that position descending to stay clear of the Class Bravo. When Aircraft X checked in I didn't notice that they were IFR and issued the normal pattern entry instruction for ZZZ from that direction. As a pilot myself I would have expected the pilot of Aircraft X to correct me and let me know that they were IFR when I issued VFR pattern entry instructions; but they didn't say anything; and I didn't notice. As the aircraft approach the reporting point for ZZZ Tower I issued them a frequency change. It wasn't until I observed the low altitude alert go off that something wasn't correct.I initially assumed that perhaps the Tower had turned on MSAW inadvertently.

As I approached the vicinity of the airport two aircraft announced their positions. One was departing and the other landing. Accordingly I announced that I would maneuver south of the airport and make a 45-degree entry to downwind. I verified that no aircraft were on downwind; and I entered downwind. During that time a helicopter announced they were entering a right-hand pattern. These opposed patterns are standard for fixed wing and helicopter aircraft at ZZZ. I continued making position reports and searched for the helicopter; but could not locate him. As I turned and announced base; the helicopter pilot announced that he had me in sight. I thanked him and continued; while searching. As I turned onto final approach I saw the helicopter a few hundred feet above me and to my right on approach. I continued and landed. Although we maintained visual separation and I was preceding the helicopter in the pattern; this was a closer conflict than I intended. What could I have done better? First; I could have made better use of the traffic depiction capabilities of my aircraft. Other aircraft were in the pattern; and my attention was in looking outside; merging into the pattern; and configuring my plane for landing. However; later I determined that I could have usefully increased the zoom of my traffic  display to better observe all the traffic in the pattern. I applied see-and-avoid for the approach; but I now think that situational awareness would be increased while approaching the pattern by giving some attention to my traffic depiction display at a useful zoom. Second; I could have asked the other pilots more specifically their positions and whether they had my plane in sight. I could have confirmed that they were following me (or not) as I entered the empty downwind leg. This was especially true of the opposite-hand helicopter traffic and their intentions. Although brevity on frequency is taught and I attempt to be succinct in order to not block the busy communications frequency; this circumstance might have warranted a discussion. Third; I could have circled outside the pattern until I had visually identified the traffic (although I judged that visual identification of the helicopter from my initial position outside the pattern was not likely). Because the airport is [special airspace]; I try to promptly enter the pattern and land after ZZZ1 ATC instructs me to change to unicom frequency. I now think that busy and opposite hand patterns would warrant circling near the airport; outside the landing pattern before entering to land in order to positively identify traffic in the pattern.",,,,"Pilot reported a NMAC during base turn for landing with a helicopter also on base turn.

We monitored gauges and at approximately XA15 we noticed the #4 cylinder was running hotter than all the other cylinders. We attempted to enrich the fuel to cool that cylinder. We then noticed our oil pressure was fluctuating. A few minutes later we noticed the oil pressure drop further. We discussed returning to ZZZ. Then we heard a loud bang in the engine area. We started losing power. We enriched full in prop and mixture. I pressed 'nearest airport' on my GPS. ZZZ2 was 3 miles away and we made a call to ZZZ1.

After departure from ZZZ; as part of the checklist; I moved the landing gear actuator switch from the down position to the up and heard the gear motor retraction noise as usual. Then I noticed that the gear up light was not lit. I retracted flaps and focused on flying the aircraft through busy airspace until I was north of the Class Bravo shelf. I recall notifying ATC at some point that I may be having a problem with gear. I then consulted the Pilot Operating Handbook I had onboard as well as verified the gear lever was in the up position; checked circuit breakers and tested the gear up lamp.  All checked good but the gear up lamp still was not showing lit. I also was able to look at the nose gear mirror that is mounted on the left engine nacelle and I observed the nose gear partially deployed. Based on all of this; I proceeded towards ZZZ1 with the intention of performing a precautionary landing; notifying ATC of my observation and intent. Upon arriving to the area northeast of ZZZ1; I extended the landing gear and observed two out of three green lights lit. I check to see if the third light - the unlit nose gear light - was loose or burned out; which it wasn't. I observed visually via the nose gear mirror that that the nose gear was still in the same partially extended position. I coordinated with ATC to maneuver some more in order to run checklists and then to prepare for the precautionary landing. Based on the location of ZZZ1 airport; runway length and no RSA; I decided to proceed to ZZZ2. On my way to ZZZ2; I became aware via Approach that ZZZ3 and Victorville had emergency services available on the field while ZZZ4 did not. I then amended my destination plan to ZZZ3 where I proceeded to burn off some unneeded Avgas. After some maneuvering attempt to pitch and roll the aircraft in order to attempt to get the nose gear to lock over center and stay - attempts that were unsuccessful; I proceeded to ZZZ3.I did a low altitude flyby of the tower for a gear check. Tower said that they saw the two main gear appear to be fully extended and the nose gear was partially extended. I proceeded to perform a precautionary landing on Runway XX; following the aircraft's POH including the checklist for landing with a defective nose gear - gear switch down; 105 MPH approach; flaps 20; all electrical off; landing in slightly tail low attitude; placing mixture controls into idle cut off and trying to keep the nose up as long as possible. As the aircraft slowed down; the nose started to pitch down and then came to rest on the runway.  I slid to a stop; place the fuel selectors in the off position and exited the aircraft. Being a participant in the program as well as my own activities around emergency procedures training helped me be prepared for that day. I appreciate the excellent support provided by ATC and the staff at ZZZ5 airport. Personnel in the vicinity of the airport were able to lift the nose of the aircraft with a forklift like telehandler. The nose gear was free swinging. The nose gear was then pulled forward by hand into the down and over center position where then we manually locked the nose gear into place to keep it from unlocking. The staff was able to coordinate the movement of the aircraft off the runway and into a parking spot. This aircraft was serviced as part of annual inspection last October and included the Cessna prescribed landing gear rigging. I felt very comfortable that the landing gear was up to spec and have had no issues with it the whole time. But I don't think that mechanical failures can be effectively and completely removed from aviation and for me in this case; training for emergencies; staying calm; not rushing and following checklists helped keep me safe.",,,,"C310 Pilot reported nose gear failure resulted in a safe landing.",

After departure checklist and while level under the Class B shelf; I noticed a high oil temperature indication on the Multi-function Flight Display (MFD); indicating an oil temperature pegged out on the 250 deg. F scale. I alerted the pilot flying and he reduced throttle settings; resulting in the temperature falling to 230; then returning to 250 degrees F.  I alerted the Pilot Flying that we needed to return to the field and directed him to begin a turn direct to ZZZ. I contacted Tower; but was unable to get through on the Tower XXX.X frequency.
